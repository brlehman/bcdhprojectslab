The Slate Roof House, with its traditions of Penn, has gone within the last few years, and the Franklin Library has been upholstered in the newest fashion, and now the house in which Jefferson was supposed to have written the Declaration is being destroyed. A change, too, has come over “society.” Once this was the city in which family antecedents were prized most highly, but now wealth has fought its way, and even the exclusive Assembly Balls have changed their character. The very names of some of the streets have been altered, though the principal ones still bear the titles bestowed by the founder of the city, Walnut Street, Chestnut Street, Vine Street, Mulberry Street, etc., taking their names from the abundance of the trees which used to flourish in them. But in spite of all changes Philadelphia retains a very high position, and many of the innovations which are to be met with daily in cities like New York and Baltimore are not tolerated here. For instance, “society ladies” do not attempt to paint their faces and improve their natural charms, after the fashion set by many of their sisters in other places. A leading doctor in Philadelphia told me that a Baltimore lady who was staying here lately attempted to walk down Chestnut Street as she did at home, but found herself subjected to comments which were far from pleasant, and was obliged to abandon the rouge which she could indulge in freely elsewhere, as she was fortunately unwilling to place herself in a mistaken position. The Quaker leaven still works with good results, though many old customs have been laid aside with the slate-coloured bonnets, cloaks, and old-fashioned prejudices. A healthy spirit of activity and desire for mental culture prevails, and the Philadelphian ladies are first and foremost in all good works.",82-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The very streets have an English look about them, and the conditions of life here are much more like those of the mother country, to say nothing of the people, who undoubtedly retain many of the characteristics of their ancestors. It is far less cosmopolitan than New York, which Joaquin Miller describes as “an iron-fronted, ironfooted, and iron-hearted town;” further declaring, that its screaming, screeching, swift, and very crooked elevated railroad is just typical of the city itself—“iron, all iron, iron and paint.” Commerce and money-getting are certainly the features of New York; everybody dabbles in stocks, and Wall Street is the centre of interest. The very boys know how many thousands there are in a million before they learn the commandments. But in Boston a different spirit prevails. Life is taken far more quietly, less at high pressure, and people are valued more for their culture than their wealth. The ladies are equally remarkable for their “independence,” but less for their dress. The gay colours I noticed in New York are not to be seen here. The houses are far more like homes, and if they have not the magnificence of the Fifth Avenue palaces, they all contain more or less of a library of books. A literary atmosphere pervades the place. Indeed, Boston is the acknowledged centre of intellectual culture and literary work. Some writers declare that Boston is losing her mental preeminence, that there are no rising authors to take the places of those literary giants who once made her famous, and that she will soon cease to be regarded as the “Athens of America.” The true Bostonian indignantly disclaims this allegation, and declares “that more culture to the square inch was never known there” than exists at the present moment in the “hub of the universe;” so much so, that “a little English Philistinism would be a positive relief,” retorted a New England journalist with whom I was discussing the accusation of “decadence.”",96-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grace Greenwood once told me she regarded Chicago as “New York with the heart left in;” but unable to yield this tribute without an accompanying joke, she added that the genuine Chicagoan had not only learned the Scotchman's prayer, “Lord, gie us a gude conceit o' oorsels,” but had it abundantly answered! Thus it is alleged that when a truespirited citizen from Chicago first visits New York, he exclaims, “It isn't much of a city after all.” When he drinks New York whisky he complains it isn't half as good as he gets at home, for it only burns “half-way down”! The Sunday newspapers can't compare with his; and as for the feet to be seen on Fifth Avenue, he contemptuously remarks, “Call that a foot!—our girls have them twice the size!” Of course this is a gross libel on the cultured representative of the West. The history of Chicago is indeed without a parallel. Fifty years back it was the haunt of the Indian and wolf; and to-day, in spite of the fearful fire of 1871, it has magnificent buildings, law-courts, public libraries, churches, and hotels. The Palmer House, an entirely fireproof building, is one of the best hotels in America, thanks to the untiring energy of its courteous manager, Mr. Willis Howe. The splendid houses on Michigan and Prairie Avenues are models of taste and elegance, and those who have had the good fortune to gain access to the right set, find in Chicago a thoroughly refined and cultivated society.",51-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here I was told that while the question of co-education was being discussed in the Eastern States it had been practically settled in the West. At the President's house at Ann Arbour I had the pleasure of meeting Andrew White, then President of Cornell, and I heard him lecture on “The Battlefields of Science,” describing the opposition which had been encountered in every period of history from superstition and fanaticism. The following day Professor Coit Tyler took me over the University, which is organised in three departments—literature, science, and arts; medicine and surgery; and law. I saw the women students attending all classes save the medical; here they have separate lectures and clinical demonstrations. One of these I attended personally, and when it concluded the sixty women left the room, and in another moment their places were filled by men, who listened to the same lecture we heard, accompanied by the same illustrations. “Far from injuring the scholarship here,” remarked one of the graduates, “they are, by their earnestness and fidelity, stimulating it; their presence is beginning to give class-room conversation that delicate, chaste, and humane tone which the recognition of women among the readers of books has been giving to English literature during the last hundred years.” The President assured me that none of the ladies had found the curriculum too heavy for their physical endurance, adding emphatically, “any woman who can endure the strain that modern dress and modern society make upon her, can certainly endure any college course of instruction.” The same testimony was afforded by President White of Cornell, who declared it would be difficult to find women in better health than those at Cornell, and that “the effect of study was far less disastrous than frivolous, aimless lives.” President Warren, of the Boston University, has also recently stated that he could not recall a single instance in nine years of a girl's health giving way from overwork.",56-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suppose when one remembers how the city stands in the midst of an alkali desert—that twenty years ago it was “a sparsely-settled village with only log cabins, in which dwelt people in constant dread of Indians, who were expected to scalp every one in the place before nightfall —it is marvellous to think what has been already accomplished there in such a short space of time, and in the face of such difficulties. The streets are full of activity; there fine houses and fast horses; carriages are to be seen with heraldic crests familiar to Europeans, but somewhat out of place in this land of equality. “Yes,” said a friend, in answer to a remark I made, “it reminds me of the old saying, people nowadays use coats of arms who wore coats without arms a few years back.” Considerable extravagance is also to be seen—gorgeous clothes and pretentious entertainments; but at the same time there is energy and liberality—schools have been built, an excellent university opened, and if Denver has the faults, she has also the virtues, of a new wealthy Western city. The Tabor Opera-house justly ranks as one of the finest theatres in America, and I saw it under the best possible circumstances. The Italian Opera Company arrived in Denver during one of my visits there, and Colonel Mapleson kindly invited me to be present on the opening night; so I not only heard Gerster sing, but saw the rank, fashion, and beauty of the city assembled to welcome her. Patti received an immense ovation next day, but I had to leave for Greeley—a town founded by Horace Greeley and his friend Mr. Meeker, on strictly temperance principles. The Indians not only resented the intrusion of the white men, but were rendered furious by the introduction of the agricultural machines they brought with them, and Mr. Meeker soon fell a prey to their vengeance.",128-30,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The “far West,” so often represented as a “wilderness,” given over to the reign of the wild “riotous rancheman,” where a race of ignorant backwoodsmen can alone be expected, is in reality peopled by the adventurous sons of Britain and young collegians from the more crowded Eastern States of America. Colorado Springs is, in fact, a very exceptional place, for its wonderful health-giving properties have attracted some of the best people from other cities, and it is really a charming resort. The streets are lined with trees—there are more than 7000 in this small town—and there are few days in the year when even invalids cannot venture out of doors. The dryness of the ground, the electric air, and the bright warm sunshine, render croquet and tennis pleasurable pursuits even in winter. No liquor can be sold, as every deed of land contains the forfeiture clause; nevertheless wine is to be found on the tables of the hospitable and wealthy inhabitants.",138,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naples and Edinburgh justly pride themselves upon their surroundings, but the “Queen,” or “Bay City” of California is simply perfect; with the Pacific Ocean at her feet, the Golden Gate which leads to the harbour, and the hills on all sides, she has a position of unrivalled beauty. The drives through the Park to the Cliff House and to the Presidio, the military post, and to Fort Point, are magnificent. A few years since this park of 11,000 acres was a sand waste. Now it is covered for the most part with grass plots, thousands of trees have been planted in it, pines, cypresses, mimosas, and the evergreen Australian gum-tree; the brilliant scarlet geraniums are growing eight feet high, and flowering shrubs on all sides delight the eye, while the air is filled with their sweet fragrance. The Golden Gate is of course seen to most perfection by those who enter the harbour by sea, but I was quite content with looking at it from the surrounding hills, and I shall long remember a pleasant day spent at the Cliff House, where some Californian friends entertained us at luncheon, and we spent the afternoon watching the far-famed seal rocks, where hundreds of sea lions disport themselves—sometimes basking in the glorious sun, then diving into the water, talking in their strange language, with the peculiar bark for which they are noted, their weird and discordant voices being heard far above the Pacific Ocean breakers which wash the shores. This is justly esteemed one of the city's chief attractions, and these rocks and their inhabitants are rigorously protected by the authorities. “Why are these splendid mansions built of wood instead of granite or even brick?” is the natural question which rises to one's lips on being introduced to the magnificent houses of Mrs. Mark Hopkins, Mr. Crocker, Mr. Leland Stanford, and other millionaires in California Street. Some people told me it was ordained by the imperative law of fashion; a physician assured me “that stone houses were damp and unsuitable in this climate,” others darkly intimated it was due to the frequency of earthquakes. Let the reason be what it may, the fact remains that the first stone residence has only just been commenced for Mr. James G. Flood. It may perhaps bring about a new era in house building, but the house itself will not be completed for two years. It will be built of brown stone from the Connecticut quarries, of the same character as that so largely used in New York, although granite quarries abound in the immediate neighbourhood of this city. In the meantime the wooden houses, built of red pine wood, and heated throughout with furnaces, are terribly dangerous: when they once catch fire it is difficult to stop the conflagration or prevent it from spreading. Two blocks from the Palace Hotel, a large lumber yard, close to the shipping docks, caught fire one night, and I watched from the windows of the beautiful suite of rooms always occupied by Christine Nilsson during her visits to this city, one of the most terrible fires I ever saw. For some time it seemed as if nothing would avert its progress, and the greatest excitement prevailed. At times the flames seemed nearing the Grand Hotel just opposite, at other times they lighted up the ships in the harbour, till they stood out like so many spectre vessels. At last, in a lull of the smoke which was being vomited forth while blazing rafts shot up into the evening skies, we saw that the brave men had reached the roof, and had the fire-hose in full operation on the burning pile; and after considerable efforts it was evident that the fire was under control. The fire-brigade here is in splendid condition; more than three hundred men are engaged in the service. The average number of fires is twenty-five in a month, and the red pinewood, though it soon makes a fierce blaze, also absorbs the water very rapidly, so that a well-directed stream early applied saves many a house, thanks to the promptitude of the fire patrol.",212-214,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severance's charming ground-floor house, covered with clematis, roses, and passionflowers, in which I spent such a pleasant time at Los Angeles, in watching, without raising
my head from the pillow, the dark emerald green of the orange groves, rich with golden
fruit. The trees grew close to the verandah on which my windows opened, and were not
only laden with oranges, but full of the delicate blossoms on the wearing of which hang
the hopes of the maidens of most nations; ripe fruit and flower growing side by side is a
characteristic feature of the orange tree. So heavily weighted were some of the branches
that they had broken off the tree, and fallen to the ground with the luscious goldencoloured balls, some of which measured eleven inches in circumference.
But the truth must be told, and lovely as the fruit is to look at, these oranges are not yet as
pleasant to the taste as those grown in Florida. This is said to be owing to the growth of
the tree; so time, the great cure for all human ills, will doubtless come to the rescue in due
course. Already tropical fruits of all kinds are growing,—lemons, limes, citrons, pomegranates,
figs, olives, etc., and no part of the Pacific coast has made such wonderful strides during
the past few years as Southern California, for everything grows here with spontaneous
productiveness, without fear of frost or blight. The great question on which the permanent
prosperity and growth depend is that of irrigation , in consequence of the lightness of the
usual rainfall.
This year, however, will be celebrated as an exceptional one in the farmer's calendar, for
ere I left the quaint old Spanish town, “the city of the angels,” I watched the orange groves
through the driving rain, and saw the golden balls scattered on the ground as thickly as the grass in an English orchard is strewn with pears and apples after an autumn storm. I
realised also what a flood can do in the “glorious climate of California.”...I left Los Angeles knee-deep in mud. Piled up all through the principal thoroughfares were
high mounds of mud to render the streets at all passable, and as these were allowed to
remain for days, to the danger of health as well as safety, some local satirist carved fancy
wooden tombstones, on which was written: “Sacred to the memory of the City Fathers,”
and placed them in derision on the mounds. The day after I departed the largest reservoir
in the city burst and destroyed the lower portion of the town; and so disastrous did the
floods prove to the Southern Pacific Railroad that our train was the last for five days to
leave the dépôt, and traffic was suspended in all directions.",246-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/05740/05740.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
