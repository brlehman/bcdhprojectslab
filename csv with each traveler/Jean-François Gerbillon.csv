The Country is divided into Provinces the most Western is Solon, by the Ruffians call’d Dawra , which is rather the Name of a Nation than a Country. It begins at the Confluence of the Ergonê and Saghalian ula, along which latter it extends above 150 Leagues towards Ningûta. The Governor told me there were not above 10,000 Families in the Pro-vince. They are great Hunters, dextrous Archers, and pay their Tribute in Sable-skins, each Family two, three, or more a Year, according to the Number of able Persons.
 In the whole Country there is but one Town, called Merghen, or Merghin, built and garrison'd by the Emperor ; every where else are nothing but Huts. The Ruffians indeed had a Fortress here, which they called Albazin, and the Tartars Takfa, from a little River on which it stood where it runs into the Saghalian ula. This Fortress occafion’d the War between the Emperor and the Ruffians, the Garrison disturbing the Chinese Sable-Hunters ; but at length the Fort was demolish’d, and the Country yielded to the Emperor by the Treaty of Nipchu.",256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E. till having passed the Point of the Mountain, (which was near our Camp, and lies due West from the Confluence of the little River Tirelki and the Tula) it turns directly West. It is considerably larger than the Kerlon , and its Stream exceeding clear, running over a Bottom of Flints and Pebbles. Its Banks are very agreeable, being covered with various Sorts of beautiful and bushy Trees. In its Course it forms several little Istes, full of most de-lightful GroveS, and we found a Coolness in the Air that was very refreshing in this hot Season. The River is very rapid, and on both Sides without the Trees is a Meadow abounding with excellent Fo-rage. This is certainly the most agreeable Place I had seen in all my Travels into Tartary.",373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
