It is a beautiful and thriving town, and with the advantages of both a natural and artificial navigation, is destined to become one of the most important places in the state. Its present population is estimated at upwards of 12,-000, and the number of buildings at rising of 2000. The Erie canal commences in this village, near the outlet of the Buffalo creek, and passes through an extensive and perfectly level plot, equidistant from the shore of the lake and the high grounds called the Terrace. From the canal are cut, at very suitable distances, lateral canals and basins, rendering the whole of the lower town contiguous to water communication. Stores and warehouses are so constructed as to receive the boats along side. In its location, Biiffalo is in the midst of the enterprize and business of this new world. All the manufactures and migrating population from the north and east here find a resting place, and the agricultural products of the west, coming from the long extended lakes, here seek a new avenue to the Atlantic, The lower town is rapidly spreading over that part below the Terrace, where begins a gentle and equal rise of ground, continuing nearly and perhaps quite two miles, and then falls away to a perfect level as far as the eye can reach, bounded only by the horizon. Upon this elevated ground there is a charming view of the lake, Niagara river, the canal with all its branches, the Buffalo creek, the town itself, and the Canada shore; a prospect from which every one parts with reluctance. The streets are very broad, and passing from high grounds over the Terrace to the water, are intersected with cross streets. There are three public squares of some extent, which add much to the beauty of the town. The public buildings are a court-house, situated on the highest part of Main-street, well proportioned and handsomely ornamented. The large park in front of it, which has been recently enclosed and set round with forest trees, will in a short time add much to the beauty of this part of the town.",255-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
