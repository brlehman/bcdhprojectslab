Ash,1833,Male,England,English,,,1833,,19th century,1830s,39.9581,-75.1544,Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",United States of America,Nothern America,North America,"At length Philadelphia makes its appearance, stretching for nearly three miles along the western side of a bend or angle of the river. This view is certainly a fine one, but it would be much improved by the appearance of a few more steeples or lofty structures. From the water two or three only are visible above this immense assemblage of red houses; and yet the city contains nine episcopal churches, a great number of public buildings, and charitable institutions without end. Great attention is paid to the education of the poorer classes: the constitution of Pennsylvania declaring, “That the legislature shall, as soon as convenient, provide by law for the establishment of schools, in such manner that the poor may be educated without expense.” Philadelphia has been often described. The streets cross each other at right angles: those running parallel with the river are numbered, second, third, fourth, &c.; the others usually bear the name of some fruit or tree. The word street is usually omitted: in describing the way, a person would tell you that the place you were looking for was in Walnut, below fifth; Sassafras, above second; Mulberry, between seventh and eighth, &c. These streets run over a distance of two miles, from the Delaware to the Schuylkill river, which enters the Delaware about seven miles to the south of Philadelphia. The Bank of Pennsylvania is a small building, but elegantly designed from the Temple of the Muses, on the Illyssus, near Athens.",11-12,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was here for the first time I saw that beautiful river; in breadth about three quarters of a mile. Its clear and shallow stream is not really slow, but at a little distance it appears as tranquil and unruffled as the surface of a lake. Immediately opposite to Harrisburg is an island, from either side of which a long wooden bridge is thrown to the opposite bank of the river. Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania, and is a thriving, neat and pretty-looking town, containing about four thousand inhabitants. The house of assembly, or capitol, as it is always called in America, is built on an eminence. The sittings of the senate and house of representatives of Pennsylvania were held first at Philadelphia, then at Lancaster, and subsequently for nearly the last twenty years at Harrisburg, which, from its central situation, has been found much more convenient....The view from the dome of the capitol at Harrisburg is very fine; but a much better is obtained from the summit of a hill about a mile behind the town, although, perhaps, the town itself is not seen to such advantage. A great part of the surrounding country is very well cultivated; corn-fields, pasture and woodlands, are distributed over hill and hollow; and occasionally here and there is perceived a small farm-house, of a neater and more English appearance than any I had yet seen. On every side the landscape is terminated as usual by a boundless forest. The Susquehanna seems to lose itself through a gap in the Blue Mountains; and throughout the whole of its course, which is visible for a great distance, its banks and beautiful islands are clothed with the richest foliage to the water's edge. I proceeded along the north bank of the river towards Duncan's Island, and after a ride of eight or nine miles, I arrived at the gap I have just mentioned. Its scenery forcibly reminded me of the Rhine at Drachenfells. The abrupt and lofty hill on the left is not surmounted by a “castled crag,” but it overhangs, perhaps, a nobler river, whose banks are covered with the forest trees of America, instead of being formally scarped for the culture of vines, trimmed like gooseberry bushes. At a short distance from the gap, the river is crossed by an enormous wooden bridge of eight arches, which is very nearly half a mile in length. The bridges in America are usually of wood, of admirable construction, neatly painted, and covered over like many of the bridges in Switzerland.",25-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is almost exclusively the property of one English gentleman, who is master of nearly 70,000 acres in that part of the country. While I partook of his hospitality, I was agreeably surprised by the circle of English society, which I found collected under his roof. Several English have made Philipsburg their place of residence. Its advantages consist in a remarkably healthy situation on the western slope of the Alleghanies, where the descent is so gradual as to be hardly perceptible; an easy and constant communication with Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the Ohio; excellent trout-fishing, and shooting in the forest; a very cheap market (a sheep or deer can be bought for a dollar), and excellent medical advice. Uncleared land may be purchased at one, two, or three dollars an acre...At Philipsburg, and in the neighbourhood, are several iron works. I visited a curious screw manufactory there: the machine for heading the screws was invented on the spot, and probably there is not such another to be found any where. It turned out about sixty screws in a minute, and finished them off with a neatness that would excite the surprise even of a mechanist.",36-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its situation is much finer than that of Philadelphia. It is not so fine as that of New York; but in some respects, is, I think, superior to Boston. When approached by water, the most conspicuous objects are—Washington's monument, the shot-towers, the Roman Catholic cathedral, and the Unitarian church, all scattered in different parts of the city. Washington's monument is a plain column of marble, raised on a square base, 175 feet in height, and surmounted by a colossal statue of Washington. It is seen from a great distance on every side, and commands the finest and most extensive prospect; but I am very much inclined to doubt the taste that placed any other than an allegorical object on the top of a lofty pillar. The size of the column, and its simplicity, are calculated to excite admiration; but in my humble judgment, it would have been much better to have had a really fine statue placed inside the base of the column, than to perch the general upon a height that would make a living admiral feel giddy. Lord Hill's monument, near Shrewsbury, and that to the memory of General Brock, at Queenstown, are, I think, objectionable, for the same reasons. The battle monument is much prettier, although it is somewhat florid in its ornaments: it is fiftyfour feet in height. The column is a circular fasces, symbolical of the Union, twined round with fillets, bearing the names of those who fell on the 12th and 13th of September, 1814; and supporting an allegorical statue of a female, personifying the city of Baltimore, with a bald eagle, the United States' emblem, at her side. The Archbishop of Maryland is the Metropolitan of the States. The Catholic cathedral is a handsome building, with a dome in imitation of the Pantheon. The inside, which is divided into pews, contains two very good pictures from the French school: a descent from the cross, by Paul Guerin, presented by Louis XVI.; and St. Louis burying his dead officers and soldiers before Tunis, by Steuben, presented by Charles X. The descent from the cross is much and deservedly admired. It has the merit of being free from that tedious detail that is usually to be observed in the works of French artists, who paint every thing as it is, and not as it appears. It occurred to me, that the body of Christ did not sufficiently rest on the ground, as intended. The latter picture displays more of the French taste. I did not like it so well, but many prefer it to the other. At Baltimore, is the University of Maryland, which ranks very high as a medical school. The average expenses of a student are one hundred and twenty dollars per annum. It has also professors in law and divinity. St. Mary's College and Baltimore College are also justly celebrated throughout the Union; the latter will accomodate one hundred and fifty students, who are instructed, by twelve professors, in the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, &c. The city also contains a good museum, which I did, and many more public buildings, which I did not visit, as I could not learn that there was any thing in them particularly deserving of attention. The theatre was not open.",46-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ash,1833,Male,England,English,,,1833,,19th century,1830s,40.4407,-80.0023,Pittsburgh,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",United States of America,Nothern America,North America,"As I approached Pittsburgh the forest became less extensive, and the country exhibited a more general appearance of cultivation, although it may be broadly asserted that the Americans are at least fifty years behind us in agriculture; yet there are many gentlemen's estates on which more than ordinary care and labour have been bestowed, and which, consequently, are far in advance of others. I observed some good farming adjacent to the road. Some part of the country I am speaking of, might have been mistaken for the more woody parts of England, had it not been for the worm or zigzag fence which is in universal use throughout the United States, and offers but a poor apology for the English hedge row, although they are sometimes composed of cedar logs. Pittsburgh is built on the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, both of them being about a quarter of a mile in width, whose united streams form the Ohio. They are both passed by a fine wooden bridge. The city contains 12,000 inhabitants; but if the suburbs are included in the calculation, its population will amount to nearly 23,000. It may be called the western capital of Pennsylvania. It manufactures annually about 18,000 tons of iron, and the same quantity of steel. It has also an extensive manufactory of cotton and glass. Bituminous coal is found in the greatest plenty in the neighbourhood, and in consequence of the smoke and black dust from the manufactories, the shop-keepers complain that it is impossible to keep any thing clean. I entered Pittsburgh on the 4th of July, on which day, as every one knows, the Declaration of Independence was signed at Philadelphia. It is, of course, always and universally a day of rejoicing in the United States. The militia are called out, a public dinner is always given in every town and village in the Union and an appropriate oration is delivered by the appointed orator of the day.",109-110,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the last twenty, the road runs along the banks of the Ohio, passing through the most magnificent forest of the beech trees I had ever beheld. There is nothing remarkable in the appearance of Louisville. It is a large and regularly built town, containing 11,000 inhabitants. From this place the larger steamboats start for New Orleans. Those that come from Pittsburgh are of smaller dimensions, on account of the shallowness of the water. The course of the Ohio from Pittsburgh to Louisville is about 600 miles, and thence, to its confluence with the Mississippi, is nearly 300 more. The length of the Mississippi, from its junction with the Ohio, is 1200. The falls, or rapids of the Ohio, are immediately below Louisville, and part of them may be seen from the town.",127,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The streets are spacious and regular,—the largest is more than half a mile in length, and contains some excellent shops and a capital hotel. That part of the bank upon which the city is built, is slightly elevated above the rest of the country, and commands a view which, although generally flat, is far from being uninteresting. The farms are laid out in narrow slips of land, which run parallel to each other, and at right angles to the river, reaching to the edge of the forest, distant about two miles from the city. By this means the first settlers were enabled to build their habitations within a short distance of each other; they had a smaller space of road to keep in repair, and afforded each other a mutual support against the sudden attacks of the Indians. At Detroit, the American General Hull surrendered to General Brock during the last war, but the city was subsequently retaken, previously to the battle of the Thames.",138-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ash,1833,Male,England,English,,,1833,,19th century,1830s,42.359,-71.0624,Boston,"Boston, Massachusetts",United States of America,Nothern America,North America,"I entered Boston by the light of innumerable lamps, that plainly marked the direction of its many bridges, and took up my quarters at the Tremont hotel,—decidedly, taken altogether, the best house in the United States. The table and the bed-rooms were equally good, which is not the case at any other I had seen. In appearance it more resembles a government building than a hotel. Breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper are served up, as usual, at a certain hour; and although that hour at breakfast time is liberally extended, yet if it happens that a person be detained too long, he must either go without his dinner, or put up with cold and disfigured viands placed before him with an ill grace by a tired waiter, or pay extra for a meal expressly served up for him; as the hotel charges are two, or two dollars and a half a-day, and it makes no difference whether he attends the table d'hote or not. The principal theatre is exactly opposite the Tremont. The front is ornamented with Ionic pilasters supporting an entablature and pediment. The interior is tastefully arranged, but is seldom visited by the first circles. The Indian name of Boston was Shawmut, its first English appellation was Trimountain, and its present name was given in 1630. At an early day after my arrival, I took the opportunity of ascending the capitol, which stands on the most elevated corner of “the Common.” The Common, according to the usual English signification of the word, deserves a better name, as it is the prettiest promenade in the States. It contains about seventy-five acres, disposed in a sloping direction from north to south, varied by other eminences, of which the most conspicuous is formed by the not yet quite levelled remains of the British fortifications of 1775. It is surrounded by trees, and the best houses in Boston; some of them being large and handsome, and not the less deserving of the epithet because they are of a stone colour, or any other than that of red brick. But at Boston generally I observed greater taste in this respect than in any other of the cities which I visited. On one side of the Common is a mall, or promenade, formed by parallel avenues of fine elm trees; but yet, notwithstanding the beauty of its situation, it is deserted by the Boston belles for the gay glitter of the fashionable shops in Cornhill or Washington street. To the best of my recollection, every capitol or state-house that I have seen, or of which I have seen a picture, is surmounted by a dome or cupola,—that of Boston is particularly conspicuous; but the smoothness of its exterior is but ill assorted with the richness of the Corinthian columns in the facade: it should be grooved like the dome of St. Paul's. The present heavy appearance of the cupola at Washington would be very much improved if it were altered in a similar manner. The capitol at Boston contains a very fine statue of Washington, by Chantrey. From the top is obtained a fine panoramic view of the whole city, with the bay, its islands, and their fortifications; its bridges, wharfs, and enormous warehouses. On the north is the memorable Bunker's Hill, with part of the fine obelisk that is to be; the navy-yard, and the suburb of Charlestown. The bay of Boston, like that of New York, is fondly thought by some of the inhabitants of each city to be as fine, if not superior in beauty to that of Naples;—whether they have seen it or not, is of little consequence; the bay of Boston, with its flat treeless islands and head-lands, shall be as fine as the bay of Naples, and so may it remain! The city resembles Baltimore more than any other in the Union: as a collection of buildings it is prettier, but I prefer the environs of the latter city to the more distant hills that form the amphitheatre of Boston, which is too large to add much effect to the landscape. Boston contains 70,000 inhabitants, and the first bridge and the first canal in the United States were constructed there. It appeared to me the neatest city in the Union; and although there is no edifice particularly striking, yet there are many that are handsome, and there is an air of civic importance pervading every street in the place, so that the eye does not easily detect the absence of any object that is necessary to complete the appearance of a place of such pretensions as Boston. The Faneuil Hall, named after the founder, who lived a hundred years ago, must not be forgotten. It is the cradle of American liberty; because, within its walls were held and heard the consultations and the eloquence of those, who, more than fifty years back, were first aroused to resentment and resistance by the obstinacy of the government of England. It contains an original full-length portrait of Washington in his regimentals, by Stewart. The figure is excellent, but the horse is very indifferently executed. The other ornaments in the hall, are emblematical of the purposes to which it is applied. Public meetings and dinners are held there, and the company usually leave behind them the decorations that have been mottoed for the occasion. The name of “Skryznecki” was very conspicuous, among a multitude of others.",188-90,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/28360/28360.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
