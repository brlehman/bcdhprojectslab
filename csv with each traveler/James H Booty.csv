 some of the brightest eyes, and also some of the sweetest smiles that any one would ever wish to behold; had they but good figures, the picture would be complete; they dress with Parisian perfection, and in short they are considered the veriest little ducks in the world.
 I am sure the reader will not be surprised when I mention the fact, that “loafing” up and down Broadway is a favourite occupation with the young men who have leisure hours to spare....I must now say a few words respecting the state of the streets; the paving, except in

It commands an extensive view of the Ohio, and of the surrounding country. There are a great number of Churches, and Schools in the city, and also several Benevolent Institutions. Cincinnati is distinguished for the culture of the grape, and it is chiefly owing to the perseverance of Mr. Longworth, that they have been so far successful in producing wine.

The temperature of the cave is uniformly the same, both in summer and winter, viz 59 deg. Fahrenheit, remarkably dry, and of extraordinary salubrity, and hence considered highly beneficial for invalids. A short distance from the entrance you pass the remains of numerous Saltpetre Vats, as in 1814 immense quantities of Saltpetre were manufactured in the Cave, and although the manufacture has been stopped some long time, yet the quantity of nitrous earth still remaining is enormous. The first object of interest is the “Great Vestibule”, this vast chamber has one single unsupported arch, covering an area of one and a half acres of ground. The lofty roof, a hundred feet above your head, becomes at length dimly seen; a glimpse is obtained of its enormous dome, with great groined arches and lofty buttresses formed of stalactitic rock. A little further on we come to “Audubon's Avenue”, which extends for about half a mile, but presents nothing of very special interest; we then pass through the main Cave for another half mile, when we reach the “Kentucky Cliff's”, so called from a fancied resemblance to the Cliffs on the Kentucky River: then making a descent of about forty feet, we enter the “Church”. This is a grand apartment, a hundred feet in diameter, with a roof formed of one solid seamless rock suspended seventy feet overhead. Religious services have been performed in the dim religious light of torches, under this magnificent roof. The “Gothic Avenue” is next reached, it is forty feet high and thirty wide, and is nearly two miles in length.",32-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As early as 1764 St Louis was settled as a trading station for the trappers of the West; four years after it passed from the French into the hands of the Spaniards, who kept possession until it was transferred to the United States in 1804. The rapid increase of St Louis is almost as extraordinary as that of Cincinnati, and perhaps more so, when it is considered, not only that it is further west by hundreds of miles, but that it has to contend with the overflowing of the Mississippi, which has, on more than one occasion, risen to the first floor of the houses and stores built on the edge of the levee; fortunately, the greater part of the town, being built on higher ground, escapes the ruinous periodical inundations. In 1830 the population was under seven thousand, since which date the city has so rapidly increased, that in 1852 its population was bordering on 100,000. The natives of the United States form about one-half of the community, and those of Germany one-fourth; the remainder are chiefly Irish. The public edifices of St Louis, in its municipal buildings, churches, market-houses, and charitable institutions, are certainly creditable to the enterprise of the people. There are about forty churches, one fourth of which are Roman Catholic, many of them are very imposing. There are numerous manufacturing establishments in the city, amongst which flour-mills, and sugar refineries rank the foremost.",43-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the largest and most important city in Illinois, and in its rapid growth, the most remarkable in the Union. In 1831 it was only an Indian trading post, and as late as 1840 its population did not number 5000, while in 1857 it scarcely fell short of 160,000. The city is on the southern shore of Lake Michigan; the site is an extremely level plain, stretching away for miles in beautiful and fertile prairies. It is divided into three portions by the two branches of the Chicago River, which unite within a mile of the lake. The Michigan and the Wabash Avenues—the one on the lake shore and the other next behind—are noble thoroughfares, in their extent, their architecture, and, more especially, in their fine lines of noble trees; I enjoyed a walk in the afternoon in these beautiful Avenues. The most striking of the public edifices are the Merchants' Exchange and the Court House; I ascended to the summit of the latter and was well repaid for the trouble by the beautiful view of the city and the surrounding country. While I was in Chicago great and ruinous competition was being carried on by the Railway Companies running between that city and New York, (a distance of nearly a thousand miles); tickets were to be had to convey passengers the aforesaid distance for 12 dollars, and this went on for a fortnight....Chicago boasts of numerous very fine buildings, many of the “Stores” rivalling in extent and build with those in New York. It is wonderful to think of the surprising growth of this Western City, and the next few years (by which time they will have completed the improvement in the streets) will doubtless effect still greater strides in this enterprising place.",55-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What overcomes the visitor at first is the continual roar of the mass of mighty waters, it is perfectly deafening, but as soon as the ear becomes
 accustomed to it, they descend with a lulling and soothing sound. The noise of the Falls is sometimes heard at a very great distance, but of course it is constantly modified by the direction and strength of the wind. The great Lakes of North America—Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie—pour the flood of their accumulated waters into Lake Ontario, through a channel of about 36 miles in length. This channel is named the Niagara River, and is part of the boundary between Canada and the State of New York. Twenty two miles below its commencement at Lake Erie occur these celebrated Falls of Niagara. These Falls are divided into two by Goat Island. The Canadian or Horse-Shoe Fall is in reality Niagara itself, it is 2000 feet wide, and 160 feet high. The American Falls are 900 feet wide, and about 160 feet high, stupendous as they are, they must be considered no more than an offshoot from the main cataract. Over this magnificent precipice it is said the irresistible tide rushes at the rate of a hundred million tons of water every hour! Niagara, according to the testimony of all who dwell near it, is never more beautiful than in the cold midwinter, when no tourists visit it, and when the sides of the chasm are corrugated and adorned with pillars and stalactites of silvery frost; and when huge blocks of ice from Lake Erie, weighing hundreds of tons, are hurled down the Rapids and over the Falls, as if they were of no greater specific gravity than feathers or human bodies, and reappear half a mile lower down the river, shivered to numberless fragments. It is a tradition of Niagara that, in 1822 or 1823, such a thick wall of ice was formed above Goat Island that no water flowed past for several hours, and that in the interval the precipice at the Horse Shoe Fall was perfectly bare and dry. A picture of the scene, painted at the time, is still in existence.",61-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contains a population of 75,000. It is not only a beautiful but a solidly-built city, and wears a general air and aspect of strength befitting the climate. By the French Roman Catholics, who form nearly one half of the population, it is called affectionately the Ville Marie, or town of the Virgin Mary; the names of its principal streets, derived from those of the Saints in the Romish Calendar, testify alike to the fervency and to the faith of its founders. The quays of Montreal are unsurpassed by those of any city in America; built of solid limestone, and uniting with the locks and cut stone wharves of the Lachine Canal, they display for several miles a mass of continuous masonry. Unlike the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi, no unsightly warehouses disfigure the river side. A broad terrace, faced with gray limestone, the parapets of which are surmounted with a substantial iron railing, divides the city from the river throughout its whole length. Amongst the public buildings, the most remarkable is the Roman Catholic Cathedral; of the vastness of the interior of this edifice, an idea may be formed from the fact that it is capable of accommodating nearly 12,000 persons. The view from the summit of its towers, one of which I ascended embracing the city and its suburbs, the river, and the surrounding country—is exceedingly beautiful. Other elegant public edifices claim the attention of the visitor, also numerous banks, nunneries, and churches: all of these buildings are erected in a most durable manner.",71-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everybody who has seen or read of Quebec must remember the magnificent towering rock overhanging the river, on the summit of which the citadel is placed, forming at once the chief stronghold of its defence, and the grandest feature of its scenery. The city is divided into two sections, called the Upper and the Lower Towns; the Upper Town occupying the highest part of the promontory, which is surrounded by strong walls and other fortifications; and the Lower Town, being built around the base of Cape Diamond. The latter is the business quarter. I had not been many hours in Quebec before I stood at the wall of the citadel, overlooking the river from a dizzy height of 300 feet—the standard of Great Britain floating over my head; the red-coated soldiers of my native land pacing their rounds, and suggesting, by their general appearance, the dear old country, from which I was separated by so many thousand miles of ocean; and on the soil of whose noble colony I stood, and felt that I was no longer a “foreigner”, as I was sometimes reminded when in the United States. The Citadel with its numerous buildings covers about 40 acres; its impregnable position makes it perhaps the strongest fortresa on the American Continent. The view from the citadel is most lovely, taking in, as it does, the opposite banks of the great river for nearly 50 miles up and down. I heard it said, that a gentleman once remarked, that the only scene he knew more glorious than that which meets the eye from the citadel at Quebec was Rio Janeiro, which he believed to be by far the grandest in the world; but the Rio lacks the associations of Quebec. Who could forget that beneath its walls two chieftains, the bravest of the brave, fell on the same battle field.",75-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wine is called “Catawba”, and is made both still and sparkling.",22-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The temperature of the cave is uniformly the same, both in summer and winter, viz 59 deg. Fahrenheit, remarkably dry, and of extraordinary salubrity, and hence considered highly beneficial for invalids. A short distance from the entrance you pass the remains of numerous Saltpetre Vats, as in 1814 immense quantities of Saltpetre were manufactured in the Cave, and although the manufacture has been stopped some long time, yet the quantity of nitrous earth still remaining is enormous. The first object of interest is the “Great Vestibule”, this vast chamber has one single unsupported arch, covering an area of one and a half acres of ground. The lofty roof, a hundred feet above your head, becomes at length dimly seen; a glimpse is obtained of its enormous dome, with great groined arches and lofty buttresses formed of stalactitic rock. A little further on we come to “Audubon's Avenue”, which extends for about half a mile, but presents nothing of very special interest; we then pass through the main Cave for another half mile, when we reach the “Kentucky Cliff's”, so called from a fancied resemblance to the Cliffs on the Kentucky River: then making a descent of about forty feet, we enter the “Church”. This is a grand apartment, a hundred feet in diameter, with a roof formed of one solid seamless rock suspended seventy feet overhead. Religious services have been performed in the dim religious light of torches, under this magnificent roof. The “Gothic Avenue” is next reached, it is forty feet high and thirty wide, and is nearly two miles in length.",32-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As early as 1764 St Louis was settled as a trading station for the trappers of the West; four years after it passed from the French into the hands of the Spaniards, who kept possession until it was transferred to the United States in 1804. The rapid increase of St Louis is almost as extraordinary as that of Cincinnati, and perhaps more so, when it is considered, not only that it is further west by hundreds of miles, but that it has to contend with the overflowing of the Mississippi, which has, on more than one occasion, risen to the first floor of the houses and stores built on the edge of the levee; fortunately, the greater part of the town, being built on higher ground, escapes the ruinous periodical inundations. In 1830 the population was under seven thousand, since which date the city has so rapidly increased, that in 1852 its population was bordering on 100,000. The natives of the United States form about one-half of the community, and those of Germany one-fourth; the remainder are chiefly Irish. The public edifices of St Louis, in its municipal buildings, churches, market-houses, and charitable institutions, are certainly creditable to the enterprise of the people. There are about forty churches, one fourth of which are Roman Catholic, many of them are very imposing. There are numerous manufacturing establishments in the city, amongst which flour-mills, and sugar refineries rank the foremost.",43-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the largest and most important city in Illinois, and in its rapid growth, the most remarkable in the Union. In 1831 it was only an Indian trading post, and as late as 1840 its population did not number 5000, while in 1857 it scarcely fell short of 160,000. The city is on the southern shore of Lake Michigan; the site is an extremely level plain, stretching away for miles in beautiful and fertile prairies. It is divided into three portions by the two branches of the Chicago River, which unite within a mile of the lake. The Michigan and the Wabash Avenues—the one on the lake shore and the other next behind—are noble thoroughfares, in their extent, their architecture, and, more especially, in their fine lines of noble trees; I enjoyed a walk in the afternoon in these beautiful Avenues. The most striking of the public edifices are the Merchants' Exchange and the Court House; I ascended to the summit of the latter and was well repaid for the trouble by the beautiful view of the city and the surrounding country. While I was in Chicago great and ruinous competition was being carried on by the Railway Companies running between that city and New York, (a distance of nearly a thousand miles); tickets were to be had to convey passengers the aforesaid distance for 12 dollars, and this went on for a fortnight....Chicago boasts of numerous very fine buildings, many of the “Stores” rivalling in extent and build with those in New York. It is wonderful to think of the surprising growth of this Western City, and the next few years (by which time they will have completed the improvement in the streets) will doubtless effect still greater strides in this enterprising place.",55-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What overcomes the visitor at first is the continual roar of the mass of mighty waters, it is perfectly deafening, but as soon as the ear becomes
 accustomed to it, they descend with a lulling and soothing sound. The noise of the Falls is sometimes heard at a very great distance, but of course it is constantly modified by the direction and strength of the wind. The great Lakes of North America—Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie—pour the flood of their accumulated waters into Lake Ontario, through a channel of about 36 miles in length. This channel is named the Niagara River, and is part of the boundary between Canada and the State of New York. Twenty two miles below its commencement at Lake Erie occur these celebrated Falls of Niagara. These Falls are divided into two by Goat Island. The Canadian or Horse-Shoe Fall is in reality Niagara itself, it is 2000 feet wide, and 160 feet high. The American Falls are 900 feet wide, and about 160 feet high, stupendous as they are, they must be considered no more than an offshoot from the main cataract. Over this magnificent precipice it is said the irresistible tide rushes at the rate of a hundred million tons of water every hour! Niagara, according to the testimony of all who dwell near it, is never more beautiful than in the cold midwinter, when no tourists visit it, and when the sides of the chasm are corrugated and adorned with pillars and stalactites of silvery frost; and when huge blocks of ice from Lake Erie, weighing hundreds of tons, are hurled down the Rapids and over the Falls, as if they were of no greater specific gravity than feathers or human bodies, and reappear half a mile lower down the river, shivered to numberless fragments. It is a tradition of Niagara that, in 1822 or 1823, such a thick wall of ice was formed above Goat Island that no water flowed past for several hours, and that in the interval the precipice at the Horse Shoe Fall was perfectly bare and dry. A picture of the scene, painted at the time, is still in existence.",61-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contains a population of 75,000. It is not only a beautiful but a solidly-built city, and wears a general air and aspect of strength befitting the climate. By the French Roman Catholics, who form nearly one half of the population, it is called affectionately the Ville Marie, or town of the Virgin Mary; the names of its principal streets, derived from those of the Saints in the Romish Calendar, testify alike to the fervency and to the faith of its founders. The quays of Montreal are unsurpassed by those of any city in America; built of solid limestone, and uniting with the locks and cut stone wharves of the Lachine Canal, they display for several miles a mass of continuous masonry. Unlike the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi, no unsightly warehouses disfigure the river side. A broad terrace, faced with gray limestone, the parapets of which are surmounted with a substantial iron railing, divides the city from the river throughout its whole length. Amongst the public buildings, the most remarkable is the Roman Catholic Cathedral; of the vastness of the interior of this edifice, an idea may be formed from the fact that it is capable of accommodating nearly 12,000 persons. The view from the summit of its towers, one of which I ascended embracing the city and its suburbs, the river, and the surrounding country—is exceedingly beautiful. Other elegant public edifices claim the attention of the visitor, also numerous banks, nunneries, and churches: all of these buildings are erected in a most durable manner.",71-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everybody who has seen or read of Quebec must remember the magnificent towering rock overhanging the river, on the summit of which the citadel is placed, forming at once the chief stronghold of its defence, and the grandest feature of its scenery. The city is divided into two sections, called the Upper and the Lower Towns; the Upper Town occupying the highest part of the promontory, which is surrounded by strong walls and other fortifications; and the Lower Town, being built around the base of Cape Diamond. The latter is the business quarter. I had not been many hours in Quebec before I stood at the wall of the citadel, overlooking the river from a dizzy height of 300 feet—the standard of Great Britain floating over my head; the red-coated soldiers of my native land pacing their rounds, and suggesting, by their general appearance, the dear old country, from which I was separated by so many thousand miles of ocean; and on the soil of whose noble colony I stood, and felt that I was no longer a “foreigner”, as I was sometimes reminded when in the United States. The Citadel with its numerous buildings covers about 40 acres; its impregnable position makes it perhaps the strongest fortresa on the American Continent. The view from the citadel is most lovely, taking in, as it does, the opposite banks of the great river for nearly 50 miles up and down. I heard it said, that a gentleman once remarked, that the only scene he knew more glorious than that which meets the eye from the citadel at Quebec was Rio Janeiro, which he believed to be by far the grandest in the world; but the Rio lacks the associations of Quebec. Who could forget that beneath its walls two chieftains, the bravest of the brave, fell on the same battle field.",75-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/22603/22603.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
