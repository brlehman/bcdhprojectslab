The fault of it is that it is too large. Nearly one-fifth of the population of Argentina is to be found condensed in Buenos Aires, and much of it is urgently wanted elsewhere. It has survived all the vicissitudes of early colonization, and lived to complete in another half its destiny as the most magnificent and ""up to date"" of all the cities of South America. It is not a new growth, an upstart, liek many of the mushroom cities of North America. It possesses a history and the respectability which belongs of right to a town owning stirring traditions lasting through centuries. As a town, it belongs to a fine old worl aristocracy, and the same air which pervades Rio de Janeiro is perceptible in Buenos Aires, undestroyed, uncontaminated even, by the busy chaos of telephone wires, electric tram constructions, and other accessories of modern civilization which enclose it as an iron network.","69, 70",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the rising slopes which border the foothills, between stony unprofitable shelves of detritus and a scanty scrub of salt bush and acacia (growing scantier with the rise of the country), the rail runs easily. It might be a tract in the Baluch lowlands, or in the South African Karoo that we pass over-but for the frequent cactus. As we rise higher the hills grow to greatness, the landscape becomes variegated in colour, marbled on the hill-side with splashes of pink where the granite outcrop occurs, and powdery white about the lower slopes. But the prevailing tint is red. Bush there is little or none, but the feathery pampas grass fits itself into cracks and clefts, advertising its existence with waving plumes ; Farther up the line, where it twists in and out of frequent gullies, and breaks into ladder-rail to lift it over steeper grades, the walls of the valley approach each other. The river, smaller and swifter, and no longer meandering from side to side of the flat bottom of a slabsided canon, becomes white with the milky outflow of the glacier, and the stone-strewn sides of the slopes above it stand at steep angles. Now and then a perfect fan, smoothed and rounded, radiates out from a crack in the mountains, and down its steepest slope (just where the water-parting should be) is cut the water-course, defying all ordinary problems of gravitation and offering despair to the topographer. On the whole, I must confess to disappointment with my first view of the Andes. I did not expect Himalayan scenery, but I did expect something of the softer charm which radiates everlastingly from the pine-clad summits of the European Alps.","143, 144",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the dignified old Emperor Pedro stepped down from his throne to make way for the republic, Brazil has retrograded step by step. This is frankly admitted by Brazilians themselves, although they would not have the Empire back with magmficent possessions of as vet undeveloped natural resources, and a rich heritage of splendid possibilities, the material prosperity, the credit, and the respectability of Brazil has rather diminished than increased. Some of these national assests departed with the Empire, and Rio de Janeiro bears witness to a general downward tendency. It is written largely and plainly all over its dilapitated palaces and evil-smelling boulevards.","68, 69",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difficulty of access is often quoted as a guarantee for the security of the town in case of war. It would be impossible to bombard Buenos Aires from any point attainable by ships of sufficient capacity to effect a bombardment. But military safety hardly compensates for commercial inconvenience. [...] The approach to Buenos Aires from the sea after leaving the coast port of Monte Video is up the broad estuary of the La Plata-- an estuary so broad that land cannot be distinguished on the horizon of its wide red shimmering surface.

A modern writer has described it as ""a city of palaces, plazas, avenues and parks."" It is better designed and better lighted and embellished even than Buenos Aires. Ten million sterling are said to have been spent over La Plata without touching the port. But it has no trade or industry of its own. No busy traffic fills its wide, grass grown, deserted streets.

Here on a Sunday morning a great part of Buenos Aires society loses itself. There are yacht clubs and rowing clubs, and every species of waterside amusement at the end of the 21 mile run by rail from the city, and there is enough space in the woods and gardens of the delta to absorb the whole pleasure-loving population of the city. Within memory of living people this delta was covered by forest and undergrowth thick enough to contain the lairs of the spotted jaguar of South America, which has left its name to the river but is no more to be found in its neighborhood. This is the fruit-growing suburb of the town. Miles upon miles of peach trees, mixed with figs and other fruit, extend in lines along the banks of the streams and canals, well-tended and cared for, and teh amount of fruit that is thrown upon the market from the delta country must be often in excess of the demand, even in this fruit-eating centre. The surface of the river is occasionally covered with the floating debris of the market gardens. A curious population has sprung up in the delta, which, I am told, is an admixture of Basque, Spaniard, and Italian, speaking Spanish and living an easy, indolent life in a sort of Eden which requires but little delving. They are a cheery, good-looking people, bright, intelligent, and contented, taking no great interest in politics, and indifferent to the revolutionary agitaions which occasionally rage around them. The richness of the delta alluvium extends to the districts which border it. It is on Las Palmas that the most productive grazing land in Buenos Aires providence is to be found. It is here that it is possible to put sixty sheep to an acre of grass (one hardly likes to write it down!), and these sixty sheep will live on that same acre all the year round. Cattle raising and agriculture are the backbones of the Argentine industry; the future of the country mostly depends on them.

Something of the Old World custom of separating women from men in large assemblies seems still to prevail in South America. At any rate I observed that the women love to place themselves in artistic rows (there is, by the way, one gallery reserved for women only), and admit of no ugly black and white blotches of male attire to interfere with the harmony of their perfect colour arrangements. It almost appears as if each individual unit dressed with a view to the effect of the whole company. And the total effect is brilliant, harmonious, and infinitely delicate and pleasing in colour expression.

More than a mile in width, and with a fall of over 200 feet, the whole volume of the river thunders down in a double cascade, sending up thick clouds of spray amidst the dense vegetation of a sub-tropical forest. The attraction of such scenery will tend rapidly to the development of the Misiones territory. Already the great landscape gardener of Buenos Aires, M. Thays, has taken the approaches to the falls in hand. A road of twelve or thirteen miles has been cut through the virgin forest, and every point of view which can give new interest to this magnificent spectacle will be made available.

Mendoza is not the Mendoza of Spanish foundation in 1561. That lasted 300 years, and was completely destroyed by earthquake in 1861. [...] The present Mendoza is new, and looks it. the streets appear unfinished and teh houses stand in irregular and uneven rows on either side of them. the long avenue of the central boulevard has none of the grace of mature age, and the by-ways are but incomplete and muddy tracks, leading ti unknown surroundings.
 
 The ""Bodegas,"" or wine making establishments of Mendoza, are its most attractive feature. A short drive from the station took us to one or two of the principal bodegas, which appear to carry on a large and successful trade in the peculiar wine of the country. It is a rough produce, and it never travels far. [...] There was one feature in the vineyards, noticeable by reason of its peculiarity. In the centre of each large field, an instrument which looked like a huge funnel or blunderbuss, was set up endways with its wide mouth pointing to the sky. It was, indeed, a blunderbuss of a special pattern, adapted for firing blank charges at thunderclouds in order to avert the plague of hail. Hail works destruction in vineyards all the world over; but it appears to be only in Italy and at Mendoza that this system of precipitating rain (and thus forestalling hail) is adopted.","139, 140",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the four batteries filed along teh boulevard under the chequered shadow of the trees they looked smart and servicable, well equipped, and well found both in men and mules. The men were distinctly above the average Argentine in physique, and some of teh mules were splendid animals. they form a new feature in the Argentine service, and it is certainly remarkable how soon both men and animals have been trained into all the outward appearance of smartness. [...] The uniform of light blue and white was perhaps a litte gay for artillery, but it was most effective for parade purposes. The batteries were brought into action just under the hills outside Mendoza. there was no hitch in the proceedings such as might have been expected with recruits so recently trained to the role of gunners, and the shooting appeared to be straight and effective. It would almost seem as if gunners, equally with cavalry, are ""born, not made,"" in Argentina.
 
 Naturally one expected to hear from the military officials of Argentina some expression of dissapointment at the prospect of peace after such elaborate and expensive preporations for war had been completed ; and undoubtedly the disappointment existed, but it was unexpressed. There was throughout the service a spirit of self-contained reserve in speaking of the chances of war which impressed me greatly.","141, 142",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a very fairly comfortable hotel here, but the place and the hotel have already be left behind by the railway, which now reaches to Las Cuevas, just under the smooth slopes which entail the final struggle to the windy summit of the pass. When we passed that way in 1902, a night at the hotel and a drive in the very early hours of the morning was a necessity of the situation. The early drive was cold, and the party packed into the wagonette (drawn by four mules abreast) was too cold to be interested in the surroundings.

It was all impressive, because it was so new, and so unlike anything that I had seen before. There was a certain familiarity about a rope bridge, across (or along) which an old woman was hauling herself slowly as she sat in the pendent wire loop.

Plantations have been formed near Talcahuano. There is, nevertheless, quite a large variety of useful timber from the southern forest already in the wood market, and so much demand has already been made on the best and most useful classes of wood, that large areas near the coast (notably, near Puerto Montt) have been denuded of much magnificent timber without any attempt at replacing it by plantation, or hope of preserving it by any system of conservancy. It was a reckless disregard of all ordinary laws of forestry which permitted the destruction of teh splendid growth of the alerce (Fitzroya Patagonica) near Puerto Montt. The ragged and weather-worn stumps which remain are witnesses to the splendid size of the trees and the ruthless nature of their destruction. there is not a good tree left. Fortunately, the best timber is at present found in positions more remote from the coast. Alerce and cypress are valuable whenever they are found, and it may happen that with the growth of the means of access to the upper valleys of teh Andes, where they chiefly exist at present, will come a growth of appreciation of the necessity for forest reservations, and forest nurseries.","196, 197",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Intendente, or Governor, of the town rightly judged that the best he could offer to the stranger was a view of Concepcion from the hills above; so, after disposing of the inevitable reception (and the invariable but trying ordeal by champagne), we rode out of the quaint old plaza, across the poplar avenue (more stately and yet more blessed in the grace of its surroundings than the poplar avenue of Islamabad in Kashmir) , and up the steep red slopes of the hills to where we might watch the Bio-Bio interlacing the plains (threaded with poplar and now blue with the shimmer of autumn haze), and curling itself lazily to the lip of the sea. It was a typical view of Central Chile. The town of Concepcion (square built, with straight streets intersecting) packed its white houses round the central Plaza, and extended broken arms out into the yellow plains beyond. On one side of it were the sunlit hills, red and purple, with dark blotches of broken forest; and we stood on an outlying spur of them looking a cross the town and over the river to the shining sea. Below us was the Bio-Bio bridge, which is 1,889 metres in length and was opened in the year of grace 1889- so we were told. It wore an unsubstantial look because its girders rested on trestles with no apparent abutments, or protecting piers, to break the force of what is at times an unruly river. It looked just a narrow ribbon of communication between the town and the port of Talcahuano.
 
 In every town of Chile the banks seem to occupy the best sites and to rise to the greatest architectural magnificence. So it is in Concepcion.

The ores (carbonates and sulphates) are brought down from California in ships, and here undergo a succession of refining processes.
 
 But memories of Lota are entwined with other visions than those of roaring furnaces and vast mountains of unutilised slag. There was a garden above Lota, on the cliffs overlooking the bay, which had been laid out by a Chilean lady, who, determined to redeem the black ugliness of the coal fields from which she derived her fortune by following the suggestions of artistic fancy, devoted the declining years of her life to landscape gardening. Nothing repays the artist in Chile like the development of its natural beauty in landscape form. For miles one might wander through the lovely leafy avenues of these gardens, turning occasionally into open spaces where fountains and statues broke the chequered lights, or where masses of flowers piled themselves in banks and beds against the velvet slopes of cultured turf and never lose sight altogether of the glitter of the western sea as it faded in hazy distance to meet the sunset.","199, 200",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cold and grey and misty was the usual condition of the atmosphere, but neither greyness nor mist could much affect the weird beauty of the endless procession of th e mountain scenery through which we glided and slid [...] Forest was everywhere about us, dense, shadowy, dark, and generally dripping. The long lines of the higher sierra were thick with it up to the point where the granite cliffs, polished and smoothed by ice-cap and glacier, gave foothold to vegetation only on their flat ledges. The little islets, that seemed to chase one another through the streaky grey sea, were rounded and packed with it [...] Sometimes there would come a break in the hills. Then one looked up the long blue vista of a valley, counting fold upon fold and spur upon spur, ever growing bluer and fainter in the distance, till a gleam of white shimmering light showed where the glacier lay at the end. Sometimes another inlet twisted out of the main course, running so deep into the heart of the hills that the head of it was lost to view. But the glacier made itself felt in the cold touch of the icy air which breathed from its mouth, and in the countless little white icebergs that tumbled along one after another round the curves of the inlet shore out into the open. Although it was difficult to imagine that anything so wet and so dripping as that prirmeval forest could ever make an effective blaze, still there were unmistakeable evidences of vast forest fires at intervals.","202, 205, 206",,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/countriesofking00hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we could climb along with difficulty; but the leaving of the hard rocks of the shore, and the thrusting of one's body into the close set jungle of undergrowth was a process much more difficult. The countless masses of growing things, and the rotten substratum of things that had done growing, made a most insecure footing. The deep spongy moss let one in knee deep even when it covered a hard rocky surface. When it merely hid a slimy mass of interlaced and rotten tree trunks there was no known depth to which one might not descend. It would be easy enough for a man to disappear bodily (as in an Irish bog) whilst still wandering under the shade of those forest trees. The result is that no living four-footed creature is to be found in Patagonian jungles near the sea; and sport, as known to the British sportsman, does not exist [...] Thick as is t h forest growth there is nothing on the islands which can be called good timber. A few ""canoe"" Indians find there home in these still waters, punting from one small bay to another, and subsisting on the mussels (choros) and sea eggs which cluster thick on the rocky edges of the land. Immense ""middens,"" or mounds of cast-away shells, testify to a far more extensive Indian occupation than now exists, and all nautical wanderers through these by-ways of the sea speak of the rapid diminuation of the ancient coast tribes.
