This city is inhabited by Moors, and a very extensive traffic is carried on there.

We found that pepper and ginger grew here. The pepper trees are similar to the ivy, because they grow round other trees wherever they can attach themselves; their leaves resemble those of the ivy. Their bunches are of the length of half a palm or more, and as slender as a finger : the grain grows very thickly around. The reason why pepper does not grow in our region is, that we have none of the trees to plant. It is not true, as reported amongst us, that the pepper is scorched in order that it may not grow. When it is ripe and gathered in it is green, like ivy ; it is left to dry in the sun, and in five or six days it becomes black and wrinkled as we see it. For the propagation of ginger they plant a piece of a small fresh root, about the size of a small nut, which at the end of a month grows large: the leaf resembles that of the wild lily. 
 
 The lord of the city is an idolater, likewise are all the people. They worship an ox, or the sun, and also various idols, which they themselves make. When these people die they are burnt: their customs and usages are various ; inasmuch as some kill all kinds of animals excepting oxen and cows: if any one were to kill or wound these, he would be himself immediately slain, because, as I have before said, they are objects of worship. Others, again, never eat flesh or fish, or anything that has had life. Every lady may take to herself seven or eight husbands, according to her inclination. The men never marry any woman who is a virgin; but if one, being a virgin, is betrothed, she is delivered over before the nuptials to some other person for fifteen or twenty days in order that she may be deflowered. In this city there are as many as a thousand houses inhabited by Christians, and the district is called Upper India.",4,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This part is called Lower India. Here is a great lord, who possesses more than ten thousand elephants, and every year he breeds five hundred of them. 
 
 This country is distant fifteen days' journey by land from another, called Ava, in which grow rubies and many other precious stones. Our wish was to go to this place, but at that time the two princes were at war, so that
 no one was allowed to go from the one place to the other. 
 
 Thus we were compelled to sell the merchandise which we had in the said city of Pegu, which were of such a sort that only the lord of the city could purchase them. He is an idolator, like the before-mentioned. To him, therefore, we sold them. The price amounted to two thousand ducats, and as
 we wished to be paid we were compelled, by reason of the troubles and intrigues occasioned by the aforesaid war, to remain there a year and a half, all which time we had daily to solicit at the house of the said lord. While we were thus suffering from cold and from heat, with many fatigues and hardships, Messer Hieronimo Adorno, who was a man of feeble constitution, and greatly reduced by these afflictions combined with an ancient malady which tried him sorely, after fiftyfive days' suffering, during which he had neither physician nor medicine, yielded up his spirit to our Lord God. This was at night, on the twenty-seventh day of December, St. John's day, in the year fourteen hundred and ninety-six.
 
 Although the sacraments of the church could not be administered to him, as there was no priest among us, nevertheless, such was his patience and contrition, that I am sure, judging from the excellent life which he had always led, that our Lord God will have received his soul into paradise, and to that effect have I prayed and continually do pray. His body was buried in a certain ruined church, frequented by none; and I declare to you, that for many months I was so grieved and afflicted by his death, that it was a great chance I had not followed him ; but afterwards, considering that the grief which had taken such hold of me could bring no remedy, and being consoled by some men of worth, I exerted myself to recover our property.",6,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It pleased the Lord God that I was able to lay hold of a large plank of wood, on which I floated at the mercy of the waters from morning till evening, when, as it pleased the divine mercy, three ships which had parted from our company and had been five miles in advance of us, learning our disaster, immediately sent out their boats, which came and took in those men who remained alive, of whom I was one, and we were divided amongst them according to their pleasure, and thus I arrived in one of the said ships at Cambay, the chief of which is a Mahometan, and a great lord.
