 By whom this New Plymouth (situated, according to Captain Jones his computation, in 41 degrees and 48 minutes) is now presently inhabited, your Lordship and the honorable Company do know better than myself. For whom how favourably God’s providence in thought and in deed, quite besides any plot or design of theirs, hath wrought, especially in the beginning of their enterprise, is worthy to be observed. For when, as your Lordship knows, their voyage was intended for Virginia, being by letters from Sir Edwin Sandys and Mr. Deputy Ferrar recommended to Sir Yeardley (then Governor) that he should give them the best advice he could for trading in Hudson’s River, whether it were by contrariety of wind or by the backwardness of their master or pilot to make (as they thought it) too long a journey, they fell short both of the one and the other, arriving first at that stately harbour called Cape Cod, called by Indians “Pamet”; from whence in shallop the pilot, a more forward undertaker than performer, promised to bring them to be seated in a pleasant and fertile place called Anquam, situate within Cape Ann, about forty leagues from Plymouth. After some dangerous and almost incurable errors and mistakings, he stumbled by accident upon the harbour of Plymouth; where, after the planters had failed of their intention, and the pilot of his, it pleased Almighty God (who had better provided for them than their own hearts could imagine) to plant them on the seat of an old town which divers [years] before had been abandoned of the Indians. So they both quietly and justly sate down without either dispossessing any of the natives, or being resisted by them, and without shedding so much as one drop of blood. Which felicity of theirs is confirmed unto them even by the voices of the savages themselves, who generally do acknowledge not only the seat, but the whole seigniory thereto belonging, to be, and do themselves disclaim all title from it; so that the right of those planters to it is altogether unquestionable—a favor which, since the first discovery of America, God hath not vouchsafed, so far as ever I could learn, upon any Christian nation within that continent. Yet can it not be denied but that these of the Summer Islands are blessed with the same privilege according to the saying of St. Paul, “If the firstfruits be holy, the lump is also holy.”",5,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the harbour is not only pleasant for air and prospect, but most sure for shipping, both small and great, being land-locked on all sides. The town is seated on the ascent of a hill, which besides the pleasure of variable objects entertaining the unsatisfied eye, such is the wholesomeness of the place (as the Governor told me) that for the space of one whole year of the two wherein they had been there, died not one man, woman or child.",6-7,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the east and north of this place is found as great plenty as to the south and west. Now whether there be any cod or no to the south of the place (as the Company[43] desire to be informed), although Mr. Vengham,[44] a man of experience in those parts, do seem to doubt. Yet a Flemish pilot, who is to 15 conduct Captain Argall his pinnace into Hudson’s River, putteth down in his plot a place some fifteen leagues to the west of Elizabeth’s Island, which he calleth Cod Island.",14-15,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, to the south of Hudson’s River, they name the country “Aquahanacke.”",15,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Besides that plantation of New Plymouth in 41 degrees and one half, and that other in Massachusetts in 42 or thereabouts, there is a third in Canada at Damerill’s Cove in 43 and 45 minutes, at the cost of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, consisting of some thirteen persons, who are to provide fish all the year with a couple of shallops for the most timely loading of a ship, and to keep that island to be farmed out in Sir Ferninando’s name to such as shall there fish. And lest the French or the savages should 16 root them out in winter, they have fortified themselves with a strong palisado of spruce trees of some ten foot high, having besides their small shot one piece of ordnance and some ten good dogs.",15-16,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Now, as concerning the soil, it is all along, as far as I could perceive, rocky, rough and uneven; and, that as I hear, from a little on this side [of] Cape Cod as far as to Newfoundland, being all along the sea coast a labyrinth of innumerable islands or broken lands rent in sunder by intricate channels, rivers and arms of the sea. Upon these rocky grounds do grow naturally fir, spruce, birch and other trees, and in some open places abundance of rasps, gooseberries, hurts and such fruit; in other places, high rank grass for the grazing of cattle, to make hay withal; as likewise, great plenty of pease like our English pease, growing naturally without any tilth. Upon these rocky places, there is passing good soil, yet culturable with hoe and spade rather than with the plow. Yet they say that up the river Prinaquie there is a place of even champian country without any 17 rocks, abounding with variety of excellent timber, and like at Anquam nearer unto Cape Ann, a level of more beauty and largeness.
 
 Within an infinity of rocks may be intombed abundance of rich minerals, among which silver and copper are supposed to be the chief. Out of these rocks do gush out delicate streams of water which, together with the temper of the air, maketh this place marvelous wholesome in summer—which is the cause I have not known one man sick all the time I was there, save only that villain which accused you falsely concerning Swabber, and died (aboard the Bona Nova) as he had lived, frantic.[59] Yet is the air too cold here for the summer, but with an easterly wind subject to fogs and mists.",16-17,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66135/66135-h/66135-h.htm#fr_161,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
