  Persons of all religions, and even idolators, are found in great numbers in this city, and no injustice is permitted towards any person whatever. This city is also named Dâralaman (the abode of security). The inhabitants unite the flattering character of the people of Irak with the profound cunning of the Indians.
 
  I sojourned in this place for the space of two months; and the governors sought all kinds of pretexts to detain me; so that the favorable time for departing by sea, that is to say the beginning or middle of the monsoon, was allowed to pass, and we came to the end of the monsoon, which is the season when tempests and attacks from pirates are to be dreaded. Then they gave me permission to depart. As the men and horses could not all be contained in the same vessel, they were distributed among several ships.

(It contains a considerable number of Mussulmauns, who are constant residents, and have built two mosques, in which they meet every Friday to offer up prayer. They have one Kadi, a priest, and for the most part they belong to the sect of Schafei. Security and justice are so firmly established in this city, that the most wealthy merchants bring thither from maritime countries considerable cargoes, which they unload, and unhesitatingly send into the markets and the bazaars, without thinking in the meantime of any necessity of checking the account or of keeping watch over the goods.
 
  The officers of the custom-house take upon themselves the charge of looking after the merchandise, over which they keep watch day and night. When a sale is effected, they levy a duty on the goods of one-fortieth part; if they are not sold, they make no charge on them whatsoever.
 
  In other ports a strange practice is adopted. When a vessel sets sail for a certain point, and suddenly is driven by a decree of Divine Providence into another roadstead, the inhabitants, under the pretext that the wind has driven it there, plunder the ship. But at Calicut, every ship, whatever place it may come from, or wherever it may be bound, when it puts into this port is treated like other vessels, and has no trouble of any kind to put up with.
 
  His majesty, the happy Khakan, had sent as a present for the prince of Calicut, some horses, some pelisses, some robes of cloth of gold, and some caps, similar to those distributed at the time of the Nauruz;. and the motive which had induced him to do so was as follows. Some ambassadors deputed by this monarch, returning from Bengal in company with the ambassadors of the latter country, having been obliged to put into Calicut, the description which they gave of the greatness and power of the Khakan reached the ears of the sovereign of that city. He learned from authentic testimony, that the kings of all the habitable globe, of the East as well as of the West, of the land and of the sea, had sent rival ambassadors and messages, showing that they regarded the august, court of that monarch as the Kiblah, to which they should pay their homage, -as the Kabah, the object to which they should direct their aspirations.

Having communicated my dream to some skilful men, I asked them its interpretation. On a sudden a man arrived, who brought me the intelligence that the king of Bidjanagar, who holds a powerful empire and a mighty dominion under his sway, had sent to the Sameri a delegate charged with a letter, in which he desired that he would send on to him the ambassador of his majesty, the happy Khakan. Although the Sameri is not subject to the laws of the king of Bidjanagar, he nevertheless pays him respect, and stands extremely in fear of him ; since, if what is said is true, this latter prince has in his dominions three hundred ports, each of which is equal to Calicut, and on terra firma his territories comprise a space of three months' journey. The coast, which includes Calicut with some other neighbouring ports, and which extends as far as Kabel, a place situated opposite the Island of Serendib, otherwise called Ceylon, bears the general name of Melibar. From Calicut are vessels continually sailing for Mecca, which are for the most part laden with pepper.
 
  The inhabitants of Calicut are adventurous sailors : they are known by the name of Tchini-betchegan (son of the Chinese), and pirates do not dare to attack the vessels of Calicut. In this harbour one may find everything that can be desired. One thing alone is forbidden, namely, to kill a cow, or to eat its flesh: whosoever should be discovered slaughtering or eating one of these animals, would be inimediately punished with death. So respected is the cow in these parts, that the inhabitants take its dung when dry and rub their foreheads with it.
 
  The humble author of this narrative having received his audience of dismissal, departed from Calicut by sea. After having passed the port of Bendinaneh, situated on the coast of Melibar, reached the port of Mangalor, which forms the frontier of the kingdom of Bidjanagar.",19-20,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067

 After staying there two or three days he continued his route by land. At a distance of three parasangs from Mangalor he saw a temple of idols, which has not its equal in the universe. It is an equilateral square, of about ten ghez in length, ten in breadth, and five in height. It is entirely formed of cast bronze. It has four estrades. Upon that in the front stands a human figure, of great size, made of gold ; its eyes are formed of two rubies, placed so artistically that the statue seems to look at you. The whole is worked with wonderful delicacy and perfection. After passing this temple, I came each day to some city or populous town.
 
  At length I came to a mountain whose summit reached the skies, and the foot of which was covered with so great a quantity of trees and thorny underwood, that the rays of the sun could never penetrate the obscurity, nor could the beneficial rains at any time reach the soil to moisten it.",20,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067

 Having left this mountain and this forest behind me, I reached a town called Belour, the houses of which were like palaces, and its women reminded one of the beauty of the Houris. In it there is a temple of idols, so lofty as to be visible at a distance of many parasangs. It would be impossible to describe such a building without being suspected of exaggeration. I can only give a general idea of it. In the middle of the town is an open space, of about ten ghez in extent, and which, if one may use a comparison, rivals the garden of Irem. The roses of all kinds are as numerous as the leaves of the trees, on the borders of the streams rise a great number of cypresses, whose towering height is reflected in the waters, plantain trees shoot out their tufted branches, and it would seem as if heaven itself looks down upon this beautiful spot with pleasure and admiration. All the ground of this parterre, all the environs of this place of delight, are paved with polished stones, joined together with so much delicacy and skill, that they seem to form but one single slab of stone, and look like a fragment of the sky which might be supposed to have been brought down to the earth. In the middle of this platform rises a building composed of a cupola formed of blue stones, and terminating in a point. The stone presents three rows of figures.
 
  What can I say of this cupola, which, as regards the delicacy of the work, offered to the world an idea of paradise ? Its vault, rounded and lofty, resembled a new moon ; its elevation vied with that of the heavens.
 
  So great a number of pictures and figures had been drawn by the pen and the pencil, that it would be impossible, in the space of a month, to sketch it all upon damask or taffeta.
 
  From the bottom of the building to the top there is not a hand's breadth to be found uncovered with paintings, after the manner of the Franks and the people of Khata (China). The temple consists of a structure of four estrades; this structure is thirty ghez in length, twenty in breadth, fifty in height.
  
 
 Since that its head shot up towards the skies, that vault, previously without stones in it, now seems formed of them.
 
  Since that its stones have rubbed themselves against the sun, the gold of that orb has taken a purer alloy.
 
  All the other buildings, great and small, are covered with paintings and sculptures of extreme delicacy. In this temple morning and evening, after devotional exercises, which have nothing in them which can be agreeable to God, they play on musical instruments, perform concerts, and give feasts. All the inhabitants of the town have rents and pensions assigned to them on this temple. The most distant cities send hither their alms. In the opinion of these men without religion, this place is the Kabah of the Guères.",20-22,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067

Richard Henry Major (London: Printed for the Hakluyt society, 1857)",London,Printed for the Hakluyt society,1857,Male,Afghanistan,Persian,English,1443-4,1443-11-05,,15th century,1440s,15.3413,76.46414,Bidjanagar,Ancient City of Vijayanagara at Hampi,India,Southern Asia,Asia,"After having sojourned in this town for the space of two or three days we continued our route, and at the end of the month of Zou'lhidjah [end of April] we arrived at the city of Bidjanagar. The king sent a numerous cortège to meet us, and appointed us a very handsome house for our residence.
 
  The preceding details, forming a close narrative of events, have shown to readers and writers that the chances of a maritime voyage had led Abd-er-Razzak, the author of this work, to the city of Bidjanagar. He saw a place extremely large and thickly peopled, and a king possessing greatness and sovereignty to the highest degree, whose dominion extends from the frontier of Serendib to the extremities of the country of Kalbergah. From the frontiers of Bengal to the environs of Belinar (Melibar), the distance is more than a thousand parasangs. The country is for the most part well cultivated, very fertile, and contains about three hundred harbours. One sees there more than a thousand elephants, in their size resembling mountains, and in their forms resembling devils. The troops amount in number to eleven lak (1,100,000). 
 
 One might seek in vain throughout the whole of Hindoostan to find a more absolute raï (king); for the monarchs of this country bear the title of raï. Next to him the Brahmins hold a rank superior to that of all other men. The book of Kalilah and Dimna, the most beautiful work existing in the Persian language, and which presents us with the stories of a raï and a Brahmin, is probably a production of the talent of the literati of this country.
 
  The city of Bidjanagar is such that the pupil of the eye has never seen a place like it, and the ear of intelligence has never been informed that there existed anything to equal it in the world. It is built in such a manner that seven citadels and the same number of walls enclose each other. Around the first citadel are stones of the height of a man, one half of which is sunk in the ground while the other rises above it.
 
  These are fixed one beside the other, in such a manner that no horse or foot soldier could boldly or with ease approach the citadel. If any one would wish to find what point of resemblance this fortress and rampart present with that which exists in the city of Herat, let him picture to himself that the first citadel corresponds with that which extends from the mountain of Mokhtar and Direh dou Buraderim (the Valley of the Two Brothers) as far as the banks of the river and the bridge of Malan, situated east of the town of Ghinan, and west of the village of Saïban.
 
  It is a fortress of a round shape, built on the summit of a mountain, and constructed of stones and lime. It has very solid gates, the guards of which are constantly at their post, and examine everything with a severe inspection.
 
  The second fortress represents the space which extends from the bridge of the new river, to the bridge of the Karav, lying to the east of the bridge of Renghineh and Djakan, and to the west of the garden of Zibendeh and of the village of Hasan.
 
  The third citadel comprises as much space as lies between the mausoleum of the Imaum Fakhr-eddin-Râzi and the dome-shaped monument of Mohammed-Sultan-Schah.
 
  The fourth correspends to the space which separates the bridge Andjil from the bridge of Kâred.
 
  The fifth comprises a space equal to that which extends from the garden of Zagan to the bridge of Andjegan.
 
  The sixth is equivalent to the space contained between the King's gate and the gate of Firouz-abad.
 
  The seventh fortress, which is placed in the centre of the others, occupies an area ten times larger than the marketplace of the city of Herat. It is the palace which is used as the residence of the king. The distance from the gate of the first fortress, which lies on the north, to the first gate, which is situated in the south, is calculated to be two parasangs. It is the same distance from the east to the west.
 
  The space which separates the first fortress from the second, and up to the third fortress, is filled with cultivated fields, and with houses and gardens. In the space from the third che seventh one meets a numberless crowd of people, many shops, and a bazaar. At the gate of the king's palace are four bazaars, placed opposite each other. On the north is the portico of the palace of the raï. Above each bazaar is a lofty arcade with a magnificent gallery, but the audience hall of the king's palace is elevated above all the rest. The bazaars are extremely long and broad. The rose merchants place before their shops high estrades, on each side of which they expose their flowers for sale. In this place one sees a constant succession of sweet smelling and fresh looking roses.
 
  These people could not live without roses, and they look upon them as quite as necessary as food.
 
  Each class of men belonging to each profession has shops contiguous the one to the other; the jewellers sell publicly in the bazaar pearls, rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. In this agreeable locality, as well as in the king's palace, one sees numerous running streams and canals formed of chiselled to stone, polished and smooth. On the left of the Sultan's portico rises the divan-khaneh (the council-house), which is extremely large and looks like a palace. In front of it is a hall, the height of which is above the stature of a man, its length thirty ghez, and its breadth ten. In it is placed the defter-khaneh (the archives), and here sit the scribes.
  The writing of this people is of two kinds : in one they write their letters with a kalam of iron upon a leaf of the Indian nut (the cocoa-nut tree), which is two ghez in length and two fingers in breadth. These characters have no colour, and the writing lasts but a short time. In the second kind of writing they blacken a white surface, they then take a soft stone, which they cut like a kalam,' and which they use to form the letters ; this stone leaves on the black surface a white colour, which lasts a very long time, and this kind of writing is held in high estimation.
 
  In the middle of this palace, upon an high estrade, is seated an eunuch, called Daiang, who alone presides over the divan. At the end of the hall stand tchobdar (hussars) drawn up in line. Every man who comes upon any business, passes between the tchobdar, offers a small present, prostrates himself with his face to the ground, then rising up explains the business which brought him there, and the Daiang pronounces his opinion, according to the principles of justice adopted in this kingdom, and no one thereafter is allowed to make any appeal.
 
  When the Daiang leaves the divan they carry before him several parasols of different colours, and sound a trumpet.
 
  On each side of him walk panegyrists, who pronounce complimentary expressions in his honour. Before reaching the king's apartment there are seven doors to be passed, each of which is guarded by a janitor. When the Daiang arrives at each door a parasol is unfolded. He passes through the seventh door alone, gives the prince an account of what matters are going on, and after the lapse of a few minutes retires. Behind the king's palace are the house and hall allotted to the Daiang. To the left of the said palace is the darab-khaneh (the mint). In this country they have three kinds of money, made of gold mixed with alloy : one called varahah weighs about one mithkal, equivalent to two dinars, kopeki ; the second, which is called pertab, is the half of the first; the third, called fanom, is equivalent in value to the tenth part of the last-mentioned coin. Of these different coins the fanom is the most useful. They cast in pure silver a coin which is the sixth of the fanom, which they call tar.
 
  This latter is also a very useful coin in currency. A copper coin worth the third of a tar, is called djitel. According to the practice adopted in this empire, all the provinces, at a fixed period, bring their gold to the mint. If any man receive from the divan an allowance in gold, he has to be paid by the darab-khaneh. The soldiers receive their pay every four months, and no payment is ever made by a draft upon the revenues of any province.
 
  This empire contains so great a population that it would be impossible to give an idea of it without entering into the most extensive details. In the king's palace are several cells, like basins, filled with bullion, forming one mass. All the inhabitants of this country, both those of exalted rank and of an inferior class, down to the artizans of the bazaar, wear pearls, or rings adorned with precious stones, in their ears, on their necks, on their arms, on the upper part of the hand, and on the fingers. Opposite the Divan - Khâneh (the palace of the council) is the Fil-Khâneh (the house of the elephants).
 
  Although the king possesses a considerable number of elephants in his dominions, the largest of these animals are kept near the palace, in the interior of the first and second fortress, between the north and the west. These elephants copulate, and bring forth young. The king possesses one white elephant of an extremely great size, on whose body are scattered here and there grey spots like freckles. Every morning this animal is led out before the monarch, and the sight of him seems to act as a happy omen.
 
 [Text goes on about elephants...]
 
  Opposite the darab-khaneh (the mint) is the house of the Governor, where are stationed twelve thousand soldiers as a guard, who receive every day a payment of twelve thousand fanom, levied on the receipts of the houses of prostitution.
 
  The magnificence of the places of this kind, the beauty of the young girls collected therein, their allurements, and their coquetry, surpass all description. I will confine myself to the description of some particulars. Behind the darabkhaneh is a sort of bazaar, which is more than three hundred ghez in length, and more than twenty in breadth. On two sides are ranged chambers and estrades ; in front of them are erected, in the form of thrones, several platforms constructed of beautiful stones. On the two sides of the avenue formed by the chambers are represented figures of lions, panthers, tigers, and other animals. All are so well drawn, and their movements have so natural an appearance, that you would think these animals were alive. Immediately after mid-day prayer they place before the doors of the chambers, which are decorated with extreme magnificence, thrones and chairs, on which the courtezans seat themselves.
 
  Each of these women is bedecked with pearls and gems of great value, and is dressed in costly raiment. They are extremely young, and of perfect beauty. Each one of them has by her two young slaves, who give the signal of pleasure, and have the charge of attending to everything which can contribute to amusement. Any man may enter into this locality, and select any girl that pleases him, and take his pleasure with her. Anything that he carries about with him is delivered into the keeping of those engaged in the service of the houses of prostitution ; and if anything is lost, these latter are responsible for it. 
 
 Each of the seven fortresses alike contains a great number of places of prostitution, and their general proceeds amount to twelve thousand fanom, which forms the pay allotted to the guards. These latter have it assigned to them as a duty to make themselves acquainted with every event which occurs within the fortresses ; if any article is lost or stolen by thieves it is their place to report it; if not they are bound to make it good. Some slaves which had been bought by my companions, had run away. Information was given of the circumstance to the governor, who gave orders to the superintendents of the quarter in which we lived to bring back the fugitives or to make good the loss. These guards, on being informed of the value of the slaves, paid up the amount.
 
  Such are the details which relate to the city of Bidjanagar and its sovereign.
 
  The author of this narrative, having arrived in this city at the end of the month of Zou'lhidjah [the end of April 1443] took up his abode in an extremely lofty house, which had been assigned to him, and which resembled that which one sees in the city of Herat, over the King's gate, which gate serves as a passage for the entire population. He rested himself for several days from the fatigues of his journey. It was on the first day of Moharrem [May 1st, 1443], that I took up my abode in this great city. One day some messengers sent from the palace of the king came to seek me, and at the close of that same day I presented myself at court, and offered for the monarch's acceptance five beautiful horses, and some tokouz of damask and satin. The prince was seated in a hall, surrounded by the most imposing attributes of state. Right and left of him stood a numerous crowd of men ranged in a circle. The king was dressed in a robe of green satin, around his neck he wore a collar, composed of pearls of beautiful water and other splendid gems.

While the vision of those ships which float over the mountain-like waves of the sea, presented to my thoughts the traces of the Divine power, the same time, in the conversation of the companions of my voyage, I collected observations respecting remarkable names and facts worthy of note, and throughout our little company peace and contentment prevailed.
 
  The eye of sad events and of misfortunes was gone to sleep, Fortune appeared to have given herself up to indolence, and we were surrounded with happiness.
 
  The ship, after a million of shocks, reached the open at sea.
 
  On a sudden there arose a violent wind on the surface of the sea, and on all sides were heard groaning and cries.
 
  The night, the vessel, the wind, and the gulf, presented to our minds all the forebodings of a catastrophe. On a sudden, through the effect of the contrary winds, which resembled men in their drink, the wine which produced this change penetrated even to the vessel. The planks of which it was composed, and which by their conformation seemed to form a continuous line, were on the point of becoming divided like the separate letters of the alphabet. To our thoughts was strikingly presented the truth of that passage : “ The waves cover it, the billow rises beneath it, and above it is the cloud.” The sailor who, with respect to his skill in swimming, might be compared to a fish, was anxious to throw himself into the water like an anchor. The captain, although familiarized with the navigation of all the seas, shed bitter tears, and had forgotten all his science. The sails were torn, the mast was entirely bent by the shock of the wind. The different grades of passengers who inhabited this floating house threw out upon the waves riches of great value, and, after the manner of the Sofis, voluntarily stripped themselves of their worldly goods. Who could give a thought to the jeopardy in which their money and their stuffs were placed, when life itself, which is so dear to man, was in danger ? For myself, in this situation, which brought before my eyes all the threatening terrors which the ocean had in its power to present, with tears in my eyes I gave myself up for lost.
 
  Through the effect of the stupor, and of the profound sadness to which I became a prey, I remained, like the sea, with my lips dry and my eyes moist, and resigned myself entirely to the Divine Will. At one time, through the driving of the waves, which resembled mountains, the vessel was lifted up to the skies ; at another, under the impulse of the violent winds, it descended like divers to the bottom of the waters.
 
  The agitation of the waters of the sea caused my body to melt like salt which is dissolved in water ; the violence of the deluge annihilated and utterly dispersed the firmness which sustained me, and my mind, hitherto so strong, was like the ice which is suddenly exposed to the heat of the month of Tamouz ; even now my heart is troubled and agitated, as is the fish which is taken out of fresh water.
 
  May the torrent of destruction overturn the edifice of fate, which thus brings in successive wares the waters of misfortune upon my head.
 
  Many times I said to myself, and it was in language dictated by my situation that I repeated, this verse : A dismal night! the fear of the waves, and so frightful an abyss ? What judgment can they who are so peaceful on shore form of our situation ? The pure water of my life was troubled by the agitation of the sea; and the brilliant mirror of my ideas, in consequence of the dampness of the water, and the putrefaction of the air, was covered with rust. Each moment that the pupils of my eyes contemplated that muddy water, it resembled, through the effect of my extreme alarm, a flaming sword.
 
  At the sight of the agitated sea, overset by the tempestuous winds, I drew from my breast an icy sigh ; it was a sharp weapon, which tore my very soul.
 
  Overwhelmed at every point, and seeing the gate of hope shut on every side against me, with an eye full of tears and a heart full of burning chagrin, I addressed myself to God with the expression of this verse : Oh, our Lord, place not upon us a burden which is too heavy for our strength to bear ? I prayed to the Being, who is supremely merciful, and who never upbraideth with his benefits, to be pleased, from the immense sea of His goodness, to bedew and to bestow fresh verdure upon the little shrub of my existence; and to deign, in the distribution of the water of His kindness, to wash completely and disperse from the face of my situation the dust which rendered my life a grievance to me.
 
  In the midst of this sad position, I reflected and put the question to myself: “ What, then, is this catastrophe, which has made fortune in her revolution fall so heavily upon me? 
 
 “ What, then, is this shame, which, through the hostility of a perfidious fate, of a base and contemptible destiny, has caused the serenity of my face to disappear ? On the one side, I have been unable to snatch my precious life from the fury of the waves of death, nor have I been able, in carrying out the business of my sovereign, to bring to the surface of the water the pearl of my exertions. For a generous soul neglects nothing which can tend to the fulfilment of the obligations which it has contracted towards its benefactor, and when it becomes a question of executing the business of its master, it regards life itself, which is ordinarily so precious, as utterly valueless. If the man of sincerity casts [his loyalty to] his king into the fire of events, his nature, like that of a gem, must show no alteration in the smallest atom ;
  or rather the gold of his loyalty, after the manner of pure gold, becomes still more refined.” I was in the midst of these reflections, and everything about me spoke of dejection and trouble, when at length, by virtue of that Divine promise: “ Who is He who hears the prayers of the afflicted, and drives away his misery ?” I on a sudden, the zephyr of God's infinite mercy began to blow upon me from that point which is indicated by these words: “ Despair not of the mercy of the Most High.” The morning of joy began to dawn from the East of happiness, and the messenger of a propitious fate brought to the ears of my soul these consolatory words: “ Since on your behalf we have divided the sea, we have saved you.” The impetuous hurricane was changed to a favourable wind, the tossing of the waves ceased, and the sea, in conformity with my desires, became completely calm. My fellow-passengers, after having celebrated at sea the feast of victims, gained sight, at the close of the month of Zu'lhidjah (middle of March, 1444) of the mountain of Kalahat, and found themselves at length in safety from all the perils of the deep. At this period, the new moon of the month of Moharrem, of the year 848 (middle of March 1444], like a beneficent spirit looked on us with a friendly eye.",45-49,,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067
