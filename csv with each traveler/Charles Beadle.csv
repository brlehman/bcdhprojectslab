The statue of Liberty stands on a little island facing the entrance, and then the two fine rivers which have New York between them branch off right and left; and they are fine rivers, and what is more, the tide rises and falls so little as compared with our coast, that the boats can be kept afloat alongside piers, and hence docks are unnecessary. Each company has its own landing stage, and really the water frontage has a most business-like appearance. The water is covered with steamers of all sizes. We got up in good time; after breakfast went down town, saw the public buildings and general character of New York. The Brooklyn Bridge is certainly the finest thing to be seen. It is, I should say, more than a mile long, has two lines of rail, two cart roads and a wide foot-passage over it, and is the best designed thing of the kind I have ever seen. Frank is writing a description of it, so I shall not. The peculiarities of New York, as far as I have yet seen them, are that the roads are bad, and the paved footpaths abominable. The telegraph poles quite spoil the appearance of the streets; they are not poles but large trees, and are stuck everywhere; and the overhead rails, although useful, must be the greatest possible nuisance to the people who occupy the houses they run past.
The houses and shops generally are not so fine as I had expected, but there are a few which I suppose are specimens of what will be seen in a few years—very fine indeed. In the overhead railways you pay 5 cents (2½d.) as you pass on to the platform, and get out where you like; there are stations about every quarter of a mile. The trains run without signals, and follow one another so quickly that they are never more than two minutes apart, and always seem to be full. They do not stay at a station more than half a minute at the outside. We have been in them several times to-day. For two or three hours in the morning and evening they run still more frequently.",13-15,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lunched at the hotel; afterwards, Mr. Albright, Mr. Barber's partner, and Mr. Warren, the manager, came round in Mr. Albright's carriage to take me for a drive round. The roads in the town are as bad as they can be. Those in the outskirts have many of them been paved with asphalte (Barber's), and are certainly very nicely done. The horses stand better on this asphalte than any other, and if it is as durable, it must come more into use. He also took me to look at Lake Erie, which is narrow at the Buffalo end. We looked at the coal-loading arrangements and the docks. Saw a very good system of feeding boilers to burn small coal and avoid smoke, of which I shall get full particulars. We then went to my son's house to tea, had some music, and returned to hotel to bed.

First part of the ride by rail was not very interesting, as the fields were bare, and there was little else to look at. Later on we came to a lot of woodland, where the trees had been allowed to blow down and rot, the old stumps remaining by thousands. There seems to be the greatest waste of timber and land about here, and everything is most untidy and desolate. As we neared Oil City we found traces of the oil wells, mostly, however, unused. Then came Oil City itself, a strange place —pumps put up everywhere, and large tanks to hold the oil. It seems that only a small pipe is put down to each well, and a little engine and a very rough pump put up. The oil is then conveyed in pipes to places where it is refined, and these places are owned by large companies, who buy the oil of the small men and control the market. There is considerable waste, and the river—which all along here, and in fact to Pittsburg, runs by the side of the line—is covered with it. The town of Oil City is rather an important place, and the centre of a considerable trade. Just after we left it we found the first indications of the natural gas, which was burning in several places to waste on the ground, not the least curious being a large flame from the top of the water in the middle of the river. The journey on to Pittsburg was a beautiful and interesting one, the banks along the river being high and well wooded. The oil wells have a scaffolding of timber not at all unsightly over each, and in many places there are small coal drops over the railway. Coal is found all along this district at a level of from 200 to 300 feet above the river; the seam is some six or seven feet thick and the coal good. As we neared our journey's end the symptoms of the presence of natural gas became greater. Villages were lit by it, common lamp-posts being placed at the corners of the streets, with a large torchlike flame to each burning day and night. We arrived about 7.30 at Pittsburg, put up at the Monongahela Hotel, which is large, and, like all the others we have been in, a kind of public meeting-place. We had very nice rooms given to us, and after supper had a look into the town. We went to bed tired....Pittsburg is most beautifully situated, and is a very fine city of nearly 300,000 inhabitants. The electric light is used more than gas in its streets and buildings, and is perfectly managable. There is a notice up in our hotel bedrooms that if gas is used it must be paid for as an extra; the electric lights, which we can turn on or off at pleasure, are free. The city is situated something like New York, being at the confluence of the Monongahela and Alleghany rivers. Both are very fine rivers and run something like 1,800 miles before their waters reach the sea. There is plenty of high ground round the city. We went to the top of one place on an inclined lift, and had a look at the city from a height of 400 feet.",26-28,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is very nice to have these messages; without them I should not know anything about home. They are all well, I am thankful to say. She wants to know whether I will stand as churchwarden at Belvedere. I have answered, will do what Belvedere friends think best. The meeting is, I suppose, to-morrow. Had a good look round Baltimore, which is a fine city and a large port. The streets are very well paved; the public buildings are large and good. Electric light everywhere. The shops, particularly the clothiers', large and gay. The climate altogether milder, although not far south of Buffalo. The one we left fast bound in ice, and find the other as warm as summer, with trees coming into leaf. Many river steamboats start from here. The water accommodation is splendid; something like Portsmouth, only much larger and further in from the sea. Tons of oysters are brought here; you can get them in any quantity at every meal. The shells are ground for chicken food or burned into lime. There was a woodcutting machine here for firewood, which would cut and split a cartload as fast as cart could be loaded. The hotel (Barnum's) was a very large and old-fashioned one, but not the most comfortable. We had splendid ice here. Ice making is a large business in the southern States; I should say it would pay in England. We started at 7.45, but left Frank's bag behind. I hope he will get it in the morning.",42-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I spent this morning in going to the British Legation to swear to some documents, and in writing to London with them, and several other letters, and afterwards had a walk round the streets near the hotel. After lunch we went to the Smithsonian Institution in the park, where there are some very interesting things, particularly the casts of sculpture from Mexico, which seem to be as ancient as the Egyptian, and very much like them; in fact, you cannot help suspecting that in very ancient times there must have been some communication between the two countries. The various dresses and arms of the Indian tribes might also be studied to advantage, and the animals found in different parts of the States, or rather on the American continent generally. The Department of Agriculture must be useful, as not only are the seeds and products exhibited, but samples of the earth from various parts of the world which grow crops of plants not yet introduced into the States. We also inspected the marble column erected, partly by subscription and partly by the Government, in memory of Washington. It is a plain obelisk, 60 feet square at the base and 555 feet high, and as far as I can see will not last long, as it is built entirely of marble and the bottom stones are being crushed by the great weight. After dinner we had a walk round the lighted streets before bed-time....We spent the afternoon in visiting the Capitol, which is really the Parliament house, and a very fine, sensible, useful building it is. Both the Upper and Lower Houses sit in large rectangular halls, where every word spoken can be heard easily; each member also has a desk or, I should say, a small writing-table before him. In one of the halls, formerly used by the representatives but now only as a lobby, there are some most extraordinary echoes— the most extraordinary I have ever heard.",43-46,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The flowers, azaleas and rhododendrons, were numerous, the former in full bloom, but no sign of bloom on the latter; thousands of wild flowers and very large creepers, such as you see in pictures of tropical forests. The rivers, of which we crossed many, are very pretty indeed, but I should say very unhealthy to live near. We reached Charleston at 3.30, and at once had a look round the town, as we could not eat anything. The town is situated, like most of these towns are, on a tongue of land between two rivers only five miles from the sea, and the harbour is as good as New York, and not unlike it, except that it is much smaller and there is very little going on. The houses all show the effects of the earthquake; the porticoes of the public buildings are most of them still in ruins. This hotel, the “Charleston Hotel,” is a large one, and cracked all over. They have stopped up the cracks in our bedroom, and there is almost as much crack as wall. The dining-room ceiling seems to have been all down except a small piece in the middle. They say the main shock only lasted four seconds; a minute at the same force would have levelled every place in the city. The people even now seem very nervous. A policeman told us he heard or felt a shock almost every night, but that orders had been given not to mention or publish it, so that the people might be quiet. They seem to have got low-spirited about this town. It was, they say, knocked to pieces in the time of the war; a year or two ago a whirlwind broke up everything; last year the earthquake did hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of damage, and most of the places will have to be patched up; and now they fear an inundation, as the town level is very low, and they seem to think it stands on a bad foundation. Our policeman said he hoped for more thunderstorms than they had had lately, as it was his opinion they would draw the electricity out of the earth and thus prevent earthquakes. There were little machines on the dinner tables to fan away the flies. The black population, I should say, vastly outnumber the whites about here. They are very obliging and seem to be happy and contented; some have nice manners, and all speak fair English. I am speaking of those in the towns. There is a considerable quantity of cotton shipped from here. There is also a trade in pitch-pine timber, but not so large as at Jacksonville. I bought some photos of the ruins of the town after the earthquake.",51-54,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First we took a tramcar and rode as far as it went into a pretty district, where there were some good residences and tastefully laidout gardens, green and well-kept lawns. We then got into a tram moved by a cable seven miles long. It has a large engine-house about midway to provide the motive power, and runs two cars together every few minutes, so that the power used must be very great, particularly as it winds round several corners and up and down hills. The outlay altogether must have been very considerable. It seems to work well, but I could not find out whether it was a paying concern. In the morning had another turn round city and along the water-side, and arranged for a start up the river on the following day. Saw Messrs. Warren & Co., Mr. Barber's friends, corner Fifth and Olive Streets, who were kind enough to give us some useful information. The river here seems to be as large a stream as it is at New Orleans, although it has between here and there lost several big tributaries; but I suppose it is not so deep. There is a very large business doing here, every one seems alive. The drygoods stores are numerous, and Cook's of St. Paul's Churchyard would not outdo some of them. The streets are well paved; electric light in common use; more telegraph, telephone, and electric power wires than in any other city we have yet seen. This is now a large place, and will soon get larger, as it is splendidly situated between the eastern and western States.",72-73,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country was altogether different from any we had seen—all good agricultural land, the first part in small farms well kept and nicely fenced, houses neat and tidy. As we got on, the fields were larger, and we could see we had struck the corn-producing districts; there were also many large fields with herds of cattle in them and some sheep. The towns and villages had a different appearance, and the people too, but all seem happy and satisfied, although they must work hard. A newsboy amused me this morning: on asking him whether he had a certain paper, he said, “Yes;” but after hunting through his packet he said he “guessed he had deviated,” being his way of acknowledging he had not told the truth. The horses are all small, but nicely bred. The land is a dark rich soil; I should think it would produce several crops without much manure. The town of Kansas City has plenty of life in it; we shall see more of it tomorrow. I am glad to say I have letters from home up to 14th of last month, and I have telegraphed and hope to get a reply tomorrow. If all at home are well, we intend going on to the Pacific. Spent the day in Kansas City, a most interesting town; it is the typical city of the West, and a specimen of what has been done here. The place is only fifteen years old and has now 150,000 inhabitants. Steam tramways constructed at great cost and driven by means of a wire rope and large powerful engines in centre of the work, run round corners, and up and down steep hills, and are splendidly constructed. The ropes, seven or eight miles long, last only eight months. The fare is 5 cents, or 2½d., for any distance. They pay well. Trains run to all parts, and the river Missouri is navigable from the sea. There are fine buildings and splendid residences. The people are from all classes—cowboys, Mexican farmers, blacks, speculators, miners, and fashionable ladies splendidly dressed. I never saw a place so like making money, and 78 one in which people seemed to be doing so well. A gentleman informed me it would not be much beyond the mark to say the people were on the average doubling their capital every year.",75-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rough, uninviting mountains, up which we had to wind our way to the height of about
6,000 or 7,000 feet, and again met with snow. Then we opened on to the Salt Lake Valley,
and the Salt Lake City at last came into view. These people, the Mormons, must have
had good pluck to settle down in such a place. There are no natural advantages about
it, except that the mountain-streams can be used for irrigation. They avail themselves of
this one advantage to the greatest extent. Every street has a stream of water running on
each side of it, and every garden has a spray of water playing on the grass. By this means
vegetation is kept up, and I suppose the people manage to exist in tolerable comfort.
Anyhow, the dinner here at the hotel was one of the best we have had in the States,
and very well cooked and served. The game dish was black bear, which I 86 tasted and
enjoyed. The train leaves at 2 tomorrow. We shall have time to look round us before we
start, and perhaps to bathe in the lake. —It was too cold for a bathe in the lake and some distance to get to it; we therefore
took a carriage, with Mr. Todd and his wife, and drove round the place. The Mormons
who are well-to-do have in some cases many wives, and have houses built one beside
the other and a wife in each; but they say, not above one in fifty has more than one wife.
In some cases they have many wives, and it does not seem to work so badly as might
be expected, the first wife having to give her consent to any future marriage. The central
government have now made these marriages illegal, and are punishing the offenders—
several are now in prison. They have constructed a fort on high ground overlooking the
town, and have some big guns and a thousand soldiers in it, so that I expect the Mormons
will have to give in. However, it is quite on the cards there will 87 be trouble over it, as
there are five Mormons to every Gentile here. The Tabernacle, a very large building with
an arched roof, will seat 10,000 people. You can hear a pin drop from the reading-desk
when standing at any part of the building. This is a fact, as we tried it. The Temple is
a very ugly stone building not half completed, but already thirty-two years in building. I
should say it never will be finished. I fancy the whole thing is a swindle by the leaders on the people, who are uneducated. Emigrants are constantly coming in; five hundred arrived
from Sweden and other countries last week. The Salt Lake is a large piece of water, very
salt, about one-fifth being solid salt. It is a miserable place, and smells badly in shallow
places in the sun. The lake is 100 miles long, and has an island in it 10 miles long. We
started in the afternoon on a journey from Salt Lake to San Francisco, about 800 miles.",87,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We took a steam rope-tram to the end of a long street running on to high ground, and then walked on to a hill overlooking the town, harbour, and ocean, so that we might see where we were and find our way about. It is a fine city, and may be called the wooden city. I should have thought it almost impossible to build such splendid, well-designed, enormous buildings of wood. No wonder these places burn; the wonder to me is they do not all go when one starts. Tonight the boys are crying full particulars of the fire, so I suppose there has been a large one somewhere. We have put up at the Baldwin Hotel, a very fine place, but nothing like so large as the Palace Hotel, which makes up a thousand beds. Both these places are of wood, and wonderful places they are. Some travelling companions, Mr. and Mrs. Todd, came to dine with us here, and we went to the Palace Hotel, where they were staying, to hear the band in the covered courtyard there. Mr. Todd is a young engineer, but has broken up his business in the East in order to settle in a western town, as the only chance of saving his wife, who is consumptive. They are Americans of very good type, but under the circumstances a little low-spirited. A clergyman stopped us in the street. We came across the Atlantic with him, and now have run against him again, after having each travelled some four or five thousand miles since we parted. Went with Mr. and Mrs. Todd to the park, and on to the coast at a place called the Seal Rocks, where a fine view is to be had of the Pacific Ocean and coast. The harbour is a splendid one, large enough to take all the fleets in the world, and the entrance through the Golden Gate very fine indeed. There is an island in front to protect the harbour, something like Spike Island at Cork, and the harbour is not very much unlike it in many respects. The seals playing about the rocks are very numerous and large; they seemed to me more like sea-lions than seals. An old king-seal, well known, sat on one rock. He was much larger than the rest, and we were told was absolute lord and master of the lot. There is no law against shooting these seals, but good feeling and public opinion protect them. We had lunch at a place overlooking the rocks, and returned to the city to dine. After dinner I hired a guide to take us over the Chinese quarter of this city. There are, I am told, about fifty thousand Chinese here; one part of it is given up entirely to them, and they live I suppose much in the same way as they do in the low parts of the cities in China. The shops in the respectable streets are not at all bad, and seem to be kept, by respectable members of society; but as we wanted to see everything, and we had as a guide a very intelligent man, who got his living in the daytime by interpreting for the Chinese who cannot speak English, and seemed to be well known, we got him to take us into some of the worst districts. First we went into a sort of temple where there were five of their gods. These were supposed to be the ancestors of the race this particular temple belonged to, and the records dated back some three thousand years, but from what I could see and find out I fancy it was more a sort of divining-room than a place of worship. There were vases filled with slips of hard wood, each having certain words on it. In cases of illness, it is the custom for them to draw out one of these pieces of wood; the word on it has then to be turned out on some scroll, and opposite the name of the medicine to be taken is given, and the patient takes whatever it may be. Then again there are pieces of wood, shaped something like a boat. These are thrown up, and if they fall in a certain way the question to be decided is favourable, if in another unfavourable. A tray of sand is kept, over which a kind of stick pointed at one end is suspended, and touched so as to make marks....We then went through some of the lowest and worst streets and alleys, some very filthy, and up into an opium-smoking establishment—a dirty loft with shelves for the smokers. A man in charge, in a sort of bed, prepares the opium by burning it in a lamp. It is quite an art, they say, and when cooked smells quite nice. The smoker then takes it and swallows all the smoke he can get from it, passing it out (after retaining it as long as possible) through his nose. The agreeable sensation comes on some time afterwards and leaves them in a sort of dream. There were twenty men I should think in this place, and all looked more dead than alive; none seemed to have enough energy to look at us even. The place smelt very strong. We paid a quarter of a dollar for the information and instruction, and
were glad to get into the air. A more dreadful place it is almost impossible to conceive.",90-96,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our yesterday's drive and rail ride was all through Oregon Territory, and a splendid district it is. Portland is a very nice business city on the Willamette River. There are some very fine stores here, and at the back there are capital residences with good well-kept gardens. The people are not so much in a hurry as those in most of the other cities, and seem contented and well-to-do. We turned the hotel register back some distance, but could not find a name from England. As there is splendid fishing, shooting, and scenery, I wonder more do not come. There are two beautiful mountains —extinct volcanoes—Mount Hood and Mount St. Helen—in sight, covered with snow a long way down. The river is a very fine one; any-sized vessel almost can get up here. Several English vessels are now taking in timber, as this is one of the greatest timberproducing States. The lumbering, i.e. cutting timber, is a big trade. A district is purchased and a regular lumbering gang formed, usually about 150 hands; a tram is laid down one of the valleys to the nearest stream to bring the timber down, and a small winding engine is used to pull the logs to the trams. The trees are cut off about six feet from the ground (timber is so plentiful they do not mind how much they waste). It is then cross-cut into the desired lengths; one man does this, even for the largest logs, and they are sent down to the mill, usually on the creek. The men get 1¼ dollars a day and their food; the foreman this year 85 dollars a month. The cook of the camp is an important personage and well paid. The men are a rough lot, work ten hours a day, and gamble and sleep away the rest of the time.

The country round is well cultivated; in fact, almost as well as one of the home counties of England. It is not a great manufacturing town, but I suppose has a large trading business as the centre of a fine agricultural district. The buildings are very large in some cases, and the foundations have to be piled, as it is on a sand. The bridges over the Mississippi are high up and useful, but not beautiful. The roads are paved in most cases with round wood blocks. This hotel, the Ryan, is built by a man who made a very large fortune in California in mining, and is now spending it in blocks of buildings in this city. He must be a man of considerable judgment and very rich, as it is splendidly built and very well managed by himself. The portion he has built cost £150,000, and the size is now being doubled. There are some fine residences and roads on the high ground, some of the roads paved with asphalte; and electric light everywhere.",158-160,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtue,1887,Male,England,English,,,1887,,19th century,1880s,44.9723,-93.266,Minneapolis,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",United States of America,Northern America,North America,"Went to Minneapolis this morning. It is a very well built, fine city, and increasing very fast. There were 30,000 immigrants to it last year. The buildings are almost all stone and brick, and the streets well paved. The chief source of wealth is the power given by the river Mississippi here, as there are falls of 50 feet and an immense volume of water. The falls have been lined over with wood to keep the rock from wearing away, as it is soft; and the water is led, part of it at least, into channels by the side, and turbine-wheels fixed, producing an enormous power altogether, but still not half of it is utilised. The Knights of Labour have just begun to build a trade hall at Minneapolis. There is great fear here that they will run up labour too high, and injure the trade of the country. Labour is at present very unmanageable, but a good feature in it is, that when men do work they work well, and do not skulk, as some of our English mechanics do. We went over one large flour-mill, Pillsbury's. It is a sample of what enterprise will do. The power is derived from two turbine wheels, 54 inches diameter and 4 feet deep, with a head of water of 50 feet. This they say gives an effective power of 2,400 horses. There are 240 pairs of rollers in it on one floor; the rollers were made in Buffalo. The wheat is run through seven times, or rather through seven pairs of rollers, and the flour finished by ordinary stones. The whole concern works like a piece of clockwork, and turns out 7,000 barrels of flour in twentyfour hours. They have other mills, making their output altogether 10,500 barrels daily, or sufficient to feed two cities the size of New York. They have two immense elevators in Minneapolis for storing wheat, and have small ones at almost all the railway stations in the surrounding wheat districts, all in communication with the chief office by wire, so that supplies of wheat can be got along as required. They have a railway into the mills, and use two hundred trucks a day to take wheat into, and the productions of it out of, the mills. They have a fine system of precautions against fire: sprinklers which come into play at temperatures below fire heat, and tell-tales which give indication at a less high temperature. The water-power used in these mills as well as the mills belong to the Pillsburys, on whom I called, and found to be very nice people. Their agents in London are Messrs. W. Kline and Son, of Tower Street. The one drawback is that for three months in the winter the sources of the river are frozen, and they are therefore obliged to have a stand-by in the shape of steam engines, which they use during that time. Everything that could be done to save labour was done; the casks were delivered at a spot where they rolled themselves into position and counted themselves. The sacks were put into a spout with a slope to it and then a slight rise, so that they sprung themselves into the conveyances 164 used to remove them. No wonder our millers have a hard time of it with such competition, and I am afraid it looks like lasting. Of course this mill is only one of a number, but I suppose the largest. The best hotel in Minneapolis is large, new, and built of brick and stone. The buildings and shops are altogether excellent. We return to St. Paul in time for dinner, and leave tonight at 8.40 for Chicago.",161-164,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/00382/00382.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
