But this deficiency in aspect proves its superiority as a living and still growing city, the first sign of which is seen in its magnificent stone quays and its lines of warehouses. The immense quantity of wood, planked and stacked for sale, may be a common feature to a good many persons, but it was most surprising to me. We landed and found our way to the great Windsor Hotel, an enormous house, and here we found evidence of the Parisian having safely arrived before us by the presence of Captain Wylie, looking very bright and jolly, and very glad to see us. At this hotel I first realized the general features of the great hotels of the States, of which I shall have to speak by-and-by, so that I will not enter into particulars on the subject here. And if I were to begin to show how Montreal is a fine large city with fine large buildings, and with a very great number of churches, I might be met with the remark, “Of course it is.” But among the buildings most spoken of, I must confess that the yet incomplete Cathedral of St. Peter presented to me nothing that could recall what it is declared to intend to represent on a somewhat smaller scale—the great Basilica at Rome. If you would desire a fine and impressive view of the city, you must ascend Mont Real (or Mount Royal) behind, and survey the impressive scene, reflecting on all the wealth and commerce that is in active and constant movement among the thousands below, belonging to the largest and most important city of the Dominion. The well-wooded sides of the mountain itself, rising 700 feet above the river, are beautiful. Nor is it possible to overlook in the varied and extensive prospect the vast Victoria Bridge, striding across the river and connecting the city and Lower Canada with the New England States and New York—a connection which formerly was carried on by Lake Champlain and the Hudson. The name of the city as at present written shows a curtailment as well as a corruption of its original one, the full name having been La Ville Marie de Mont Real.

Ottawa is vulgarly called “Slab Town,” and, disavowing for my own part the slightest possible of sneers which the name might be thought to convey, I cannot pretend to wonder at its application. Was there ever such an overwhelming labyrinth of heaps and stacks of lumber—that is, timber sawn for use—to be found anywhere else? And if you wish to view a scene of sawing industries that produce all this profusion, go to the Chaudiére, or Caldron Falls, and behold and hear the army of saws that are set in motion by the impatient waters of the Ottawa river, here narrowed by islands to a width of stone two hundred feet, and rushing down for some forty feet over the brows of a rugged slope of rock. This busy, noisy scene of saw and water is sufficiently impressive both to eye and ear, but all the natural wild and boisterous beauty of the Rapids is completely suffocated by the practical uses they are put to.

Samuel Rogers, in that somewhat faint but pretty book of his called “Italy,” says that when he waked in Rome he said to himself, “I am at Rome!” Let me be supposed to have said, “I am at Chicago!” The difference, I will confess, is very great, the sentiments aroused very opposite. But in this case Chicago may serve as a foil to the word “Rome,” and thus be all the more vividly shown forth for what it really is. A raw, crowded, noisy, daring, busy, bustling, thriving young republican city, affording a splendid scene and flourish of trumpets for the first drawing up of the curtain of a visit to the States. In this respect it is far more to the purpose than New York, which is upon the sea and at the very doorway of the country; whereas Chicago is some thousand miles inland from that city...As to the teeming city itself, it is in some places scarcely less perplexing than the Board of Trade, and I must leave it to describe itself by its well-known name: it is Chicago. You may readily traverse it, for there is an extensive construction of the endless cable tramway system, the steel rope being in constant movement, and the cars being moved or stopped by clipping or unclipping connection with the chain underneath, in the centre of the road, and running in an open groove. A very large post-office—all in movement, of course—holds its place in the city; and there are wide streets and narrow streets, and large buildings and small buildings; and (while I was there) every sort of advertisement, including, very ostentatiously, those of rival railway companies, competing one against the other at incredibly cheap fares for great distances, such as some of us may remember, but on a somewhat smaller scale, in the early days of our own English railway system. Chicago appears to deal in the superlative in all matters. Some fifty years ago, it was only a small Indian town. Going as far back as 1830, the report I have referred to gives its population as only 70. In 1850, it was 29,963. In 1885, it was estimated at 727,000. And this, in spite of two conflagrations: that of 1871 one of the most destructive on record anywhere. Its grain elevators and depôts are marvels. The water-works have been called one of the wonders of the world, and its parks are of magnificent extent. They are ten in number, and contain altogether more than 2000 acres, with many miles of carriage drives, besides those along the extensive boulevards. It claims to be the third manufacturing city in the States; stands next to New York in general commercial importance; and to be the greatest grain, live-stock, and lumber market in the world. Yet, says the report, “considering what must be the development of the vast States and Territories, not yet really populated, which must depend on Chicago for the outlet of their produce, we must stand amazed at the future which is spread out before this favoured city situated at the head of a mighty chain of inland seas a highway along which to distribute the multiform products of an immense region, and by which in return to supply the varied wants of an increasing civilisation.” Already twenty-six railways converge in the city.",55-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapidity of the growth of these two cities, as officially reported, seems incredible. In 1860, the total population of the two was but 16,222; in 1884, it had grown to little short of 200,000; when I was there, each was claiming 150,000. There are only ten miles between them, and, in spite of their rivalry, a junction is predicted of the two into one. Anything in the shape of development appears to be possible in the States. The Americans have not only introduced new modes of spelling words, but they have given them a new meaning, and a very extended one in this instance. Nature, in the States, has permitted the junction of two elements which she has been justly charged with denying in other regions: a strong race with a strong land. Here she can give all she is properly asked for, and she is tolerably sure of being asked for everything she has to give. That by-and-by she will have a great many more to give to than she has now on her hands out here is a matter which must be left to the future to take care of. Both cities are on the Mississippi, which, in Indian language, signifies “The Father of Waters;” but it struck me that Minneapolis is the better placed of the two, because it can make more use of the mighty river than St. Paul can. I allude to the water-power at what are called the Falls of St. Anthony. It is round these falls that are constructed the gigantic flour-mills of Messrs. Pilsbury, which form the chief sight at Minneapolis, and where again figures of millions are put forward. In 1879, the millers there manipulated 7,514,364 bushels of wheat; and in 1885, the returns gave 32,112,840. Another calculation for 1885 is that the mills together are capable of delivering 33,973 barrels (of 60 lb.) per day; an amount said to be equal to the day's necessities of one-half of the population of Great Britain.",74-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All lies in front of the hotel, and it involves a very long walk to visit all the surface. The geysers, large and small, extending over this (so to speak) white territory, are said to be fifty in number; the large ones bear the several curious names of Old Faithful, the Bee-Hive, Castle, Splendid, Grand, Giantess, Giant, Lion, Lioness and Cubs, etc., etc. But herein. lies the great disappointment and drawback: they never go off altogether except in a picture. You may even lose days to see nothing but: the ridiculously named “Old Faithful;” and thus the impression of this visit to what we are told is the “grandest country, spectacularly, God Almighty has made,” and that it is “the Supreme Builder's own design and completion,” turns out disappointing. For our own part, we were not over-fortunate; Old Faithful, of course, we saw, for he goes off every seventy minutes or so, and is scarcely five minutes from the hotel. He is the mainstay of the visit, and yet, if you want to see the others, he at last begins to be almost a sort of nuisance. For ourselves, the first thing we heard on our arrival was that the Castle had just gone off, “about an hour ago,” and that the Grand had played “yesterday.” On the Saturday morning we were told that the Grand and the Giant had both been playing in the night; while the Beehive was disappointing everybody, as it had never been quiet for so long an interval. All that was accorded to us was a sudden call at supper on this last day, when some one came rushing in to say the large Cub had begun, and that the little one and the Lioness were sure to follow. And so they did; but the Lioness gave little more than a growl and lay down again, while the Cubs only behaved like cubs.",89-90,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plenty of the well-known corrugated iron is converted into use, if not beauty. I verily believe, from all I could gather, that this spot, situated as it is in the northwest of Canada, with almost unbounded capacities for corn and cattle around, is destined to become the focus of an immense thriving population. The grazing lands are spoken of as embracing four thousand square miles. Cattle already abound. The beef I ate from the rude kitchen was excellent.

In the year 1870 it contained a population of only 1100; by 1880, as a result of the construction of the eastern section of the Northern Pacific line, and the approaching completion of the great transcontinental system, the number had increased to 23,000. But in 1883 the population was given as nearly 40,000. Although one hundred miles from the coast, Portland is virtually a seaport, and vessels of 3000 tons may be seen loading at its wharfs; and in the busy season a perfect fleet of merchantmen is employed in shipping the great wheat crop of Oregon to Europe. The trade in tinned salmon from the Columbia is also very large; but, considering the immense destruction that is going on amidst the almost fabulous abundance of this fish in all these western waters, it seems possible that this item of commerce may not be continuously so extensive. Its position is attractive and picturesque. “It is a novel experience,” writes Mr. Fee in his pamphlet, from which some of these particulars are taken, “to stand in the primæval forest which hugs the city closely on all sides, and look down upon the bustling activity of trade and pleasure. Here are the tall pines and the dark thicket; there the masts, the smoky chimneys, and the dusty streets.” From Robinson's Hill the view comprises the rivers and all the five mountains: Mounts Jefferson and Hood, in Oregon, and, to the north, Mounts Adams and St. Helen's, with Tacoma at a greater distance. There are many resident thriving merchants, whose villas bespeak their wealth and adorn the suburbs. The climate is commendable as partaking of the softness of the Pacific, in contrast with the harshness of the Atlantic Ocean; and it is customary to compare the two Portlands in this respect. Portland in Maine is of rather a lower latitude than Portland in Oregon, the former standing at about 43° north, and the latter at about 46°. But the difference between the two climates, in favour of the latter, is so marked, and was so often mentioned to me, that I offered the following distich:— While Portland, Maine, lies wrapt in snow, In Portland, Oregon, the roses blow.",125-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Americans have not only introduced new modes of spelling words, but they have given them a new meaning, and a very extended one in this instance. Nature, in the States, has permitted the junction of two elements which she has been justly charged with denying in other regions: a strong race with a strong land. Here she can give all she is properly asked for, and she is tolerably sure of being asked for everything she has to give. That by-and-by she will have a great many more to give to than she has now on her hands out here is a matter which must be left to the future to take care of. Both cities are on the Mississippi, which, in Indian language, signifies “The Father of Waters;” but it struck me that Minneapolis is the better placed of the two, because it can make more use of the mighty river than St. Paul can. I allude to the water-power at what are called the Falls of St. Anthony. It is round these falls that are constructed the gigantic flour-mills of Messrs. Pilsbury, which form the chief sight at Minneapolis, and where again figures of millions are put forward. In 1879, the millers there manipulated 7,514,364 bushels of wheat; and in 1885, the returns gave 32,112,840. Another calculation for 1885 is that the mills together are capable of delivering 33,973 barrels (of 60 lb.) per day; an amount said to be equal to the day's necessities of one-half of the population of Great Britain.",74-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All lies in front of the hotel, and it involves a very long walk to visit all the surface. The geysers, large and small, extending over this (so to speak) white territory, are said to be fifty in number; the large ones bear the several curious names of Old Faithful, the Bee-Hive, Castle, Splendid, Grand, Giantess, Giant, Lion, Lioness and Cubs, etc., etc. But herein. lies the great disappointment and drawback: they never go off altogether except in a picture. You may even lose days to see nothing but: the ridiculously named “Old Faithful;” and thus the impression of this visit to what we are told is the “grandest country, spectacularly, God Almighty has made,” and that it is “the Supreme Builder's own design and completion,” turns out disappointing. For our own part, we were not over-fortunate; Old Faithful, of course, we saw, for he goes off every seventy minutes or so, and is scarcely five minutes from the hotel. He is the mainstay of the visit, and yet, if you want to see the others, he at last begins to be almost a sort of nuisance. For ourselves, the first thing we heard on our arrival was that the Castle had just gone off, “about an hour ago,” and that the Grand had played “yesterday.” On the Saturday morning we were told that the Grand and the Giant had both been playing in the night; while the Beehive was disappointing everybody, as it had never been quiet for so long an interval. All that was accorded to us was a sudden call at supper on this last day, when some one came rushing in to say the large Cub had begun, and that the little one and the Lioness were sure to follow. And so they did; but the Lioness gave little more than a growl and lay down again, while the Cubs only behaved like cubs.",89-90,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have certainly seen, in reality, a city trying to begin, and already the hotel, only partly built, is called “The Royal.” There is also a newspaper, and there are stores. Plenty of the well-known corrugated iron is converted into use, if not beauty. I verily believe, from all I could gather, that this spot, situated as it is in the northwest of Canada, with almost unbounded capacities for corn and cattle around, is destined to become the focus of an immense thriving population. The grazing lands are spoken of as embracing four thousand square miles. Cattle already abound. The beef I ate from the rude kitchen was excellent. Americans are coming in to secure land, and on the very day I was there one of them arrived for the purpose of “locating” five hundred
 horses. They have not yet any great building which they call their Law Courts, and if they
 cannot have anything better than the cumbrous and inconvenient lump of ugliness that
 now adorns the neighbourhood of our Temple Bar, God forbid they ever should have!",117,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the year 1870 it contained a population of only 1100; by 1880, as a result of the construction of the eastern section of the Northern Pacific line, and the approaching completion of the great transcontinental system, the number had increased to 23,000. But in 1883 the population was given as nearly 40,000. Although one hundred miles from the coast, Portland is virtually a seaport, and vessels of 3000 tons may be seen loading at its wharfs; and in the busy season a perfect fleet of merchantmen is employed in shipping the great wheat crop of Oregon to Europe. The trade in tinned salmon from the Columbia is also very large; but, considering the immense destruction that is going on amidst the almost fabulous abundance of this fish in all these western waters, it seems possible that this item of commerce may not be continuously so extensive. Its position is attractive and picturesque. “It is a novel experience,” writes Mr. Fee in his pamphlet, from which some of these particulars are taken, “to stand in the primæval forest which hugs the city closely on all sides, and look down upon the bustling activity of trade and pleasure. Here are the tall pines and the dark thicket; there the masts, the smoky chimneys, and the dusty streets.” From Robinson's Hill the view comprises the rivers and all the five mountains: Mounts Jefferson and Hood, in Oregon, and, to the north, Mounts Adams and St. Helen's, with Tacoma at a greater distance. There are many resident thriving merchants, whose villas bespeak their wealth and adorn the suburbs. The climate is commendable as partaking of the softness of the Pacific, in contrast with the harshness of the Atlantic Ocean; and it is customary to compare the two Portlands in this respect. Portland in Maine is of rather a lower latitude than Portland in Oregon, the former standing at about 43° north, and the latter at about 46°. But the difference between the two climates, in favour of the latter, is so marked, and was so often mentioned to me, that I offered the following distich:— While Portland, Maine, lies wrapt in snow, In Portland, Oregon, the roses blow.",125-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01390/01390.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
