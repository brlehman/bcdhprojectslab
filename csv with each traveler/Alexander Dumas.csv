The name it bears, and which has been given to it by modern travellers, has no connexion with its origin. Indeed, if we may credit Greek inscription, this monument is no older than the time of Dioclesian. It has a slight inclination to the South. The capital and base have never been finished. I did not measure its height; but it is loftier by two-thirds than the palm-trees around it. Cleopatra's Needles, of which one (as I before re- marked) has fallen, are obelisks of red granite, having three columns of hieroglyphics on each side. [...] The antique thimbles, which served for the base of these obelisks, still re- main; they rest on socles of three steps, are of Greco- Romanic construction, and confirm the architectural date of the received tradition, which affirms that their second erection occurred about forty years before CHRIST.",27-28,,,Hathi Trust,

We waded through a sea of sand, in which our attendants and asses sank knee-deep. Occasionally we were blind- ed by gusts of hot wind mixed with dust; and we knew, from the momentary oppression at our lungs, as it passed, that we were encountering the burning breath of the Desert. Here and there, on either hand, were circular villages, built on the rising ground, which, during the overflow of the Nile, be- come islands. The houses are of a conical form, built of brick and earth, and pierced with small, square holes, designed to admit just as much light as is strictly necessary, with just as little heat as possible. At intervals, too, we passed several isolated tombs of hermits and dervises, each shaded by a palm tree; that consecrated friend of the sepulchre, around the tops of which clouds of shrieking hawks flew at our approach.",39,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

 We trudged along for several hours through the sand ; and then, ascending a hill, we unexpectedly saw from its summit the Nile !
 Delightful landscapes now succeeded arid plains. In place of a palm-tree here and there lost in the burning horizon, we found forests of fruit-trees and fields of maize. Egypt is a valley, with a river in its centre and an immense garden on each side, shut in by the Desert. Birds of ruby and emerald, of brilliant song and plumage, unknown to us, fill the groves of mimosa and lilachs. Large droves of sheep and buffalo, led by lean, naked herdsmen, followed the course of the Nile which we were ascending. And, finally, by way of climax, two enormous wolves, attracted no doubt by the scent of the cattle, emerged from a wood fifty yards in front, and came to a halt as if to arrest our progress : our guides, however, succeeded in beating them off with stones. Night descended rapidly, and our way, intersected by ditches necessary to the irrigation of the country, became more and more toilsome. In many places our asses sunk to their knees in the swamps, and we were obliged to dismount; and occasionally we ford- ed actual torrents, wading to our armpits : this sort of bath, though much cooler, was also much less agreeable than that of Alexandria. At length the moon arose in full brilliancy, illumined our path, and gave a new character to this strange landscape. Despite our embarrassments, we could not be insensible to its beauties. On the summit of the hills which divide the valley from the Desert, the palm-trees gracefully waved their branches against the sky. Mosques were visible in every direction, their bases laved by the Nile, their walls surrounded by the shade and verdure of the sycamore. But we were constantly interrupted in our ecstacy, by a bog or a ditch ; so that, by the time Rosetta was in sight, we were drenched altogether, and our shoes, like Panurge's, took in water from our shirt-collars.",43,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

Amon gave us these details while taking us to see the mosque of Abou Mandour, which is out of the city and on the bank of the Nile. This oriental edifice stands in the midst of a charming landscape, and reaches far into the river, leaving a narrow pas- sage between its base and the opposite shore. A dome in the form of a heart reversed, surmounted by a crescent, crowns its white and festooned walls : from one of the angles, a madeneh of rare elegance elevates its galleries, while the opposite side seems to uphold an enormous mass of sand, resting like a hill on the declivity of the mountain. Tall palm- trees, also, shoot up their single stems through the thick and sombre foliage of the sycamores, crowning them as with an aigrette. The true believers say that the holy dervise, Abou-Mandour, sustains on his shoulders the mountains of sand which seem ready to swallow up the mosque, and choke the current of the Nile.",48,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

We retired to the stern of our vessel, where the sailors had constructed a tent, or rather an arch of cloth supported by bamboos. We spread our car- pets beneath, and did not wake till morning.

 We were unable to turn away from the gigantic monuments to which belonged so grand a record of antiquity, and so glorious a memento of modern days. There, too, was the battle-field of the modern Cambyses, where we, like Herodotus viewing the corses of the Persians and Egyptians, might have discovered the bones of our fathers. As the sun descended, his beams climbed the sides of the Pyramids, leaving their base in shade ; soon the summit alone sparkled, like a reddened point, and then a single ray, like a dis- tant beacon-light, seemed to float on the sharpened extremity. This soon detached itself and ascended towards the sky, as if to light up the stars, which, a moment after, began to twinkle in the firmament.",51,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

At the foot of the Lybian range we began to perceive, through the sandy va- pours that darkened the air, the towers and domes of mosques surmounted with their crescents of bronze. By degrees this curtain, driven by the northern wind which wafted us along, was uplifted from Cairo, and we discovered the jagged outline of the tops of the buildings, their foundations being yet hidden by the swollen banks of the river.",56,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

In front lay the island of Roudah, the base of the monument where the Nilometer is preserved; an instrument which measures the height of the inundations of the Nile. The lines traced on it indicate the years when the overflow of the water, reaching an unusual elevation, causes seasons of remarkable fertility. Here, every year, the sheiks of the mosques declare the height of the inundation, and apportion the measure of rejoicing which the people may indulge in ; or, with the resignation of Mussulmans, announce sterility and the fasting and famine to which the insufficient rising of the river condemns them. On our right stood the Pyramids of Gizeh, visible from the base to the summit; and there, too, was the hill formed by the Great Sphinx, which has guarded them for three thousand years, turning its granite face, mutilated by the soldiers of Cambyses, towards the tomb of the Pharaohs. On our left, was the bat-tlefield of Heliopolis, rendered famous by Kleber; its immense solitude extends farther than the eye can reach, and is enlivened by one sycamore which flourishes in the burning sand of the Desert.",57-58,,,Hathi Trust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008642282

We sped through sumptuous bazaars, and streets crowded with Arabs and tents, until we arrived at the gigantic mosque of the Sultan Hassan. We next took the steep path leading, first, to Joseph's Divan, near which is a famous well, described to us by M. Taylor. It is quadrangular in form, and is designed to supply the citadel with water: its depth is said to reach the level of the bed of the river.
