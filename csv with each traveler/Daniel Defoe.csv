Robinson",1742,Male,,English,,1740,1742,,18th century,1740s,57.09922398,-4.35854678,Scotland,Scotland,United Kingdom,Western Europe; Atlantic Islands,Europe,"A brief Geographical Account of Scotland. 
     Scotland is bounded on the North by the Irish Sea and England, from which it is divided by Solway Firth, and the Rivers Esk and Kexsop; on the West Border, by the Cheviot Hills in the Middle Marches; and by the lower Parts of the Tweed, on the East Border.  On the East it is bounded by the German Sea; on the North by the Deucaledonian Sea; and on the West, by the great Western Ocean.
     Its greatest Length from Dungsby-head or John of Grot's-house in Caithness, to the Mull of Galoway towards Ireland, is no more than about 215 Scots Miles; but if we reckon directly North from Dumfries, or the said Mull of Galloway, to the utmost Parts of Caithness, or Strathnavern, the Length will not be so much; and less still, if we reckon brom Berwick to either of these Places. 
     Its Breadth, from the Point of Ard-na-murchan near the Isle of Mull, about the middle Part of Scotland in the West, to Buchan-ness in the East Parts, towards the North, is about 140 Scots Miles; but the Sea running up into the Land, or the Land thrusting out into the Sea in many Places, makes the Breadth of it every-where else very various and disproportionable; for in the South Parts it is seldom 100 Miles over, and in the North Parts, beyond Inverness, not so many; so that there is no House above 40 or 45 Miles from salt Water.
     Besides the main Land, there are about 300 Islands, some of them very considerable, which may be distinguished into several Classes: The Western Islands called Hebrides, or Æbudæ, by Latin Authors; the Orcades, or Orkney Islands: the Islands of Shetland, or Zetland, and some few in the Firth of Forth.
The whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers, many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea, (which in several Places are very wide and deep) afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fishing and Shipping: But 'tis much to be regretted, that the Land is neither cultivated, nor the Fishing and Shipping carried on and improved, to so much Advantage as might be expected. 
     Tho' the Soil is not generally so level and fruitful as that of England, yet the South Parts of Scotland are far more pleasant than, and preferable to, the North Parts of England; and there are every-where all Things necessary for human Life: And not only sufficient for the Inhabitants, but also to export and exchange for such foreign Commodities as the People want, and to return considerable Sums. (vol. IV, pp. 1-2)


The Salmon-fishery is particularly the Boast and Delight of the Scots; insomuch that for it they too much neglect all the rest.
Their SALMON are accounted the best in Europe, and tho' their Barrels be a Third less than that of Berwick, yet they have yielded 10 Livres more per Barrel, in France; partly because of the Goodness, and partly because better cured, wherein the Magistrates and Town-council of Aberdeen take a very particular Care. Salmon abount not only in the navigable Rivers of Scotland, but in those which are less, in most Parts of the Kingdom; and they valued them so much formerly, that in several of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad selling them to England, except for Gold. Clyde abounds with Salmon, for which the Town of Renfrew has been famous and Bishop Lesley, in his Description of Scotland, says, They used, in his Time, to employ sixty Vessels in Fishing most of Spring and Summer; but 'tis much short of Aberdeen, where the same Author says, the Rivers Dee and Don exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon : For which he assigns this Reason, That they delight in clear Streams, which occasions our Rivers in Scotland to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy. The other Places, most remarkable for Salmon-fishing in Scotland, and in the Dovern at Bamf, the Rivers Nesse, Nairn, Findorn, Lossey and Spey in Murray; the latter abounds with Salmon for 60 Miles together. Lochlomond in Lenox is remarkable for Salmon of excellent Taste, Loch-ou in Argyll, the like: And there is good Salmon-fishing in the Rivers Lough and Speynie in Lochaber, in the Bay of Cromarty, near Dingwal Castle, and in the Rivers Tay and Tween, and other smaller Rivers in the bordering Counties. They have marl'd or speckled Salmon in Harries, North-uist and Benbecula. And in the Isle of Sky, there are no less than 30 Rivers all abounding with Salmon. (vol. IV pp. 6-7)

As to their COD-fishing, Mr. Spruel (an eminent Scots Merchant, who laid an Account of the Product of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parliament, some Years ago) says, he was inform'd by a Yarmouth Man, who use to buy those Fish and Salt on the Scots Coast, that he has sometimes got four thousand cur'd Fish in a Voyage, at 1d. or 2d. apiece, and retail'd them again from 18d. to 2s. 6d. apiece; which shews what vast Advantage might be made of the Trade, since the Scots Cod are reckon'd as good or better than those of Newfoundland. And what cont[r]ibutes much to the Cheapness of this and the Herring-fishery in Scotland, is that they are caught with fewer Hands, and Vessels of far less Expence, than Doggers, which must be well mann'd and strong, because oblig'd to lie at Sea; whereas the Scots catch those Fish in their own Creeks, Bays, and Harbours, wwhere few Hands and open Vessels are for the most part sufficient, because they are seldom exposed to any Danger by Storms, being always near the Shore, and laid up at Night. (vol. IV, p. 7)

HERRINGS abound on all the Coasts of the Kingdom, but especially on the Western Isles, which are reckon'd the best and fattest, tho' not so large as those taken on the Eastern and Northern Coasts. The Scots Herring-fishing is accounted the best in the World, and the Dutch have got a great Part of their Wealth by it. (vol. IV, p. 7)


Haddocks, Sturgeon, Turbut, Trouts, Perch, Pike, Scate, Greyberd, Maycril, Keeling, Whiting, Sea-urchin, Cat-fish, Cockpadle, Lyths, Spirlings, Soles, Flukes, Garvie, Eels, are also caught on the Scotish Coasts in great Plenty, for Home-consumption.
Otters, whose Skins are useful for Muffs, &c. are very numerous in the Isles.
Shell-fish of all sorts, as Lobsters, Crabs, Oysters, are also found in vast Quantities in the Western Islands ; the latter so large, that they must be cut in three or four Pieces, to be eaten.
Cockles, Muscles, Limpets, Wilks, Scallops, and Spouts, are cast up by the Tide in such Numbers on the Isles, that the People cannot consume them. (vol. IV, p. 9)


PEARL being the Product of Fish, it is proper to discourse of the Scots Pearl here. Mr. Spruel, the Merchant above-mentioned, who understood the Pearl-trade best of any Man in the Kingdom, having dealt in it above forty Years, says, He has sometimes given a hundred Rixdollars, which is near 25 l. for one Scots Pearl ; and that he had Scots Pearl as fine, clear, and more transparent, than any Oriental Pearl. Tho' the latter be more easily match'd because they are all of a yellow Water, yet Foreigners covet Scots Pearl. The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearl-shell, the more Sign it is of the Age and Goodness of a Pearl; for the smooth Shells are young and barren: Therefore he proposed, that a Law should be made to forbid the Fishing of young Pearl ; for the longer they stay in the Water, the more valuable they are : So that he would have no Shells taken up less than four Inches in Length, or two or three in Breadth ; and that none should be allowed to offery any Pearl to be sold, that weighs less than five Grains; which is as reasonable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon, since Pearl are of much more Value; whereas, had they lain in the Waters their due Time, they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece. 
Pearl is found in most Place of the Nation where Salmon are taken ; and once in twenty Years, he says, there is a great Pearl-fishing in Scotland. This does not hinder, but that Pearl-shells of the Size he proposes, or larger, may be taken up at any time when found ; and these are probably to be had among the unfrequented Isles....
Tho' the small Pearl be not so useful for Ornament, yet they may be of very good Use in Physick, and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills, being reputed the chief of all Cordials, and very good against the Plague, violent and pestilential Fevers, Fluxes, Heart-burning, Giddiness of the Head, Trembling of the Heart, &c. which is sufficient to shew, that the Pearl-fishery well deserves Encouragement, since we may be supply'd with it much cheaper at Home, than from the Indies. (vol. IV, pp. 9-11)


THE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; which are generally black, except in Corn-soils, where they seldom breed or keep any more than are necessary for the Plough or the Pail. But 'tis observable, that such as are bred in other Parts, and equal in Size to those bred in some Parts of England, even where the Land seems to be better.
In general, their Sheep and Cattle are much smaller than those of England, especially in Pasture-lands ; yet are they of a far sweeter and more delicious Taste.   The Highlanders bring great Numbers of them yearly into the Lowlands, where some are fatted ; but the Bulk of them, and also many of those bred in the Lowlands, are sent into divers Parts of England, especially to St. Faith's near Norwich, where they turn out to good Account; as I have observed in its Place.
They have also very many Hogs, and an incredible Number of Goats, particularly in the North and Highlands ; the latter they eat themselves, but the former they pickle and export, as they likewise do vast Quantities of Salt Beef.
In the Southern Counties there are no Deer, except in Gentlemens Parks ; but every-where else, they are in great Plenty.
They breed great Numbers of Horses, especially in Galloway and the Highland ; small indeed, but capable of great Fatigue, especially if we consider, that they are not only more proper for the Saddle, and other Uses in the Country, which being hilly, will not admit, in many Place, of Teams and Carriages ; but are more hardy than Horses of a larger Size, and will thrive upon what would starve great Horses. Nevertheless, in many Places of the Lowlands they can breed Horses fit for War, Coach, or Carriage.
Scotland has not only Plenty of domestick Fowl, such as are common to other Countries ; but many that are peculiar to themselves, especially in the Islands, where they are in such Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither consume nore vend half of them ; but their Trade for them will still increase, as it has done since the Union.
Their Fowl and Eggs afford a large Fund of Trade for Food, and their Feathers for Bedding and other Uses : Their Fat is made use of by the Inhabitants not only in many Cases where Oil is necessary, but likewise for Physick. (vol. IV, pp. 11-12)


FLAX abounds in Scotland, so that besides what they consume themselves, they export great Quantities of Linen, brown and whitened ; which is one of the greatest Manufactures of the Kingdom, and, if duly regulated and encourage, as it is more and more since the Union, might save a great deal of Money in the Island, besides what it may bring in to it ; for the Scots have improved their Linen Manufacture much of late ; and beside fine Linen, make very good Holland, Cambrick, Muslins, plain and striped, Calicoes, Damask, Ticken for Beds, &c. which and dyed Threads, Laces, Tape, &c. 
Mr. Spruel (in his Account current betwixt Scotland and England) says, He has known, out of a Pound of Flax of Scots Growth, which cost but 12 d. six Spangles of fine Yarn spun, which was sold at Glasgow at about 4 s. 8 d. per Spangle ; which made the Product of that 12 d. to the Spinners 28 s. and, made into fine Muslin, that same Pound of Flax amounted to 10 or 12 Dollars, which is 2 l. 16 s. 8 d. or 2 l. 16 s. the Charges of Weaving and Whitening deducted. He adds, that from one Pound of Scots Flax, Lace-makers have made Lace to the Value of 8 l. Sterling ; which is sufficient to shew how much the Linen Manufacture may be improv'd there, and how many poor Women, who are not capable of employing themselves otherwise, may get a Livelihood by it, and what Money it may bring into the Nation.
Their HEMP is also capable of being improved, not only to save Money in the Island, which is exported for Canvas, Sailcloth, &c. but also to export, and to make Nets for their Fishers, and other Uses. 
The numerous and large Flocks of Sheep they have in Scotland produce abundance of WOOL, from whence come Manufactures of several Sorts ; as Broad-cloth, Coarse or Housewife's-cloth, Fingrims, Serges, Bays, Crapes, Temmin, Glasgow Plaids, Worsted Camblets, and other Stuffs and Stockens for Home-consumption and Export ; besides their Tallow and Skins. Their Wool in general is not so good as that of England ; yet they have brought their Broad-cloth lately to a great Perfection, but can never equal England in that Part of Woolen Manufacture : Nevertheless it is very proper for Serges, Bays, Camblets, Shaloons, and other Stuffs ; and by due Regulation is capable of great Improvement for a foreign Trade. They are come to a great Perfection in making Stuffs ; and for Plaids, I shall observe by-and-by, they exceed all the World. ...

The Scots Plaids are a Manufacture in which they exceed all Nations, as I have said, both as to Colour and Fineness. They have of late been pretty much fansied in England, for Beds, Hangings, Window-curtains, and Night-gowns, for both Sexes ; so that Attempts have been made at Norwich to imitate them ; but they fall much short of the Scots in Colour, Fineness, and Workmanship, as is evident at first Sight. (vol. IV, pp. 12-14)

The Wheat of Scotland is so excellent, that Joseph Scaliger, who had been in the Country, says, No Bread in Europe is comparable to what is made of it, for Whiteness, Lightness, and easy Digestion.  It abounds in the Mers, Lothian, Gavrie, &c. so that they have not only enough for their own consumption, but for Exportation. 
OATS are the most universal Grain of the Kingdom, and exceed those in England, for all Uses.  They grow very well every-where, and in such Quantitites as afford a considerable Fund for Export, both in Grain and Meal, and make very good Break and Drink.
PEASE they have in great Plenty, both for their own Consumption, and for Exportation ; and they are so good of the Kind, that in some Parts of the Country the labouring Husbandmen make good nourishing Bread of them. 
BEANS they have also in great plenty for their own Use, and for Export.
BARLEY grows likewise very well in Scotland ; but they sow more of that Sort they call Beer, which has four Rows of Grain upon an Ear ; whereas Barley has but two : Of this they make good Break, Broth, Ale, and Beer, and export great Quantities. 
RYE grows also very well in Scotland, and makes good Bread ; but this they don't cultivate so much as they do the Grains above-mentioned. (vol. IV, p.15) 

There are many large Woods of OAK in Scotland, which afford Materials for Building and Shipping, and for the Husbandman's Use ; and the Country is very improveable this way, if Planting were more encouraged ; however, they have at present not only such as are fit for the Uses above-mentioned, but also for Pipe-staves and Barrels ; and their Bark is of Use to the Tanners, great Quantities of which are annually exported to Ireland, and elsewhere.  They have likewise ASH TREES, ELMS, and others, fit for Building, and other deomestick Uses ; and great Forests of FIR, which afford Materials for Building and Shipping ; and might, with due Care, afford Pitch and Taw, without being obliged to bring such large Quantities from the Northern Coutnries, as is usually done by the Inhabitants of Great Britain.
     There were formerly many great Woods in Scotland, among which the Forest of Caledonia was famous ; but there are now scarce any Remains of it. 
     The Woods are more rare than formerly in the Southern Parts of the Kingdom ; of which the most remarkable now left are those of Hamilton, Calendar, and Torwood : But in the North, especially in Perthshire, Lochaber, Badenoch, and Mar, there are many Forests, some of them 20, and some 30 Miles in Length. 
     They have abundance of Fruit-trees of all Sorts, in their Gardens and Orchards, and might, by Improvement, not only have sufficient to afford them Fruit for Home-consumption, but also Cyder for their own Drinking and Export.(vol. IV, pp. 16-17)

...of Aberdeen... [Bishop Lesley] says, the Rivers Dee and Don exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon: For which he assigns this Reason, That they delight in clear Streams, which occasions our Rivers in Scotland to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy.  (vol. IV, p. 6)

An Instance of what great Improvement may be made of their Wool, we have from Mr. Spruel (in his Account current); viz. That they make such fine Worsted Stockens at Aberdeen, that they yield 10, 15, 20, and 30 s. a Pair for Womens Stockens; which is sufficient to shew, that they are capable of making Stockens at lower Rates, especially considering that they have store of very good Wool brought thither from the Highland and Isles; which because sold at the Cross of Aberdeen, is commonly called Cross-Wool. (vol. IV, p. 14)

THE most remarkable Mountains of Scotland are the Grampian Mountains, which run from East to West, from near Aberdeen to Cowal in Argyllshire, almost the whole Breadth of the Kingdom, famous for the Battle fought on them betwixt the Romans and 
the ancient Scots and Caledonians, under the Conduct of Galgacus, as we find in Tacitus. (vol. IV, pp. 15-16)",,,,Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/b3052796x_0004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wells are two in Number, near one another ; the higher Well runs through whitish and crystalline Stones, and the lower through black ones, resembling Marcasites of Antimony:  The Smell of the Water is like that of Gunpowder, and it dyes Silver of a black Colour.  To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter resembling stinking Sulphur of Antimony, of a yelloish red Colour; the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of antimony, and some of them contain a metallick Matter, that sparkles like Antimony.  Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook, there sticks to the Rock a whitish Salt, and perhaps a nitrous Matter, which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water.  Those Waters also purge by Stool and Vomit, and are very good against Colick 
and Nephritick Pains, because they powerfully remove the Obstructions of the Bowels.  They are outwardly applied  to Ulcers, and against Pains in the Joints ; they are strongest in their Operation in the driest Season of the Summer and Autumn, but are not so good in a rainy, or in the Winter-season.
