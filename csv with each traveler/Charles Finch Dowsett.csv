Charles Finch Dowsett,A Start in Life; A Journey Across America; Fruit Farming in California.,"Charles Finch Dowsett, A Start in Life; A Journey Across America; Fruit Farming in California (London: Dowsett & Co, 1891), 44-5.",London,Dowsett & Co,1891,Male,,English,,,1890-12-08,,19th century,1890s,37.7797,-122.4308,San Francisco,"San Francisco, California",United States of America,Northern America,North America,"Some of the hills in San Francisco are very steep, and the first sensation in riding on the outside front seat, while going full speed down a sharp declivity, is certainly novel, with no apparent motive power, and no apparent means of stopping. The speed, of course, is always the same, whether up or down hill, or on level ground. Telegraph Hill is 394 feet high, Clay Street Hill 376 feet, and Russian Hill 360 feet. A San Francisco Sunday is painful to one accustomed to our English ways; travelling in every form, and buying and selling are very prevalent. The Y.M.C.A. have a large building there, and get large meetings. I attended one gathering, which I addressed shortly. San Francisco is described as having “the mildest and most equable climate known to any large city in the world.” January is the coldest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 50°. September is the hottest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 58°. Thus only 8° difference between the coldest and warmest months, and the average for the whole year is 54°. San Francisco has a population of about 300,000 (including some 40,000 Chinese), is the principal city of the State of California, and the principal commercial centre on the Pacific coast.",44-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/14340/14340.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
