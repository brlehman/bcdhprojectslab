Archibald W. Finlayson,A Trip to America,"Archibald W. Finlayson, A Trip to America (Glasgow: David Wilson, 1879), 12-6.",Glasgow,David Wilson,1879,Male,,English,,,1879,,19th century,1870s,40.7846,-73.9583,New York City,"New York City, New York",United States of America,Northern America,North America,"New York Bay is one of the most extensive harbours in the world. As you steam into it, you pass between Staten and Long Islands, with pretty villas dotted along their shores and hillsides; then on passing several forts, the great city is before you. It seems as if floating on the water. It reminded me much of the descriptions of Constantinople, only its great dome is not the mosque of St. Sophia, but the Post Office; its “cloud-capped towers” are the spires of newspaper offices, and its “gorgeous palaces” are hotels and dry goods stores. “Forests of masts,” yachts and sail boats, innumerable steamers, and ferry-boats flitting about in all directions at once show what a busy hive it is. NEW YORK is built on Manhattan Island, which is thirteen and a half miles long, with an average breadth of one and a half miles, forming an area of 22 square miles. It is bounded on the east by East River, and on the west by the river Hudson. The city proper is compactly built for about six miles from Battery Point. Two hundred years ago it had a thousand, now it has one million inhabitants. To the east is Brooklyn with 300,000 inhabitants, and to the west is Jersey City with 85,000. These three virtually constitute one great city. The distance across the Hudson between New York and Jersey City is about one mile and a quarter. At the narrowest part of East River, between New York and Brooklyn, a great suspension bridge, 533 yards span, with towers 268 feet high, has been in course of construction since 1870; some think it will never be completed. This is the greatest suspension bridge ever attempted. The original estimate was £1,400,000, but competent authorities state that it will cost £24,000,000. The only means of communication with New York is by ferries, twenty-five in number. Boats ply from each every three to five minutes, and go all night at the principal ones every quarter of an hour. These ferry-boats are very large, just shaped like Noah's Ark, painted white, and the cross-beam of the engine works outside. There are rooms for the passengers on either side, and the centre is for carriages, twenty to thirty of which could, I suppose, cross in one boat. The old portion of New York is very irregularly built, just like any of our own old cities; but the new part is built in uniform square blocks, twenty to the mile. This is the plan adopted in all American cities. In New York, the streets running north and south are called Avenues —First, Second, Third, to Eleventh Avenue—and the cross streets cutting the Avenues at right angles are named First Street, Second Street, Third Street, up to One Hundred and Twentieth Street. The advantages of this system cannot be overestimated; a stranger at once knows where to go, and how far he has to go....The great thoroughfare or artery of New York is Broadway, (80 feet wide); it runs from Battery Point in a straight line through the centre of the city, then branches off in a westerly direction. It is one of the finest thoroughfares in the world. It is the great buisness street, and is lined with fine shops, offices, and large dry goods warehouses, or rather stores , as they are called. The late Mr. A. T. Stewart's retail warehouse, the largest in the world, occupies an entire block; it is six stories high, built of iron, and painted white; his wholesale store is marble. The insurance and newspaper offices are got up regardless of expense. Some of the latter have high towers, to which, I presume, the editors retreat when threatened with a horsewhipping. The houses generally have outside Venetian blinds. The signboards are a perfect study, surpassing in number and variety any attempt at advertising I had previously seen. The side streets are roughly paved; telegraph posts are stuck rudely into the streets at the edge of the pavement; trees line several streets; gaudily-painted figures of Indians and Africans taking snuff stand opposite tobacconists' shops; barbers' poles are innumerable; tramway cars run up the principal streets (except Broadway), and in two or three streets, railway trains run over your head as high as the second storey, in short, commerce is everything, and everything gives way to it. There is a total disregard for appearance or architectural effect; but withal, there is a charm in the bustle around, as you at once feel conscious that you are among an energetic, hard working, great people. The elevated railway is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen attempted in a city. Iron or wooden posts are stuck in at the edge of the pavements, and the street is arched over with cross beams as high as the second storey of the houses. On the top of these the train runs, and the traffic of the street goes on below. In narrow streets which admit only single lines, single posts are used shaped like the letter T. This mode of construction is cheaper than the underground railway in London, and is pleasanter to ride in, but it is most destructive to property. A gentleman who owns several streets told me that some of his warehouses were empty and would never let again, except at greatly reduced rents, and he got no compensation. The bill for such a railway passes, I believe, through the State Parliament. The most imposing building in the city is the Post Office, built of granite, it cost £1,400,000. The Court House is a massive marble building. It cost six millions of pounds sterling, three to four millions of which were stolen by contractors and others. The modern part of the city is well built and paved. The dwellings in the fashionable quarters are equal to the finest residences in Belgravia. The late Mr. A. T. Stewart's house in Fifth Avenue is palatial, built of white marble, and cos £400,000. Central Park, at the end of Fifth Avenue, contains 850 acres, tastefully laid out. It is 2½ miles long and half-amile wide.",45276,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf

Finlayson, A Trip to America (Glasgow: David Wilson, 1879), 20-2.",Glasgow,David Wilson,1879,Male,,English,,,1879,,19th century,1870s,39.9411,-75.1512,Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",United States of America,Northern America,North America,"I then visited PHILADELPHIA. The great quaker city, founded by William Penn, covers the largest area of any city in the United States, and it is next to New York in population; the population is 800,000. The city which lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers is twenty miles long x eight wide, and contains three hundred miles of paved streets, and more houses than any city in the States. Broad Street, the longest in the city, measures twenty three miles. You must not suppose that this street is compactly built for twenty three miles; the meaning is that the municipal boundaries extend that distance. It is customary to carry the names of streets right out into the open country. Broadway runs through New York City, up the Hudson River for 150 miles, and through the city of Albany; and Yonge Street in Toronto runs more than 100 miles in a straight line. For instance, Argyle Street in Glasgow would in all probability be called Argyle Street through Dumbarton as far as Helensburgh, and the High Street of Paisley would be called High Street from Glasgow through Paisley and Howood to Beith. The site of Philadelphia is very flat. The city is substantially built, principally of brick, and white marble is extensively used for window-sills and door-steps. The majority of the streets are only about fifty feet wide, and are lined with trees. It is a great business place, and although there is considerable bustle, the tone is quieter than in New York. The first person I called on was George H. Stuart; he occupies a high place among American philanthropists. He raised enormous sums during the war, and organised the Christian Commission which did so much to alleviate the distress and smooth the pillows of thousands of poor fellows on the field of battle. Mr. Stuart delights in relating stirring incidents of the war, and shows with pride one of the little testaments he had distributed which saved a man's life. The soldier had carried it over his heart, and a bullet had pierced the book and stopped at the last board. Mr. Stuart showed me about Philadelphia. We visited the old State House, where are preserved a collection of portraits, revolutionary relics, the table on which the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, and the old liberty bell, which bears the following inscription:—“Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the people thereof.” We then went to Girard College, the leading charitable institution of the city. Stephen Girard, a banker and merchant, who died in 1831, left his large fortune for the improvement of the city and charitable purposes. The College which bears his name was built and endowed by his funds; it is a truly noble and lasting monument to his memory. In it 850 fatherless boys, between the ages of 6 and 18 years, are boarded and educated entirely free of expense, and afterwards indentured to learn a trade.",20-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf

It has been called “the city of magnificent distances and intentions.” The plan is to have the Capitol in the centre, and to have avenues radiating from it all around. The avenues and streets have been laid out for a city suitable for, I should think, a million, but there are only, I believe, about 80,000 inhabitants, and only a small portion of the city has been built; the consequence is that instead of being in the centre, the Capitol is at the edge of the city facing towards open fields and unbuilt streets lined with trees. I think the city will never be built, as it has no commerce; it is merely the seat of Government. The Capitol is (many say) the largest building in the world. It is a magnificent pile 750 feet long, covers 3½ acres, and stands on rising ground tastefully laid out with shrubs and trees. A great portico of Corinthian columns adorns the entrance, and a magnificent dome similar in shape to St. Paul's in London rises 240 feet above the roof, and on the top is a figure of Liberty. The view of the Potomac and the luxuriant country around is extensive and beautiful. The main part is built of freestone, and painted pure white to the very top; the wings are marble. The spacious halls, marble staircases, statuary, and pictures are worthy of a great nation. The House of Representatives is in one end, and the Senate or Upper House occupies the other. There are galleries in each for the accommodation of 1200 to 1500 strangers. The members' seats are placed in a circular form round the rostrum, from which they address the house. Each member is provided with a spitoon and a desk on which he may write or rest his head or his heels if he chooses. The Supreme Court also sits in the Capitol.",24-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf

It is a beautiful city, and the most English-like of any in the States. The old part is most irregularly built, simply a maze, and although I lived there for several weeks I frequently was puzzled to find my way. A story is told of a stranger who after wandering about for some time, at last asked a policeman the way to such and such a street. “Well,” he replied, “I guess it is about time you were asking, as you have passed me seventeen times.” In the centre of the city there is a park called “the Common,” of about 100 acres, with avenues of grand old elms, and tastefully laid out flower gardens, ornamented with a few fine statues. It is surrounded by streets of splendid private residences and clubs, and at the northern end the gilded dome of the State House towers above the trees. A high granite column is erected on Bunker Hill in commemoration of the defeat of the English, on 17th June, 1775. The 17th of June is an annual holiday, all places of business were closed, and numerous militia regiments paraded the streets, and the Governor of the state reviewed them on the Common. In the great fire which broke out on Saturday evening, 9th November, 1872, and which raged with great fury till Sunday night, 60 acres of the principal business part of the city were reduced to ruins. The losses amounted to the enormous sum of £15,000,000. This portion of the city has been entirely rebuilt, and streets of magnificent warehouses have risen from the ruins. It is worth noting, that in the fire granite buildings crumbled to dust, while those of common brick stood it out. Boston is called “the Hub” (or centre of the wheel) of the Universe; it is celebrated for its literary and benevolent institutions, and the people are highly cultivated and very musical.",34-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf

At Lawrence, a town on the Merrimac river (70 miles from Boston), I was shown over the Pacific Mills, the largest in the world; in them 5,300 hands are employed in the manufacture of cotton cloth and fancy dress goods of wool and cotton. This great concern consists of 12 buildings with 42 acres of flooring, and contains 135,000 cotton spindles, 25,000 worsted spindles, 4,500 looms, and 24 machines which print from one to sixteen colours. More than 1,260,000 yards of cloth are printed or dyed every week. Fifty boilers in a row supply the print-works with steam. The Merrimac river, which I think will be rather 39 more than the width of the Clyde at Glasgow Bridge, is dammed back by a weir 30 feet high, and the water is diverted into a great lade 80 feet wide, and the mills of the Pacific and other companies are supplied with water-power from it. The water-power used by the Pacific is 2300 horse, besides the engines. The mills work 60 hours a week. In going through the print-works, several of the workmen told me that they came from Leven and Thornliebank. There are six other concerns in Lawrence, manufacturing cotton and woollen goods, and all, including the Pacific Company, employ a capital of £1,600,000, over 10,000 hands, 338,000 spindles, and produce over 2,300,000 yards of cloth weekly. Thirty years ago corn grew on the site of these vast mills, but now the thriving town contains 40,000 inhabitants. The Cotton Thread Works of Messrs. J. & P. Coats, at Pawtucket (in the State of Rhode Island), 40 miles from Boston, are very extensive, and consist of three large mills standing parallel to each other. The newest mill (four stories) has the finest rooms I have ever seen —about 400 feet long by 105 feet wide; two of these flats contain 25,000 spinning spindles each. The cotton is spun from the foundation and sent out on spools; 1500 hands are employed, and the mills work 65 hours a week.",38-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf

Words cannot express the glow of delight that I had when I came in sight of the mighty St. Lawrence stretching out like a great sea. The train crosses the St. Lawrence by the Great Victoria Bridge, one of the wonders of the world, nearly 2 miles long, consisting of a series of wrought-iron tubes resting on 24 piers of masonry, the central tube being 830 feet long X 22 feet high, and 16 feet wide, it contains only a single line of rails, and the total cost was £1,300,000, It is a very inelegant structure, but a most useful one, were it not for it the direct communication between Montreal and the States would be entirely cut off. On leaving the bridge, Montreal bursts on your view. The situation of the city could not be surpassed; it rises gradually from the great river, and a richly wooded hill similar in shape to Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh rises abruptly behind the city. This hill has been converted into a public park, and from it is obtained one of the grandest views imaginable. My joy was great at landing in Canada; I rejoiced to be once again among the loyal subjects of the Queen, among whom I knew were many from the land of the heather and blue bell. MONTREAL is a well-built city; the banks and public buildings are imposing, and on the outskirts are innumerable mansions and villas, all substantially built of stone, and many of the streets are lined with trees. There are an immense number of churches, all particularly fine buildings. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame is very grand; accommodates 10,000 persons. There is a great French population, who by treaty are subject to French law.

It seems a great place for lady doctors. Had I been a medical man, I would have thought my occupation gone; certainly my spirit would have been severely troubled at seeing so many large brass door-plates in the principal street, announcing that Dr. Mary, Dr. Jemima, or Dr. Ann So-and-so pursued the “saw-bones” art, or I might on second thoughts brought home one as an assistant , and established the greatest medical firm in the county. A great Parliament House, covering three acres, for New York State is being built of white marble; when finished, it will be one of the greatest buildings in the country, and will cost £3,000,000. One of the leading features of America is the barber's pole; everywhere you turn you see it; and the barber occupies an important position in every hotel in the country. Whenever “young America” is loafing about on a hot day, with nothing particular to do, he steps into the barber's and has a shave to kill time. The Americans seldom allow their whiskers to grow, and as they seldom shave themselves, barbers are in great demand, and do a flourishing trade....The river Hudson has been compared to the Rhine; from Albany to New York, a distance of 150 miles, the scenery is of the grandest description, like a panorama passing before you. The hillsides are covered with orchards and shrubs which attain great perfection. The Catskill mountains, where Rip Van Winkle slept, are imposing; but the most picturesque part is at the town of West Point, where the river is four miles wide, and completely surrounded by high hills rising abruptly from the water. The Military College of West Point (the Sandhurst of America), rests on the shoulder of a hill amid this beautiful scenery. Near New York, the left bank is studded with fine residences, and on the right bank for some 20 miles basaltic cliffs, 300 feet high, tower above the river.",49-50,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13662/13662.pdf
