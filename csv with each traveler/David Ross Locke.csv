They are as smooth as glass. The stone pavements are evenly laid and absolutely without ruts. The wooden pavement, answering to the Nicholson, which has invariably been a failure in America, is a success here, and for a very simple reason.",45-49,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/images/ill_pg_045_sml.jpg,45,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html

Sunday as it was, the sidewalks in front of the numberless cafés were occupied with chairs, the white-aproned waiters flitting hither and thither, serving their customers with the light wines of the country; the market was in full blast, and business was going on the same as any other day.

Nature intended Cork for a great city, but man stepped in and thwarted Nature. It is situated on the most magnificent site for a city there is in all Europe. A wonderfully beautiful river, with water enough to float any vessel, flows through it; and at the mouth of that river, twelve miles below, is one of the great harbors of the world. Queenstown—I wonder that any Irishman ever consented to call it Queenstown—is the nearest port to the great western hemisphere, and Cork should be the center of all the trade from America.",370,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/images/ill_pg_370_sml.jpg,370,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html

Its memories are of monks and opposers of monks; its present is of watches and music boxes. However, the Genevan has been shrewd enough to carefully preserve the dust of the past, out of which, combined with its delightful situation, it gathers many shekels from the horde of tourists who sweep over Europe every year. Everybody must and does see Geneva. It is the capital of the smallest canton in Switzerland but one, the entire territory being but fifteen miles long by as many square, a large portion of this being taken up by the lake. Its population is less than fifty thousand, but, nevertheless, it is the largest city in Switzerland, and one which has the most of historical interest attached to it.",466-473,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/images/ill_pg_466_sml.jpg,466,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html

The old portion dates back to the twelfth century, and contains many interesting relics of that period. But around the old part there has grown up a fine modern city, whose solid substantial buildings, of fine architecture, contrast strangely with the old houses and churches that were built centuries ago.

Its location could not be more beautiful. In front is the clear pale-green lake, from which the limpid Limmat emerges and divides the city into two parts. Its shores are lined with picturesque villas, peeping out from among the orchards and vineyards that clothe the banks, clear to the foot of the snow clad Alps which form a strong background, being so far away that they are soft and subdued in the hazy air that partly obscures them from view.",588,,,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html

Its narrow, crooked streets, with high, many-storied roofs, tell the story of its age in unmistakable language. The unique wood carving that embellishes the façades of so many of the old wooden buildings look strange and out of place in this matter-of-fact age, but in years gone by they gave to Strasburg the name of “the most beautiful city.”",590-592,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/images/ill_pg_596_sml.jpg,596,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html

No matter where you go, nor among what class of people, you see but two things—a vast population catering to sensualism, and another vast population paying the price for it.

The difference between London and Paris is shown even in its proprietary medicines. In London the walls groan, or would if they could, under announcements of liver medicines; in Paris the walls of corresponding conspicuousness are covered with advertisements of articles for the hair and complexion.",245,,,Project Gutenburg,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46451/pg46451-images.html
