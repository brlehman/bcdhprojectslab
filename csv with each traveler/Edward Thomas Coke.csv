And, if I remember right, the only buildings which show their lofty heads above the rest, are the State House, Christ Church (both built prior to the Revolution), a Presbyterian meeting-house, and shot-tower. The city, therefore, when viewed from the water, and at a distance, presents any thing but a picturesque appearance. It is somewhat singular, too, that there should be such a scarcity of spires and conspicuous buildings, there being no fewer than ninety places of worship, besides hospitals and charitable institutions in great numbers. In place, too, of noble piers and quays of solid masonry, which we might reasonably expect to find in a city containing near 140,000 inhabitants, and holding the second rank in commercial importance in North America, there are but some shabby wharfs, and piers of rough piles of timber, jutting out in unequal lengths and shapes, from one end to the other of the river front; and these again are backed by large piles of wood, warehouses, and meanlooking stores... Fifty paces hence, the stranger enters the city, which possesses an interior almost unrivalled in the world. On walking through the fine broad streets, with rows of locust or other trees, which planted on the edge of the causeway, from a most delightful shade, and take away the glare of the brick buildings, he is struck immediately with the air of simplicity, yet strength and durability which all the public edifices possess, while the private dwellings with their neat white marble steps and window-sills bespeak wealth and respectability. The neatness, too, of the dress of every individual, with the total absence of those lazy and dirty vagabonds who ever infest our towns, and loiter about the corners of all the public streets, passing insolent remarks upon every well-dressed man, or even unattended female, impress a foreigner with a most pleasing and favourable idea of an American city. The river in front of the town is about a mile wide, but the channel is considerably contracted by an island which extends nearly the full length of the town, and consequently renders the navigation more intricate. It is prettily planted with trees, and a ship has been run ashore at one end, and converted into a tavern, a house being raised upon the upper deck. It was quite a gala day, numerous steam-vessels and rowing boats, proceeding up the stream to Kensington (part of the suburbs,) and we arrived just in time to see a large ship of 600 tons burthen glide gracefully from the stocks.",30-1,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is upon a lofty eminence, overlooking the plain upon which the city is built; and several broad flights of steps lead to the principal entrance. The first stone was laid by Washington, during his administration, in September, 1793; but it was not finished to its present state until some time after the conclusion of hostilities in 1815, previously to which the wings only were built of substantial materials, the intermediate space between them, now occupied by the Rotunda, being formed of wood. It was consumed in the conflagration of the public buildings which ensued on the entrance of the British into the city, on the evening of the 24th of August, 1814. It is situated nearly in the centre of the area, which contains 22½ acres of ground, and is surrounded by a low wall and strong iron balustrade, a small shrubbery of low trees being planted within the railing. The western front, towards the city, is tastefully laid out in grass terraces and gravel walks; while on the eastern a garden has been fenced off within an iron railing, to which however every one has free access. The eastern front of the building stands upon higher ground than the western; and, to remedy this defect in the appearance, an earthen terrace was formed at some distance (probably 20 feet) from the basement story on the latter side, which, in addition to answering the primary object, affords, by being underbuilt, excellent cellars for fuel. The entrance, then, is from this terrace into the Rotunda, which is on the second story, and paved with stone, receiving light from the dome, 96 feet above the floor. Its diameter is also the same; and the echo of footsteps along the pavement, or the voices of people conversing, almost equals that in the whispering gallery of St. Paul's. The western side of it is ornamented with four large oil-paintings, by Colonel Trumbull, an officer of the American army, and aid-de-camp to Washington during the revolutionary war.",83-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The guide-book told me that “the road to it was uninhabited and difficult to trace;” but setting forth on my pilgrimage, and travelling over a sandy, poor country, I managed tolerably well for the first few miles; until, arriving at the meeting of four roads, I was at a complete non-plus , there being neither sign-post nor living being from whom I might gain further information. Trusting to my horse and good luck, I rode on at a brisk trot for several miles, when, meeting a woman, I discovered that I had taken a wrong road, so struck off at once into the forest; and after losing my temper ten times, and my road twice as often, by an hour after mid-day I arrived at the lodge-gates of Mount Vernon. I was obliged to adopt this inconvenient method of travelling, as the steam vessels from Alexandria, which pass within 200 yards of the house, are not permitted to land passengers, on the plea that great depredations were committed amongst the trees and gardens. The proprietor certainly does not appear to encourage pilgrims to the tomb; the road through the grounds from the lodge to the house being, if possible, worse than the highway, and running for a considerable distance up a deep ravine, and over the rough stony bed of a winter's torrent. It was much the fashion, during my stay in America, for the Volunteer Corps and “Republican Associations of young men,” to make a pilgrimage to the tomb in a body; and the middle and southern States, who never allow an opportunity of having a laugh against their Yankee brethren to escape them, say, that the order forbidding steamers to land their passangers arose in consequence of a gentleman cutting so many walking-sticks from the sacred ground that, upon his return to Boston, he made a good round sum of money by retailing them at a dollar each. The house was originally built by Lawrence Washington pleasant residence during several months. The thermometer frequently stood as high as ninety-six degrees in the shade at Gadsby's hotel: the members of Congress might daily be seen crawling along the Pennsylvania Avenue towards the Capitol, with umbrellas to protect them from the powerful rays of the sun, at ten o'clock; and though receiving eight dollars per day (1 l 14 s. ,) their places were not sinecures, the House only adjourning for an early dinner at two o'clock, and then sitting again until sunset, and once until nine at night",94-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shops in it certainly cannot vie with those even in the latter town; but, in the number of equipages, New-York excels it, and far outvies London, or any English town, in its hackney coaches, which are so remarkably neat, and even handsome, that a foreigner might be well excused for imagining them to be private carriages. Broadway is throughout the day thronged with gay vehicles and equestrians, and a perpetual stream of that convenient but uncomfortable London Carriage, an “omnibus,” not the least remarkable thing about those in New-York bring that (though every man affects to despise titles and rank) they are all named “Lady Clinton,” “Lady Washington,” “Lady Van Rensselaer,” and others as strangely inconsistent. Sometimes, too, servants in half livery may be seen sitting on the box of a carriage, whose door-pannels are ornamented with a crest. This street is about three miles in length, and eighty feet in width, extending in nearly a straight line from one end of the city to the other. The streets are clean for an American city; but the appearance of the cholera had caused the corporation to exert themselves in attending more closely to the cleanliless of them. Some wag observed, in one of the public prints, that the scavengers had actually dug down to the pavement in one or two places, and that the city was cleansed tho-roughly. Manhattan Island, on which the city stands, and which is formed by the Hudson, the Harlæm, and East rivers, with the bay on the south, is fifteen miles in length, and from two to three in breadth. The Old Town, near the bay, much resembles an English one, but the northern part of it is as regularly laid out as Philadelphia or Washington, and numbers about eighty-seven streets. The wharfs are similar to those of Philadelphia, but not quite so ragged, and extend much farther up the east than the Hudson, or North River, as it is generally called, thus depriving the great discoverer of the honour of giving his name to the noble stream. On the south-west point of the island, overlooking the bay, is a fine public promenade, of from 500 to 600 yards in length, and 150 in breadth, prettily laid out in walks, and planted with trees. In the evenings it is generally crowded with citizens, who assemble to derive the benefit from a pleasant breeze off the water, or listen to a band that frequently plays in the Castle garden, which is connected with he walk by a wooden bridge, upon which, and along the whole extent of the public walk, may be seen various Cockney anglers, of most persevering dispositions. The former promenade is called the Battery, from having in the olden times of the Dutch settlers, or during the Revolutionary war, mounted a few guns; and the Castle garden in a similar manner possesses no garden, nor could it ever have possessed one, being a modern stone fort, with twenty-eight embrasures, built upon a solid rock, which appeared but a short distance above the water. This being an unprofitable kind of investment of funds, has been let by the Corporation to a publican, who has converted it to a much more profitable use, charging sixpence sterling for admission, and giving a ticket, so that the visitor may enjoy a stroll upon the upper platform of the fort, admire the view, and then call for a glass of some liquor at the bar, for which he is not charged any thing. The Battery, nevertheless, is the most pleasant promenade in New-York, and far excels any thing else of the kind in America.",130-1,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The town having some high bluff rocks rising at the back of it, is situated at the head of a bay of considerable extent, which affords an excellent shelter from the sea, and a small battery, dignified with the appellation of Fort Hale, occupies a point about two miles up the bay. When within half a mile of the pier, the steamer was boarded by a health officer who expressed himself satisfied with the Captain's word that there were no cholera cases on board; so, being permitted to land, I proceeded to an hotel in a large square called the Green, about three-quarters of a mile in circumference. It has three churches in a line near the centre of it, and at a short distance in another line a state-house (which is almost a fac-simile of the Philadelphian bank and a Methodist chapel; while the opposite side of the square is occupied by the large brick buildings of the Yale College. The square as also the streets of the town (which contains 11,000 inhabitants) are planted with fine elm trees, which keep them, however, exceedingly wet and dirty. The college has four houses. for the lodging of the students, 158 chapels, and a Lycæum (in which are the recitation rooms) and possesses an excellent library. It was commenced in 1700, by the recommendation of eleven of the principal ministers of neighbouring towns, who had been appointed to adopt such measures as they should deem fit for the regulation of a college. Its first commencement was held at Saybrook in 1702, and removed to New Haven in 1717. The Hon. Elihu Yale, Governor of the East India Company, being its principal benefactor, his name was bestowed upon it. It is considered one of the best colleges in the States, and from four to five hundred young men study at it.",137,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are nine or ten churches to 8500 inhabitants; and, on walking out in the afternoon, there was literally not one person to be seen in the streets. Feeling rather ashamed at being apparently the only absentee from divine service, I proceeded a short distance out of the town to the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, which was the first establishment of the kind in the States, and is partly conducted by a gentleman who has the misfortune to be afflicted himself in the same manner. The building is a very extensive one, situated on an eminence overlooking the town, and generally contains from sixty to seventy inmates...The Connecticut River, on whose right bank the town stands, is about 300 yards broad, and connected with the large manufacturing village of East Hartford, one mile distant, by a bridge of seven arches, at which the sloop navigation ceases. The town would be a very handsome one, if a little more attention were paid to the cleanliness of the streets; but, like most American towns, the dirt was six inches deep in them. Grass, rank docks, and other weeds, were growing on every side of the State House and one half the square, which was cut up in every direction, after a heavy shower of rain, by deep ruts and innumerable water-courses.",163-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the eastern bank, it is built at the foot of a range of heights which run parallel with the stream, and upon the summit of them are the two large tasteless buildings of the Brown University. An Englishman's ideas of a college are associated with cloisters, antique piles, and black-lettered volumes, and he would fix the seat of the genius of learning in some venerable pile of building which possessed an air of grandeur. He could scarcely reconcile to himself a four-storied, redpainted, brick house as her abode; and would pardon her for taking alarm and fleeing from such a spot, where too her votaries are distinguished by no classical garb. I believe it is rather the case with this College, which does not bear so high a name as that at Hartford or New-Haven, or Cambridge; but, of all the public buildings in America, I thought the colleges were the most tasteless. Steam-vessels and sloops navigate the river up to the bridges, which connect the two towns; where the stream is considerably contracted by the piers which have been thrown out, but immediately above them it expands again into a fine cove or bay of half a mile in width, with neat houses encircling it. The town containing between 16,000 and 17,000 inhabitants is a manufacturing place of considerable importance, and printed calicoes of very durable colours are struck off. In the cotton works many very young children are employed; but there were propositions (as in England, by Mr. Sadler) to limit the number of working hours.",166,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fort Adams, which is building upon a point of land, and connected with the town by a narrow neck, was commenced five years since, and is likely to take three more to finish it, though 300 workmen are kept in employ: the annual expenditure upon it is nearly 100,000 dollars. Fort Woolcott is situated upon an island in the centre of the harbour, between Fort Adams and the town. There is another fort upon Rose Island, a short distance above the town, at the entrance to the Naraganset River; while a fourth occupies a rocky point called the Dumplings, at the entrance to the bay, opposite to Fort Adams. The town is a fashionable watering place for the southern people, there being a most extensive and beautiful beach upon the opposite side of the neck to that upon which the town is built, and having the additional luxury of a fine sea breeze, which sets in during the summer months from about nine in the morning until sunset. The surrounding country is rather devoid of trees, a complaint which a traveller will not often have to make in America, but so many are rising up round the pretty residences in the vicinity of the town, that in a few years it will be a most attractive place. After making one or two almost ineffectual attempts at taking a sketch of the town, against which I believe there was neither pain nor penalty attached, I again rose, having rested myself for two hours in gazing upon the scene, and, regaining the road, proceeded on my journey, almost wicked enough to wish that the cholera might pay the inhabitants of New-port a visit, in return for their inhospitable conduct to travellers, and those who were seeking a place of refuge.",171-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1630, at its foundation, the Indian name was Shawmut, which was changed to Trimountain, from the three hills upon which it is now built; subsequently it received its present name, in honour of a minister who emigrated from Boston in Lincolnshire. Upon the other sides of the peninsula, communication is kept up with the mainland by several strong wooden bridges varying in length from 1500 to 3500 feet, and on its western side by a pier of solid materials 1½ mile in length, and above 80 feet in width. The bay is a most magnificent one, and equals that of New-York, but in a different style of beauty. The Boston bay is on a much more grand and extensive scale containing 75 square miles and studded with more than 100 islands and rocks, the only ship channel being between Forts Warren and Independence on Governor's and Castle islands. The land which almost encircles the bay is high and cultivated, and numerous towns and villages are scattered over it. When entering the harbour from sea, I think it much more beautiful than New-York. The city rises in a much prettier and more showy form upon its three hills, and the whole is surmounted by the lofty dome of the State House. But then there is no view from any part of Boston to be compared with the bewitching one from the battery in New-York on a still summer's evening. As to literary character, it is the Athens of the western world; the number of its literary publications is very great, being 6 newspapers daily, 4 three times a week, 8 twice a week, and 16 weekly; 2 weekly magazines, 2 semi-monthly, 11 monthly (principally religious,) 4 every two months, 5 quarterly, and 1 semi-annually; and 4 new-year annuals;—in addition to which the British Quarterly Review is re-printed. As an historical spot, it ranks far above all others in the west, having been the birth-place of American Independence; and, the city having arrived to maturity before that event took place, it more resembles an English one than any other in the States. I had become rather weary of straight streets, which, though in some respects convenient, are tiresomely monotonous to a stranger, and was glad to be once again walking in those of a description I had been most accustomed to. The environs are more pleasing also than those of Philadelphia and New York; the country being intersected with delightful rides, every one of which affords some fine view. The “common” in which the State House is situated is an open park, containing 75 acres of broken and abrupt ground, with a promenade and double row of fine trees round it. It was reserved in perpetuum by the first settlers for a parade-ground, or other public purposes, and is surrounded upon three sides by elegant private dwellings and several churches, the fourth side being open to a wide bay. There is a fine drooping old elm in the centre of it, near a serpentine sheet of water, which the inhabitants are taking every possible pains to preserve, by binding the large, broad, spreading branches, and connecting them with each other by strong belts and bars of iron. The State House, at one corner of the common, is on elevated ground, 30 feet higher than the street, from which a broad flight of steps leads to the great hall of 50 feet in length and breadth, and 20 high, which, with the treasurer's, adjutant, and quarter-master general's offices, occupies the lower story. In a building attached to the basement story is a marble statue of Washington, executed by Chantrey at a cost of 15,000 dollars (3100 l. sterling,) and considered, by those who knew the original at the time. of life it is intended to represent, a most striking and admirable likeness. The figure is concealed by the Roman toga, supported over the breast by the left hand; while the right, pendent at the side, holds a scroll; it is placed upon a high pedestal, which (proh pudor!) is surrounded on every side by the stains of squirted tobacco juice. It is well that a strong iron railing prevents visitors from approaching with in less than seven feet, or the statue itself would be barely sacred from such a filthy pollution. The second story contains the fine and spacious Representanve's Room, and Senate Chamber; from the dome, which is 230 feet above the level of the sea, a most extensive view presents itself of the beautiful harbour and surrounding country. The exterior of the building, at a distance, is a striking object; but, upon closer inspection, it is found to be constructed merely of the common brick, painted white. The entrance being through an arched front, which supports a colonnade of Corinthian columns, extending 94 feet, the full length of the centre of the building, has a handsome appearance, but the two wings, 40 feet each in length, look extremely bare, and might be much improved in architectural beauty. The Mason's Hall, on the opposite side of the Common, isa fine granite building, with Gothic windows and towers; and the Park Church near it has a highly ornamental and light spire.",180-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the only one in the country, and is formed of hewn granite upwards of 300 feet in length and 80 in width; the chamber intended for line-of-battle ships to lie in is 200 feet in length, by 18 or 20 in depth. It has double gates, an outer one being required to break the motion of the sea. Two line-of-battle ships and a large frigate were drawn up under cover of the sheds, and three other vessels of war lay alongside the pier. The vessels on the stocks were in the same state of forwardness as those at the other Navy-yards, and could be prepared for sea in a few weeks. Not a workman was employed about any of three line-of battle ships and four frigates which I saw on the stocks at Washington, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and Charlestown, though much work was in progress connected with other branches of the navy. Within a short distance of the Navy-yard is Breed's Hill, upon which the memorable battle of the 17th of June, 1775, was fought; and generally known by the name of Bunker's Hill, which lies half a mile to the north west, at the entrance of the narrow neck of the peninsula. Being sixty feet higher than Breed's Hill, it was the intention of the American general to defend it; but the officer entrusted with the charge of the troops, through some mistake, led them to the one on the point of the peninsula, within range of the British batteries upon Copp's Hill in Boston. The redoubt which 185 they threw up during the night, being attacked the following day by the royal troops under the command of Generals Howe and Pigot, was carried with great slaughter, after a most determined resistance on the part of the revolutionists. In the redoubt, on the summit of the hill, and on the spot where General Warren fell, a monument was commenced on the 17th of June, 1825; the corner stone was laid by Lafayette, but was subsequently taken up and relaid, the foundation not being deep enough to resistthe action of the frost. For the last three or four years no farther progress has been made, though the entire side of the hill is covered with the requisite materials; want of funds is the reason advanced for not finishing it; but a stranger would imagine that such a city as Boston might in itself contribute more than the requisite sum: at present it is but a monument of the inhabitants' want of spirit. The design is upon a grand scale; an obelisk of granite, 50 feet in diameter at the base, and 220 feet in height. No one would wish to deprive the Americans of the honour of their victories; but I never met one yet who did not claim Bunker's Hill as a splendid triumph over the British arms. In arguing the matter, I always referred them to their own histories of the war, which have the candour to acknowledge that the provincialists retired from the position, after making a resistance even longer than prudence admitted. The works of the Americans to this day prove how ably they blockaded the town, and a series of strong redoubts and entrenchments may be easily traced for a distance of fifteen miles, from Dorchester Heights on the margin of the Bay to Winter Hill on the Mystic River.",184,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wooden bridge half a mile in length, crosses the river into the prettiest of American towns, Northampton. Nowhere did I see such beautiful villages as in New England, of which Concord in New Hampshire, Worcester and Northampton, rank pre-eminent. The situation of this last is a charming one, in a rich country, upon a noble river, and steam navigation to the ocean. The streets are unlike any thing English. Frame houses possess a neatness 191 and cleanliness of appearance which it is impossible to impart to our heavy town abodes; and, as the material of which they are built can be moulded into more elegant forms, the American houses are generally ornamented with light balconies and porticos, supported by columns of the Doric or Corinthian order. I thought Northampton the most delightful and enviable place I had ever seen; it is the very realization of a “ rus in urbe ,” the streets being so thickly planted with trees of a primeval growth that their boughs are almost interwoven across the road, and the neat private dwellings and shops beneath them appear like a series of cottages and gardens. The town has been settled nearly 180 years, and contains above 2000 inhabitants. On the opposite side of the river, which is crossed at South Hadley by a horse ferry, two miles distant, is Mount Holyoke, 1070 feet above the level of the river, and a favourite resort of travellers and parties of pleasure. Seven carriages, filled principally with ladies, arrived at the foot of the mount at the same time as myself. The road winds along the side of it through a dense forest of trees, until within 400 feet of the summit, where it is necessary to dismount and clamber over rough loose stones and logs of wood for the remaining distance. But the scene which bursts upon the spectator's view, as he steps upon the bare black rock on the summit— a scene of sublime beauty, of which but an inadequate description could be conveyed— amply repays him for his trouble and fatigue. A more charming day could not have been desired: it was one of those clear American atmospheres which are unknown in our own hazy clime, with just sufficient light floating clouds to throw a momentary shadow over parts of the rich vale, which lay spread out beneath in all the various hues of a quickly ripening harvest. Innumerable white houses, and spires of churches, were seen scattered amongst the trees and along the banks of the smooth but rapid Connecticut (up which a solitary steamer was slowly creeping,) which river in its fantastic and capricious windings returned within a few yards of the same spot, after watering two or three miles of the vale —or, after being concealed at intervals by the hills and woods, would again appear with its silvery surface glistening amidst the dark foliage at the distance of many miles. These objects, and above all, the high and rocky mountains, contrasted with the smiling valleys, altogether formed one of the most magnificent panoramas in the world. Places 160 miles apart from each other were distinctly visible. I soon recognized the bluff rocks near New-Haven, at eighty miles distance, though only 400 feet in height, and could easily trace their rugged and bold outline upon the clear horizon.",190-1,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The city, containing about 12,000 inhabitants; occupies an alluvial plain of some extent between the mount and the Hudson River. Having some spare time, I walked through several of the streets, and visited the Episcopal Church, which has a very tasteful Gothic tower: one of the prettiest specimens of architecture I saw in the United States; but the body of the church, not being built in unison with it, gives the edifice the air of a piece of patch-work. An elegant and large Court-house was completed, with the exception of its portico, in a street adjoining the church; but it bore too strong a resemblance to the United States' Bank at Philadelphia, of which I had since seen so many fac-similes, to have man charms for me. The building was entirely of white marble, and modelled after the temple of Theseus at Athens. The gallant “Trojans,” as the inhabitants call themselves, were partaking of the New York panic, and leaving the city in crowds, on account of few cases of cholera being reported.",205-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From this place to Schenectady the country is dull, uninteresting in point of scenery, and devoid of habitations; but now, having gained the banks of the Mohawk River, a rich alluvial soil presents itself. There is but little worthy of notice in the town, excepting Union College, on an eminence near the road from Troy. Only two large buildings, forming part of what is intended, are at present erected; but several more are to be immediately added, and, the adjoining grounds being spacious, it promises to become a pretty spot. The college has been very liberally endowed by the State to the amount of 300,000 dollars, and the number of students at this time is about 200. Dr. Nott, the President, is not only a good classical scholar, but an excellent and persevering mechanic. Some of his inventions have even gained a considerable name in England, amongst which is an improvement in hot air stoves for heating cathedrals and large buildings. He has expended also large sums of money in experiments upon steamvessels; several of which are constructing upon his plan of having twenty small boilers, instead of two or four large ones, and are considered safer than those generally in use, and equally swift.",206,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/0265a/0265a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the completion of that work, it has augmented to 10,000 souls, and is daily on the increase. The line of canal, which eight years since was on the outskirts, now passes directly through the centre of the city, giving it a pleasing appearance, to which the innumerable wooden bridges with, their light open railing greatly contribute. The inhabitants are well aware of its rising importance, predicting already that the State Government will be removed from Albany, and that the future laws will emanate from their capitol, whose site they have marked out in a square at the upper end of the city, on a rising eminence, whence its dome will be seen by the surrounding country for forty miles. The streets are also laid out in a style befitting the capital of the most populous State in the Union. As a central situation it is more convenient than Albany, which is on the very confines of the State, and three hundred miles from the inhabitants of the western parts of it. A stranger, seeing no manufactories or large mercantile establishments in Utica, finds it difficult to account for its rapid increase, until he discovers that every stream from the neighbouring hills is covered with such speculations, and the margin of every creek is peopled.
