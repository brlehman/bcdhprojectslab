There are several large stores in this town, which appears to be rapidly increasing. Our course now lay along the Illinois, the scenery of which is extremely beautiful, indeed superior to any of the kind which I had seen. The rocks rise abruptly from the valley of the river, at the distance of quarter of a mile on either side; some protruded here and there from the bed of the stream; the slopes were covered with wood, the foliage of which exhibited the most glowing tints of red and yellow; and the shrubs and herbage of the lower ground presented forms as beautiful as they were new to me. I have little doubt, that when the scenery of Ottawa is properly known and appreciated, it will be visited by crowds. About a mile below it, a town has been planned, which is to be named Gibraltar, on account of the abrupt rocks which rise in its vicinity. The grass on the flat land attains a height of six, or even sometimes nine feet, and in the waggon we were in a manner completely overtopped by it over a space of nearly three miles.",108-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On an eminence nearly an hundred feet high, with an almost perpendicular front, is a castle, strongly fortified, and facing the harbour, which has so narrow an entrance as to permit only one vessel to enter at a time, and is completely protected by the guns of the fort, which extend nearly a quarter of a mile along its side. Opposite to this fort is another, nearly on a level with the water, and from which, on the south side, the town stretches along the harbour, which is nearly a mile in length, and gradually enlarges, so as to form at its upper part a large basin, in which an hundred vessels may ride at anchor in perfect security, the water being deep, and complete shelter being afforded by the rising ground all round. The town stretches away from the harbour to some distance; its streets are narrow, parallel, and intersecting; and almost all the houses are of two stories, and castellated, so as greatly to add to the effect of the scenery.",198-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several ships of war were at anchor off Port-Royal...There is only one respectable tavern, and there the accommodations are inferior, and the charges most immoderate, from three to four dollars being taken for dinner alone. The lodgings, however, are very good, although the charges are very high, four dollars a week being taken, five shillings for breakfast, and six shillings and eightpence for dinner. The houses in the principal streets are detached, generally of two stories, and built of wood, with verandahs and flower-plots in front. The streets are wide, but very sandy, and not well kept.... The ground between the road and the harbour is marshy, and must in dry weather render Kingston very unhealthy, though for several years past there has been little fever there. A few villas, almost all wooden, were seen on the other side.",222-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From an eminence above the town there is a good viewer of it, and of the adjacent country, which is bounded by hills. The houses are generally good, and there are several taverns, of which the largest and most commodious is the Montgomery Arms. For a bottle of Scotch ale I was here charged a dollar, the landlord having told me before drawing the cork that I could not have it for less. The river is navigable for steamers drawing three feet of water, as far up as Wetumptka, which is 400 miles distant from Mobile.",175-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26860/26860.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
