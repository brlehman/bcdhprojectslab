On one side lay the city, its outskirts extending on either side into the hills; while the wide expanse of the harbour, with its numerous inlets and islands, lay stretched out in front of it, seemingly landlocked, and resembling a large lake, surrounded by a background of green hills. Auckland is picturesquely situated in the North Island of New Zealand, at a point where its breadth is only six miles; and possesses two fine harbours. Waitemata, the principal of these, and along the shores of which the city is built, is very fine, and one of the safest in New Zealand. It is an inlet of the Firth of Thames, and consists of an inner harbour, almost landlocked by Rangitoto and Tapu Islands, containing good wharfage accommodation; and an outer bay of considerable extent, called Hauraki Gulf, protected by the Great and Little Barrier Islands. On the western side of North Island, and distant only six miles from Auckland, with which it is connected by a tramway, is Manukau harbour, on which is situated the small town of Onehunga, and from which most of the intercolonial trade is carried on. Auckland is regularly laid out, the streets being straight and wide, and crossing one another at right angles. Queen Street, the principal thoroughfare, extends a distance of a couple of miles from the wharves, and contains the principal buildings. The public buildings are generally good, built for the most part of brick, faced with stone; the most important being the Government Offices, the Post Office and Custom House, and the Supreme Court. Government House is a handsome edifice, erected on an eminence which commands a grand view of the harbour, and situated in the midst of ornamental grounds, containing many fine trees. Auckland contains something under 25,000 inhabitants. It is the second city in New Zealand, in point of population and commercial importance, and was, until 1865, the political capital of the colony; when it was found advisable to select a town with a more central position for the seat of Government, and the Legislature was removed to Wellington. Auckland has lost, in consequence, some of its former importance; but, from its unrivalled position, seems destined to become a great city, especially when the large tract of country occupied by the Maoris is brought under cultivation, and the railway system extended throughout the Island. It is at present a busy thriving place, and is rendered more characteristic of the country than other New Zealand towns by the number of the Aborigines or Maoris seen in its streets.",4-Feb,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Its appearance, viewed from the harbour, is remarkably picturesque, being embowered in luxuriant vegetation, with a background of volcanic hills of most irregular shapes, their sides covered with verdure, and their craggy peaks rising to a great height. In rear of the town is a peculiarly-shaped eminence called Punchbowl Hill, the summit of which is crowned by a small battery, to protect the harbour. The harbour consists of a roadstead and an inner basin; the former protected by a spit of land extending into the sea, called Diamond Head, and the latter accommodating at its wharves ships of very large tonnage—our steamer, a vessel of 3,200 tons register, being very comfortably berthed. The entrance to the harbour, as in most of the islands in the Pacific, is through a passage in the coral reef that extends round the island of Oahu. These passages through the reefs are supposed to be formed by currents of cold fresh water coming from the land, in which the coral insects that build up these reefs upon submerged portions of the islands cannot exist. Honolulu consists of regularly laid out streets, that have, however, more the appearance of wide, rural lanes, from the luxuriance of the vegetation in the gardens, and the number of beautiful trees standing between the houses. It contains some good public buildings, amongst which it is pleasing to see a public library, with 1,500 books of reference, and numerous churches. The king's palace is a plain unpretentious building of coral-stone, situated on about an acre of well laid out ground, surrounded by a high wall, at the entrance gate in which stands a native sentry, in his neat uniform of blue coat and white trousers.",15-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

It lies at the foot of high hills, which, in the early days of the city, were cut up by numerous gullies, and the low land at their base was of small extent. Many of these hills have been levelled, the gullies filled up, and the narrow portion of the peninsula widened with land reclaimed from the ocean; thus there are now paved streets and busy thoroughfares, where once large ships rode at anchor. The city is regularly laid out, the streets being straight, broad, and crossing one another at right angles; the business portion is compactly built, and may be said to cover an area of nine square miles, lying between Telegraph, Rincon, and Russian Hills. It is substantially built, for the greater part, of stone; but the outskirts are straggling, the houses being wide apart, and generally of wood. The rapid growth of San Francisco is almost unprecedented, equalled only by that of Melbourne, Victoria, which owes its rise to the same cause, viz., the gold discoveries. The first house built on the present site of the city was in 1835, when the settlement was called Terba Buena, from a medicinal herb found in the vicinity; this was changed to its present name, San Francisco, in 1847. In 1848, when gold was first discovered, the population amounted to 1,000; the great immigration from the East then set in, and in 1850 the population had increased to 25,000; in 1860, to 57,000; in 1870, to 150,000; and is now estimated at over 175,000 inhabitants....The principal thoroughfare is Montgomery-street, which, with its fine blocks of buildings, is a very handsome street. It extends at its northern extremity to the top of a hill, too precipitous for carriages to ascend; but pedestrians can do so by means of a flight of steps, and from the top a fine view of the city and bay is obtained. Market and Kearneystreets are also fine thoroughfares, and contain many of the best retail establishments. In California-street are the principal banks and brokers' offices; whilst Front, Sansome, and Battery-streets form the centre of the wholesale trade of the city. The best private residences are situated in Van Ness Avenue, Pine-street Hill, Bush and Geary-streets. The traffic in some of these streets is very great, and forcibly reminds one of parts of the city of London.",22-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

It is situated at the head of navigation on the Sacramento River, near its confluence with the great American river; and is distant about 125 miles from the Pacific. It very much resembles a large colonial up-country town, and is the seat of some rather extensive manufactures. It is a thriving and busy place, and, during the sessions of the State Legislature, swarms with numbers of political agents and hangers-on. The Capitol, or State House, is a noble building, in the Corinthian style of architecture, surmounted by a grand cupola, which renders it a very conspicuous object, from every point of the surrounding plains. It is, unquestionably, one of the finest edifices in the United States. Sacramento is the centre of a large railway system, and from it, lines radiate to all parts of the State; hence it seems likely in time, to become a large and important city. The streets are broad and well paved, and lined with trees, which form an agreeable shade in summer. The houses are generally built of brick, and have a substantial and pleasing look; whilst the recent erections are really handsome in appearance.",34-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

A storm in these mountains, witnessed from the city, is a grand sight. Two peaks or summits, called the Twin Peaks, distant about 15 miles southeasterly, are 11,000 feet high, and have never been free from snow since the settlement in this valley. Salt Lake, that veritable Dead Sea, is 120 miles long, by about 45 miles broad, and contains seven islands. Its waters are so salt that nothing can live in them, and the fish that find their way down the rivers Jordan, and Weber, are soon killed. It is said, that enough salt to supply the whole world, could be obtained by evaporation. I took a sail on
 the lake, but found its banks destitute of vegetation, and its dreary, barren, appearance uninviting. The rivers Jordan and Weber empty themselves into the lake, but there is no outlet; and the waters are said to have risen some 10 feet since 1850. A peculiar feature of Salt Lake is two rocks: one, a great mass, rising abruptly out of the water, and standing black and desolate, called Black Rock; the other, overhanging the margin, and bearing an indistinct resemblance to a human face, is called Profile Rock. Salt Lake City is situated at the foot of the Wahsatch Mountains, on a plain that has, by indomitable perseverance and toil, been converted from a wilderness, impregnated with alkali, and productive only of sagebush, into a smiling agricultural country, dotted over with the farms, or, as they are here called, the “ranches” of the settlers. A slight description of this most remarkable city may not be out of place, before I proceed to give an account of the people who inhabit it, and of the territory in which it is situated. Salt Lake City is regularly laid out in the form of the letter L; the larger portion stretching east and west, and the shorter north and south. The streets—as is usual in all new American towns—are wide, cross one another at right angles, and follow the cardinal points of the compass; but they possess an unique appearance, as they have brooks of clear water flowing down either side, and watering the roots of trees, planted so, as to cast a pleasant shade over the pathway. These shade-trees, bordering every thoroughfare, and the numerous orchards in, and around the city, give it the appearance of being embowered in foliage—very refreshing to the eye in the hot season. The city is laid out in square blocks of ten acres each, covers a space of about nine square miles, and contains a population of some 25,000 inhabitants; 20,000 of whom are Mormons, and the remainder Gentiles—as all are called who do not profess the faith of Mormon.",43-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

In 1830, it was only a trading station with the Indians, consisting at thattime of a few log houses only; and the city has attained its present proportions, since that comparatively recent date. What causes it, however, to be regarded as the most remarkable city in the world, is the fact, that since the great fire of 1871, the greatest conflagration of modern times—in which three and a half square miles of the principal part of the city were burned; in which 17,450 buildings were destroyed, and 98,000 people rendered homeless; the monetary loss of which, was estimated at little short of thirtyseven millions sterling, ten millions only of which, were coveredMby insurance—the city has sprung up like a phoenix out of its ashes, and now shows but few traces of the dire calamity. The buildings destroyed, have all been replaced by noble stone edifices; so that now Chicago may justly claim to be a “City of Palaces.” In 1874, another fire broke out in the devoted city, and six hundred acres of buildings were consumed; yet, in spite of these disastrous drawbacks, Chicago exhibits but few remains of either devastation. The position of the city is most favourable, being situated mid-way between the Eastern and Western States; on Lake Michigan, which gives it a splendid water-way. It is also the centre of a vast railway system, and has in consequence become the greatest grain emporium in the world, and also the largest cattle and lumber market. It has not been without straining every nerve, that the city has been rebuilt in such an incalculably short time; house rents are very high in consequence, and ratepayers obtain some concession, by paying their rates in advance. Chicago is well laid out, the streets being generally eighty feet wide; some of them are from three to seven miles in length, run due north to south, and east to west, and cross one another at right angles. The Chicago River runs through the city, and with its two branches, divides it into three parts; between which, communication is effected by means of thirty-three bridges. These bridges swing on central pivots, and have to be opened to allow vessels to pass; but as this is found to interrupt the street traffic, they are commencing to build tunnels, under the bed of the river. Two have already been completed; one connects the northern and western divisions of the city, and is 1,600 feet long; the other joins the northern and southern, and is 1,900 feet in length.",69-71,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Detroit is the principal city of Michigan, and contains some 100,000 inhabitants; the river front for miles is lined with warehouses, dry-docks, shipbuilding yards, founderies, and grain-elevators; and the city is laid out on the usual American rectangular plan. The streets are broad; those containing the business premises vary from 50 to 100 feet in width; the avenues of private mansions from 100 to 200 feet. They are generally planted, with a double row of trees on both sides, and these beech, chestnut, oak, elm, and maple trees, all covered with foliage, give a pretty countrified appearance to the city, and form a most agreeable shade. The Campus Martius, a fine open space or square, is the principal feature in the arrangement of the city. Taking up the whole side of this square stands the City Hall, a noble stone building in the Italian style; consisting of three stories, above the basement, and surmounted by a Mansard roof. In the middle of the square is the Soldier's Monument; erected in memory of the Michigan soldiers who fell in the civil war. On the north side of the Campus Martius is the Opera House, one of the largest buildings of the kind, in the country. This square is crossed by Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and from it radiate Munroe Avenue and Fort-street. These avenues, for miles, are lined on both sides with detached, and semi-detached houses, each standing in its own garden. In the centre of the city is a semicircular park, called the Grand Circus, which is divided in two by Woodward Avenue, each part containing a fine fountain. The principal buildings are the Custom House, and Post Office, both under the same roof, and the Board of Trade. The Great Wheat Elevator of the Michigan Central Railway Company is a large building, from the cupola of which a grand view is obtained of the city, river, and Lakes St. Clair and Erie. The manufactures of the city are rather extensive, comprising ironworks, machine-shops for the construction of railway rolling-stock; flour mills, breweries, and extensive tobacco and cigar factories; the shipping interests are also large.

The city has a very English appearance, and the streets, though not wide, are generally well paved. The principal are King and Yonge streets, which contain all the best retail establishments. Front street, containing large blocks of warehouses, is also a fine thoroughfare. The University of Toronto is a grand edifice, in the pure Norman style of architecture; the buildings forming three sides of a quadrangle. It is a noble institution, and one of which Canadians may justly be proud; it possesses a library of 20,000 volumes, and a fine museum of natural history. Adjoining the University is the Queen's Park, comprising fifty acres of well laid out ground; approached by long avenues of chestnut, beech, elm, and oak trees. In the park is a fine monument, surmounted by a large figure of Britannia; erected to the memory of those Canadians, who fell in repelling the Fenian invasion of 1866. The Post Office, built in the Ionic style, is a fine building; the City Hall is plain and unpretentious; the Custom House and Court House are handsome structures. Osgoode Hall is a very imposing, and extensive building of the Ionic Order; it contains the Provincial Courts, and has a fine law library. Amongst other buildings of a public character may be enumerated St. Lawrence Hall, the Masonic Hall, and the Exchange. Toronto is to Canada, what Edinburgh is to Scotland, the seat of its higher educational system; and contains many fine public schools, and colleges. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, is one of the principal, and most successful. Trinity College is a spacious building, with numerous turrets and quaint gables; and is situated in the midst of extensive grounds.

It is situated on the Island of Montreal, which is thirty miles long, and ten broad, and is formed by the junction of the Ottawa, with the St. Lawrence. It is connected with the main land, by the splendid Victoria Bridge, called by Montrealers “the eighth wonder of the world.” This celebrated bridge is a mile and a half long, or with its approaches, nearly two miles; is supported upon twenty-four piers, and two abutments of solid masonry; the span between the centre piers being thirty-three feet. The iron tube, through which the lines are laid, is twenty-two feet high, and sixteen feet wide. This bridge ,was erected by Robert Stephenson, and though rather an eyesore, obstructing as it does, the view of the noble river; is the only means of traffic with the mainland, when the river being frozen over, navigation is impeded. The city is laid out very much like an old French town, but has of late been much improved; the streets are gradually being widened; and the city with its fine blocks of buildings, and its numerous public edifices, looks substantial, and shows the evidences of great accumulated wealth. The Quays are very fine; built entirely of solid limestone, and extending for several miles, undisfigured by unsightly warehouses, and stores, as is unfortunately so often the case. At a short distance from the city is the Mont Real, which gives to the city its name of Montreal, now used in place of the ancient Indian one Hochelaga. From the summit of this beautiful eminence, a magnificent panorama is presented of the city, with its noble quays, and glittering spires. From it can also be seen, the great St. Lawrence, as it winds its way, for miles, through a gently undulating plain, dotted with pretty little villages. This “mountain,” as it is locally called, is a general recreation ground for the people of Montreal; and round the base, and winding around the hill, are beautiful drives. St. James, and Notre Dame streets, are the principal promenades, and contain the best retail establishments. St. Paul street, fronting the quays, and extending their entire length, is the principal commercial thoroughfare; whilst other smaller streets, branching off these main arteries, contain large blocks of warehouses.

These river steamers are most commodious, and beautifully fitted up; and form, in the warm weather, a far more agreeable mode of travelling, than the dusty railway cars. The first appearance of Quebec from the river is very grand; here the banks rise precipitously, and are covered with fine trees, nestling amongst which are numerous private residences. The river widens considerably, and is commanded by the guns of the citadel, perched high up on the height; from which the ramparts extend round the city, rendering it so strong a fortress, that it has been called the “Gibraltar of America.” Since the regular troops who garrisoned it were recalled, and the charge of the fortress assumed by the Canadian Government; the ramparts are falling into decay, and the guns rusting. The British Government commenced the building of three powerful forts on Point Levi, opposite to Quebec, on the other side of the river; but left them in an incomplete state, and nothing has been done by the Canadian Government to finish them. It would consequently not be a difficult matter, for an enterprising enemy, to carry Quebec, as it stands, by a coup de main; and this fortress, formerly considered impregnable, in the hands of an enemy commanding the navigation of the St. Lawrence, would virtually place Canada at his feet...The streets of Quebec are very narrow, and steep; especially those connecting the Upper, with the Lower Town. A large portion of the Upper Town is taken up by the buildings of the great religious corporations of the dominant denomination; such as the Seminary, Laval University, the Ursulines, the Hôtel Dieu, and the ancient Jesuit College; which latter has more recently been used as a barracks. Over the remaining portion of Upper Town, not taken up by the fortifications, are crowded the quaint, mediæval streets, and houses; the latter built generally of stone, two storeys high, and roofed with a shining tin, which gives the city, when the sun shines on it, a very glittering appearance. The Lower Town is the oldest, and most important; here are clustered at the foot of the promontory, under the guns of the grand battery, 200 feet above, the principal wharves, ferry-landings, commercial houses, and banks.",98-100,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

This stream flows through thickly-wooded country, with extensive saw-mills on the banks, for the conversion of pine logs into planks, etc. Ottawa is situated on the river of that name, at its junction with the Rideau; the city being on a hill, between the two rivers, and divided into the Upper and Lower Town, by the Rideau Canal. It has a population of 25,000; is the centre of the lumber trade of the Ottawa and its tributaries; and otherwise possesses some extensive flour-mills, and manufactories of agricultural implements, mill machinery, &c. Facing it, on the opposite side of the river, are the suburbs of Hull, and New Edinburgh, connected with the city by several bridges. The great feature, however, of Ottawa, is that imposing pile, or rather piles of building,— forming as they do three sides of a quadrangle,—occupied as the Parliament Houses and Government Offices. These buildings are situated on a hill, descending abruptly to the river; are built in the Italian Gothic style; and, with their irregular towers, and pinnacles glittering in the sun, form as imposing a structure, as is to be seen in America. The south side of the quadrangle is formed by the Houses of Parliament; whilst the east and west sides, are taken up by the Departmental Offices. The two wings containing the latter, are quite detached from the front, forming the Parliament Houses; and there are thus three distinct blocks of building, which together form a pile, of which Canadians may justly be proud; and a fit abode, for the Legislature of the great colony. The interior of the Houses of Parliament is very fine; the Chambers for the two branches of the Legislature have beautiful stained glass windows, but are still very light. The Chamber of the Commons, to my mind, is far handsomer than its prototype at Westminster; but like it, its acoustic properties are bad. Facing the Speaker's chair is a fine statue of Her Majesty, and busts of the Prince and Princess of Wales; and the corridors contain portraits of former Speakers. The Parliament Library is a handsome structure, containing forty thousand volumes. The most important edifice in the city, after the Government buildings, is the Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame. This is a large stone building, with two spires covered with shining tin,—poor in style,—but having a very picturesque appearance, when seen from a distance. The scenery in the vicinity is very beautiful; consisting of well-timbered country, watered by several rivers, interspersed with numerous waterfalls. The principal of these are the Falls of the Chaudiére, and the Rideau; the former being especially beautiful.",103-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

This fort was built by the French in 1756, and was named by them Carillon; but this has been supplanted by its present Indian appellation of Ticonderoga, which signifies “noisy,” so called from the Falls in the vicinity. Though now a ruin, it has been the scene of many a fierce struggle in former times. In 1758, it was attacked by an English force of 16,000 men, under Abercrombie, who was however repulsed, with a loss of 2,000 men; but in the following year, it was abandoned by the French, and taken possession of by the British. Ticonderoga has been held successively by the French, the British, the French again, the American Colonists, and was finally reduced by General Burgoyne; when it remained in the hands of the British, until the termination of the revolutionary war, and was then ceded to the Americans. The scenery in the vicinity of this old fortress is very beautiful, and the drive of four miles along the sparkling stream, that connects Lake Champlain with Lake George, is delightful. This turbulent little stream, has a descent of 230 feet; in the course of which, there are two series of lovely cascades, called the Falls of Ticonderoga. The romantic beauty of these, is however, marred by the factories that have been erected along the banks, near the villages of Alexandria and Ticonderoga. The scenery however, varies continually; and openings in the foliage, reveal vistas of the lake, with the hills and valleys of Vermont in the background; whilst the little stream foams, and tumbles, beside us, presenting at every turn, new and beautiful combinations, of rock draped with rich verdure, the colours of which harmonize beautifully with the dark blue of the lake, glimpses of which we are continually obtaining.",118-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

The hotels are colossal; the principal being the Grand Union, the Congress Hall, and the United States, which are only open for four months out of the year, and will alone repay a visit to Saratoga. The Grand Union has over a mile in length of piazzas, two miles of halls, ten acres of carpets, and eight hundred bedrooms. These hotels are, in spite of their great size, very comfortable; and their proprietors cater for the amusement of their guests, during the season, by having good bands, and balls every night. They will each accommodate from a thousand to fifteen hundred guests. The arrivals at Saratoga, during the season, often amount to a thousand daily. And now a few words about the Springs, which are chalybeate or acidulous saline, according to the relative proportion of their particles; the constituent ones being carbonate of soda, chloride of sodium, carbonate of magnesia, hydriodate of soda, silica and alumina, carbonic acid gas, with occasional traces of iodine and potassa. The principal are Congress and Columbia Springs, both situated in a tastefully laid out little park, and over them elegant light structures have been erected; Excelsior Spring, situated in Excelsior Park; High Rock Spring, situated on the top of a rock, whence its name; the Hamilton and Hathorn Springs, in the centre of the town; the Washington, United States, and Empire Springs; Red Spring, so called from the colour of its waters when agitated; the Star, Eureka, and White Sulphur Springs. Putnam Spring is used for bathing purposes, being chalybeate. The most remarkable is the Geyser, or Spouting Spring, the waters of which spout up high in the air, through a shaft sunk 140 feet through the solid rock; and are very saline, and only fourteen degrees above zero. The Glacier Spring is another geyser, in close proximity to it. Life in Saratoga, in the great hotels, may be summed up in a few words. It is ephemeral, only lasting a couple of months; and during that period wealth, beauty, fashion, and other
 ingredients not so desirable, meet and intermingle, in the whirl and excitement of the
 ballroom at night; visits to the Springs in the morning; and promenades or drives, in the
 afternoon....",124-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

It was founded by the Dutch in 1612, and named by them Williamstadt, until 1664, when it fell into the hands of the British, and was re-named by them Albany, in honour of the Duke of York and Albany, afterwards James II. The city has a population of 80,000, and is a place of great commercial importance, from its position on the Hudson, and its proximity to the great Erie and Champlain Canals; the former of which gives it the command of a fine water-way to the west; and the latter, facilities of cheap water carriage to the north. It is also the centre of a large railway system. Albany is situated on a high ridge, and with its numerous spires, presents a very imposing appearance, when seen from the opposite side of the river. Statestreet, its principal thoroughfare, ascends from the water's edge to the height, on which stand the Capitol, and principal public buildings. The present State House is a plain, unpretentious building; but the new Capitol now in course of erection, in close proximity to it, will be, when completed, the finest edifice in the whole country; with the exception alone of the Federal Capitol at Washington. The State Library is a fine building, containing 90,000 volumes; and amongst other historical relics and curiosities, the original Arnold and André Correspondence. The City Hall is a beautiful white marble structure, with a fine portico, supported upon six Ionic columns. Albany possesses several public libraries, museums, and establishments devoted to educational purposes; amongst the latter may be mentioned the Normal School, for the training of teachers.

It also takes up a portion of the mainland, and three small islands in East River—viz., Randall's, Ward's, and Blackwell's. The area of New York is forty-one and a half square miles, of which twentyone and a half are on Manhattan Island, nineteen on the mainland, and about three quarters of a mile on the smaller islands.

The city proper covers a peninsula only 700 acres in extent, and is consequently very closely built upon. East Boston occupies Maverick's Island, and having the greatest depth of water, at its wharves lie all the ocean steamers, and vessels of large draught. Some of these wharves are of considerable extent, that belonging to the Cunard Company being over 1,000 feet long. South Boston extends for about two miles along the south side of the harbour, by an arm of which, it is separated from Boston proper. The city is connected with Charlestown, one of its suburbs, by the Charles river bridge 1,5000 feet long; and with Cambridge, another of its suburbs, by the West Boston bridge 2,750 feet in length. The harbour covers an area of about seventy-five square miles, and is studded with numerous islands, which give it a very picturesque appearance. It is memorable for having been the scene of the occurrence, that led to the battle on the neighbouring heights of Bunker Hill, the actual beginning of the Revolutionary War, the results of which have been perhaps more important, than those of any other historical event. This occurrence, as is well-known, was the destruction, by a party of Bostonians disguised as Indians, of the obnoxious tea, attempted by the Home Government of the,day to be forced upon the colonists. Boston is one of the oldest cities in the States, having been founded in 1625, a few years after the settlement of New York. In 1872, it was the scene of an immense conflagration, which caused great devastation, destroying about 800 of the best buildings, which have however in an incredibly short space of time, been replaced by other, and better edifices. It is very much like an English provincial city in appearance, and is without doubt the most old-fashioned town in the States; the streets being mostly narrow and crooked, especially in the older part. Washington and Tremont Streets are the principal business thoroughfares, and contain many fine shops, and other buildings. Since the fire the streets generally have been widened, and otherwise improved. Boston has often been called the “Athens of America,” from Harvard University, the most ancient seat of learning in the country, being in its immediate vicinity; and from its possessing many other institutions devoted to higher learning. The pride of its New England inhabitants is proverbial, and was exemplified after the great conflagration; when Chicago and other towns collected by voluntary contribution, and forwarded a sum of £40,000, for the use of the people rendered homeless; which the Bostonians refused to accept, on the plea that they were rich enough to support their own poor. The public buildings of Boston are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; the most prominent are the State House, and the City Hall. The former is a building in the Grecian style of architecture, with an imposing colonnade in front, and surmounted by a gilded dome. The entrance leads directly into the Rotunda, in which are a fine statue of Washington, busts of former-governors, and trophies of banners and cannon. The City Hall is an imposing building of white granite, in the Italian Renaissance style, with a fine louvre dome. On the lawn in front is a fine bronze statue of Franklin.",153-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

It is one of the prettiest of the many pretty New England towns, lying in the valley of the Connecticut River, at the head of its navigation and junction with Park River; the country in the vicinity being rich, cultivated plains, interspersed with well-wooded hills, and dotted with villages and homesteads. The town itself is regularly laid out, some of the streets running parallel with the Connecticut river and being crossed by others at right angles; it is divided into two portions by Park river, which is spanned by numerous bridges. Main Street, the principal thoroughfare, presents for about a mile an unbroken front of shops, public buildings and churches. The city proper is connected with its suburb East Hartford, by a fine iron bridge over the Connecticut river 1,000 feet long. Hartford boasts a fine public park, covering forty six acres of ground, prettily situated on the banks of Park River; at the upper end of which, are the buildings of the Episcopal College of the Holy Trinity, the leading educational institution of the city, and one of the most important in the State. The course of instruction at Trinity College is similar to that at Yale; but more attention is paid to religious studies. There are about a hundred students in residence, and a staff of about twenty able professors. Divine Service is held twice daily, at which the attendance of the undergraduates is compulsory; and attached to the College is a fine Library of 7,000 volumes, where the mitre, which belonged to Bishop Seabury, is preserved as a relic,—such ornaments not being used in the American Episcopal Church.

This city is situated on an arm of Narrangansett Bay, called Providence River, and is, after Boston, the most populous and wealthy city in New England. It is a remarkably pretty place, the prettiest in fact of all the New England towns. The river flows into the centre of the city, where it expands into a fine lagoon, nearly a mile in circumference; and round this a park has been formed, planted with beautiful elms; in addition to which there are numerous greens or squares, and a pretty park of 100 acres, called after the founder of the city Roger Williams, by a descendant of whom it was presented to the citizens. The land upon which Providence is built, is somewhat hilly; and therefore unlike the flat monotony of New Haven, it presents a diversity of appearance, rendered picturesque by the hills being covered with fine residences. The principal business thoroughfare is Westminsterstreet, and from it extends the Arcade, one of the lions of the city, of which the people of Providence are very proud. This Arcade is 225 feet long and 80 feet wide, and has three stories containing shops; it is entered at either end through an imposing Doric portico. On the heights at one end of the town, are the six buildings of the Brown University, an old, and one of the best educational institutions in New England. These buildings stand in extensive grounds, and contain a large library and art collection. The public buildings of Providence are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; several now in course of erection, when completed, will materially add to the architecture of the city. In the centre of one of the squares, stands a very fine monument of granite, with five large bronze statues, erected to the memory of those Rhode Island soldiers and sailors, who fell in the Civil War. On this monument are inscribed the seventeen hundred and odd names of those it commemorates. Providence contains a population of over 100,000, and is the most important railway centre in New England, and the seat of many manufactures; the principal being cotton and woollen goods (it being the leading American market for “prints”), the Gorham-plate, the Peabody rifles, and the celebrated Corliss engines.",164-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

It is situated between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, about six miles above their junction; at present contains about 350 miles of paved streets, and a greater number of houses than any other city in America. It is very regularly laid out, the streets all running north and south, or east and west; the former are numbered successively from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, commencing with First Street, and going up to Twenty-third, and as the city has outgrown its former limits, they are now continued on the other side of the Schuylkill and proceed for a great distance. The houses in the streets running east and west, which have mostly pomological names, as Chestnut Street, Walnut Street, Vine Street, Filbert Street, &c., are all numbered from east to west; all between First and Second Streets, being numbered from 100 to 200, and all between Second and Third Streets, from 200 to 300, and so on. This is a system that might advantageously be carried out in all new cities, as it enables a stranger to find his way about very easily. For instance, if the nearest house be 940 then the visitor knows he is between Ninth and Tenth Streets; and in like manner, as all the numbered streets running north and south are allowed a hundred numbers, for each block distant from Market Street, the centre of the city; a stranger has only to learn the cardinal points, and he can calculate to a nicety, his distance from the Delaware or Market Street. The streets however are not wide, and in spite of their regularity, Philadelphia cannot be called a fine city; especially as its public buildings are not so imposing as those of many less important places. Like Boston, it much resembles an English city, and the inhabitants generally have an old-country look. The great feature of Philadelphia is Fairmount Park, one of the largest in the world, covering a space of 2,740 acres, extending for seven miles on both sides of the Schuylkill River, and Wissahickon Creek. It is nearly fourteen miles in length, and possesses great natural beauty; though up to the present time, little has been done towards its improvement. Within the park are situated the reservoirs that supply the city with water, which latter is brought from the Schuylkill, and forced up to the reservoirs by hydraulic power. Fairmount also contains a colossal bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln, and a small Art gallery in which are a few very fine pictures. Adjoining, is the new Zoological garden, which has only recently been formed, but which already contains a good collection of animals. The grounds are well laid out, and the various houses for the animals are very elegant structures. There are some pretty squares in the city. Logan Square contains seven acres, nicely arranged; Washington Square is enclosed by a handsome iron railing, is very well kept, and contains a specimen of every kind of tree that will grow in this climate, whether indigenous or not. Franklin Square has a fine fountain in the centre, and has a very trim appearance. Rittenhouse Square is in the aristocratic portion of the city, and is surrounded by fine mansions. The principal streets are Chestnut Street, which contains the best retail establishments; Market Street, the principal business thoroughfare; and Broad Street, containing the principal private residences and churches. Other leading thoroughfares are Lombard, Arch, Race, Vine, and Third Streets.",168-171,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

The scenery on the route from Philadelphia to Baltimore is uninteresting, although numerous well-cultivated farms, and many thriving towns are passed. Amongst the latter may be enumerated Chester, the oldest town in Pennsylvania, it having been settled by some Swedes in 1643; Wilmington, the capital of the State of Delaware with a population of over 30,000, and the seat of many important industries; and Newark, a pretty little place, containing the well-known Delaware College. Shortly after leaving the latter place, the train crosses the celebrated Mason and Dixon's line, so long the boundary between the Northern and Southern States. At Havre de Grace we crossed the beautiful Susquehanna River, with its numerous pretty islands, on a bridge nearly a mile in length. This has been erected in place of the one destroyed by the Confederate soldiers in the late Civil War, for the purpose of cutting off the Federal communication with Washington. Baltimore is situated on the Patapsco River, about fourteen miles from the entrance to Chesapeake Bay; its harbour is very capacious, and consists of an inner and outer basin, protected by Fort McHenry. The city is very much like a large English provincial town in appearance, and cannot by any means be called pretty; the streets being narrow, and closely built upon; but it is one of the cleanest towns in America. The inhabitants, who pride themselves upon being the handsomest people in the States, are quiet and orderly; and the town generally has a more homely appearance than is usually the case with American cities. Altogether I would as soon live in Baltimore, as in any town in the United States. Baltimore is sometimes called the “Monumental City;” why,—it is difficult to imagine; because it only possesses three Monuments, which are however very fine. The Washington Memorial is a Doric shaft 176 feet in height, resting on a huge pedestal, and supporting a colossal statue of Washington; it forms a very imposing landmark. Battle Monument, erected to the memory of those, who fell in defending the city in 1814, when attacked by the British, is also a fine column in the form of a Roman Fasces, surmounted by a female figure representing Baltimore, the base being in the form of an Egyptian temple. There is also a fine statue erected in honor of Thomas Wildey, the founder in the States of the order of Odd Fellows. The principal edifice in the city is the new City Hall, one of the finest municipal buildings in the country. It is built entirely of white marble, in the composite style, surmounted by an immense dome; but it stands in a narrow street, where its fine proportions are not seen to advantage. The Exchange is a fine building, having on its two façades colonnades of six Ionic columns, the shafts of which are single blocks of marble of admirable workmanship. It is crowned by a large cupola, beautifully frescoed in the interior, and contains a fine reading-room. In this building are the Post Office, the Custom House and the Merchants' Bank. The Baltimore Athenæum is a fine institution, with a library of 26,000 volumes. The Peabody Institute is a fine white marble building erected by the late George Peabody the well-known philanthropist; it contains a free library of 56,000 books, and in connection with it, is an Academy of Arts.",217-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Whilst at Annapolis, I visited the Senate Chamber in the State House, memorable for being the room, in which Washington resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief of the forces, into the hands of Congress; after the objects of the Revolution had been attained. It contains a fine painting commemorating this scene; and Washington's address, and the reply of Congress, are also to be seen. The principal Naval College of the United States is at Annapolis; the buildings, situated in extensive grounds, seem to be excellently well adapted for the purpose, and the internal arrangements are said to be very good.

Washington is situated on the north bank of the Potomac River, within an area of ten square miles, reserved for the Capital, in the District of Columbia. This Federal District of Columbia contains about sixty square miles,—its chief cities being Washington, the capital of the Union, and Georgetown. The object of making a Federal district, in which to place the capital of the country, was, to prevent any one State from exercising undue influence, by having the metropolis within its jurisdiction. The old law-makers of the Republic, in its early days, seem to have regarded this point as very essential to the common weal; and jealously watched that no one State gained an ascendancy over the others, in the Councils of the country. They had also in view the dangers of centralization, and in every case, second-rate towns were made the political capitals of the different States; so that, at the present time, it is seldom the capital of the State is at the same time its chief city. It is a singular anomaly, that Washington, the centre as it were of a purely democratic republic, has neither part nor lot in the authority to which it is subject. It sends no member to Congress, being in this respect less favourably situated than the Territories, which do return delegates to speak, if not to vote. The District of Columbia, in short, has taxation without representation. The city of Washington, originally designed by A. Ellicott, during the presidency of Washington, who by the way wished it to be called “The Federal City,” was laid out on a very grand scale, as it was anticipated that it would become an immense metropolis. This has, however, not proved the case, as the city has no commercial importance: it has consequently a ridiculously straggling appearance, and in it, palaces alternate with buildings that may comparatively be termed shanties. It is built on the rectangular parallelogrammic plan so common in America. The streets are all wide, and shaded by fine trees, and are divided into numbered streets, lettered streets, and avenues: thus, First, Second, and Third streets are crossed at right angles by A, B, and C streets; whilst the avenues, named after the different States of the Union, form the main arteries of the city. The principal of these is Pennsylvania Avenue, especially that portion which extends from the White House to the Capitol, and in it are situated most of the public buildings; whilst the best retail establishments are in Seventh street. The city contains a population of about 110,000 inhabitants; but this number is much increased during the sessions of Congress, when it swarms with political agents, needy office-seekers, and general hangers-on. The great feature however, of Washington, is its public buildings, foremost among which, stands the grand Capitol, one of the largest, and of its kind perhaps the finest edifice in the world. It crowns the summit of Capitol Hill, and consists of a main or central building, 352 feet long, and 121 feet deep, and two wings each 238 feet by 140 feet, covering together 3½ acres of ground. It may be said to be three distinct Grecian temples, each having a rich Corinthian portico, the centre one being surmounted by an immense dome, which altogether dwarfs its noble proportions, and which though painted to resemble marble, is constructed of iron. The central building is constructed of light yellow freestone painted white; the two extensions are of pure white marble, and the general appearance is severely classic, although it has a great fault, inasmuch as it fronts up hill, and its principal façade is turned away from the City. It stands within some thirty acres of grounds, beautifully laid out, and adorned with statuary; and in front of the building stands Greenough's colossal statue of Washington.",221-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

On the Kentucky side of the river opposite Cincinnati, and connected with it by a magnificent iron suspension bridge 2,250 feet in length, the span between the towers being over 1,000 feet, are the cities of Covington and Newport. The view from the surrounding hills, of the three cities and the winding river, is very fine. Cincinnati is built on two terraces, rising one above the other, at a good elevation above the river; and being entirely surrounded by hills on three sides, thus lies in an amphitheatre; and this position gives it a picturesque variety of scenery, the want of which is so apparent in the majority of the large American cities. It is regularly laid out, the streets being broad, well paved, and crossing one another at right angles; although they are not as clean as they might be. This, by the way, is a failing common to all the cities of the Western States. The business portion of Cincinnati is compactly built, the buildings being for the most part of a dark freestone, which gives them a substantial appearance; the private residences are situated on the upper terrace, and on the hills in rear of the city. Fourth street is the fashionable promenade, and contains the finest shops. In Pearl street are the principal wholesale warehouses; and these being generally uniform high stone buildings, have a very imposing appearance. Third street contains the banks and insurance offices. There are, besides, many fine streets with beautiful private residences. A prominent feature in the city, is the beautiful Tyler-Davidson Fountain, erected at a cost, it is said, of £440,000, by Mr. Davidson, and by him presented to the citizens. It is of bronze, of exquisite workmanship; but it was cast in Munich, and though creditable alike in design and execution, it certainly cannot be regarded as a specimen of American art. The population of Cincinnati now approaches a quarter of a million of inhabitants, a third of which are either German or of German parentage, and occupy a portion of the city north of the Miami Canal, or the Rhine as they have re-named it. Crossing this canal, one finds oneself in seemingly quite a different country; no other language but German being heard, and the general appearance of the houses, and more especially of the numerous beer gardens, reminding one forcibly of the Fatherland. The Government buildings do not call for special mention; the County Court House being the only one with any pretensions to architectural design, but there are several very excellent charitable institutions, amongst which the Cincinnati Hospital and the Longview Asylum for the Insane are prominent. The city too is particularly well provided with firstclass educational establishments, many of them of a very high order. The principal church edifice in the city, is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Peter, a fine building in pure Grecian style with a high spire, and a portico supported upon ten columns.",236-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

The view from the steamer on starting was very fine; on the one side the city rose, terrace above terrace, towards the hill-tops, which, covered with villa residences, and vineyards, formed a beautiful semi-circular background; whilst on the other side lay the twin cities of Covington and Newport, nestling at the foot of the Kentucky Hills. The river scenery is uninteresting; towns being at great distances apart, and separated by large tracts of virgin woodland, or plains, which have a great sameness, and tend to make the trip monotonous. The land on the upper Ohio, above Cincinnati, is said to be under cultivation, and to be of a more diversified character, with pretty homely scenery. Below Cincinnati, the river, which had hitherto formed the boundary between the States of Ohio, and Kentucky, makes a sudden bend, and becomes the dividing line between the States of Indiana and Kentucky. Lawrenceburg and Aurora passed by the steamer are flourishing little towns in Indiana, and have a rather considerable shipping trade. Big-Bone Lick on the Kentucky side, is so called from a quantity of mastodon bones having here been found. Carrollton stands at the junction with the Ohio of the Kentucky river, which is navigable for about 200 miles, and possesses very picturesque scenery. Madison one of the principal cities in Indiana presents a very imposing appearance from the river; it is well built and is a place of importance, having a large commerce. Approaching Louisville the view becomes very fine; the river, here about a mile wide, is crossed by an immense bridge, which connects the Northern and Southern railway systems; whilst the view of Louisville on the one side, and of Jeffersonville on the other, is really imposing. Louisville, the chief city of Kentucky, is situated on a plain surrounded by hills, on the Ohio, near the junction with that river of the Bear-Grass creek. Opposite the city are the falls of the Ohio, which are very picturesque, being a succession of small cataracts, extending right across the river, but which disappear when the water is high. To prevent the navigation of the Ohio from being impeded when its waters are low a canal has been constructed round the falls, at great cost, to a place called Shippingport. The city covers an area of thirteen square miles, with a frontage to the river of three miles, and is laid out with great regularity; the streets being straight, wide, well-paved, and shaded by fine trees, but like those of Cincinnati they might with advantage be kept cleaner.",239-41,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Its position is unrivalled; situated on a river, that, with its tributaries commands half the traffic of the whole country; in close proximity to enormous tracts of the best agricultural land, and to almost boundless forests of fine timber; with inexhaustible resources in its coal and iron deposits; there would appear to be no limit to the future greatness of this city. Its progress hitherto has been so rapid, equalled only by that of its great rival Chicago, that it seems destined in time to become, the greatest of American cities....St. Louis is built on three terraces, rising one above the other from the water's edge, and is, in spite of its smoke, and dust, one of the finest cities in America. It extends along the river for a distance of eleven miles, and covers an area of 21 square miles; the business portion being densely built, and the whole river-front embanked, and forming a Levee, as wharves are called in America. Built for the most part of stone, the city has a very substantial appearance, and is laid out with great regularity, the streets near the river running parallel with it and further back, being at right angles to those that cross them.The streets running north and south, or parallel with the river, are numbered First, Second, Third, etc.; those extending from east to west have mostly pomological names; and the houses, being all numbered on the Philadelphia plan, it is easy to calculate one's distance from Market street, the centre of the city, or from the Levee. Front street extending the whole length of the Levee, contains fine blocks of warehouses, and together with First and Second streets, is the centre of the wholesale trade of the city.

Cairo is built on a bank of slimy mud. As the steamer approached the desolate embankment, which seemed the only barrier between the low land on which the town is built and the waters of the great river rising above it, it certainly was difficult to imagine that sane men, even though they be speculators, could have fixed upon such a spot, on which to place the site of a city—an emporium of trade and commerce. The town itself is a collection of brick houses and wooden shanties, and the streets are rendered almost impassable by mud. A more desolate-looking place cannot be conceived.

This flourishing new city stands on a yellow bluff, thirty feet above the highest floods, and is already a place of much importance. It extends for several miles along the high banks of the river, though it does not run far back. The streets are at right angles to the principal thoroughfares, which are parallel to the river. In the centre of the town is a green square planted with trees, which seems a place of great resort by the citizens. The lofty stores and warehouses, the rows of shops on the broad street along the river, and the number and size of the public and private edifices, attest the results of the development of commerce created in a great measure by the Mississippi. Memphis is the outlet of a large cotton district, and exports 400,000 bales annually. It has fine public buildings and hotels, a theatre, eighteen churches, two medical colleges, five daily and three weekly newspapers, besides numerous banks and insurance offices. It is connected by railway with New Orleans, Charleston, Louisville, and Little Rock; and possesses foundries and manufactories of boilers and machinery. Its population is estimated at something over 30,000. During the War of Secession it fell into the hands of the Federal forces after the fall of Island No. 10, in 1862, and was the base of military operations for the capture of Vicksburg. Memphis is a wonderful place, and impressed me with the idea of progress more than any other place in the States. I was perplexed and amused by the mixture of whites, negroes, and of the semi savage, degraded by his contact with the white man; by the contrast between the gigantic steamer and the “dug-out” of the black man, which are to be seen in close proximity on the river; by the roll of heavily-laden drays and the rattle of cars in the streets, and at all the phenomena of active commercial life, being included in the same scope of vision that takes in, at the other side of the Mississippi, lands scarcely yet settled, and some that remain in the same state as they were centuries ago.",253-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Seen from the river with the remains of its great earth-works, and with the Court House and the spire of the Roman Catholic Church on the highest points, Vicksburg has a somewhat imposing and even picturesque appearance. Vicksburg is the largest town, though not the capital of the State of Mississippi, and its exports of cotton before the war amounted to 100,000 bales per annum. It was strongly fortified in 1862 and provided with a numerous garrison. In January 1863 it was attacked by the Federal naval force from Memphis and New Orleans, but without success. In April 1863 a naval attack was combined with the land forces under General Grant, who defeated General Pemberton near Jackson, cut off supplies and reinforcements for the garrison, and with a close siege and continual assaults compelled a surrender on July 4th 1863, with 30,000 prisoners, 200 cannon, and 70,000 stand of arms. From the natural strength and importance of its position Vicksburg has often been called the “Quebec of the Mississippi,” but the town itself is miserable, the streets for the most part being unpaved, and the buildings irregular, and generally constructed of wood or brick. From the terrace of the Court House, the view of the river, and of the vast tracts of forest, extending as far as the eye can reach, is, however, very fine. A little above the town, situated on a hill that slopes gently down to the river, is a cemetery in which repose the bodies of more than 30,000 Federal soldiers, an awful memorial of that terrible fratricidal war, called by some Americans “a little family quarrel.” Vicksburg is a place of much commercial importance and contains about 10,000 inhabitants.",255-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

Though large, it is anything but a fine city, being built on the alluvial banks of the river, on ground lower than the high-water level, and only protected from inundations by a levee or embankment of earth, four feet high and fifteen feet wide, that extends for a great distance on both sides of the river, and forms a pleasant promenade in the winter months. The water that percolates through this embankment and the natural drainage is conducted by open gutters, which run through the streets, into a swamp that lies between the city and Lake Pontchartrain, three miles distant. There is always the danger of the Mississippi making a breach in the embankment and pouring its waters into the city; besides which, Lake Pontchartrain has a nasty habit of backing up and inundating it, after the prevalence of certain winds. Thus New Orleans is unpleasantly situated between two waters; and the soil is so full of moisture that no excavations can be made. The largest buildings have no cellars below the surface; and in the cemeteries there are no graves, the dead being placed in tombs above ground. The older part of New Orleans is built within a great bend of the river, from which circumstance it derives its name of the “Crescent City.” It has however long ago overstepped its original limits, and now extends for a distance of about twelve miles along the river bank, presenting an outline somewhat like the letter S....The streets of New Orleans are very wide and handsome in appearance, though only the principal of them are paved. Those parallel with the river extend in an unbroken line, for a distance of about twelve miles; those at right angles to them, that run from the river to the lake, are also very regular. The streets that are not paved, are simply quagmires: in winter they are not practicable at all, and even in summer the dust makes them almost impassable. The open gutters form a bad feature of the streets of New Orleans; these have very steep sides, and are crossed at street comers by small bridges, consisting of single stones, and allowing two persons only to cross at a time.",258-260,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01890/01890.pdf

The private residences have mostly beautiful gardens, which are in constant bloom, and the city itself is laid out very regularly, the streets being wide, well-shaded, and crossing one another at right angles.

These squares, twentyfour in number, vary in extent from two to three acres, and being situated equi-distant from one another, laid out in walks, and planted with evergreens and ornamental trees, assist materially in giving to the city, that appearance of tropical luxuriance of vegetation, that constitutes its great beauty.

It is now the principal city in South Carolina in size and commercial importance, and contains over 50,000 inhabitants. It is, for America, an old city, having been settled by an English colony in 1679. It played an important part in the Revolution, which obtained for the States their independence, and also in the first stages of Southern secession, the cause of the late civil war. The Harbour is an estuary about seven miles in length, extending to the Atlantic; it is almost land-locked, the entrance being only a mile in width. It is protected by strong batteries, the principal of which are Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, and Castle Pinckey; the former being situated on Sullivan's Island, at the entrance to the harbour on the right. Fort Sumter is now in ruins, and forms a picturesque feature of the harbour view; it is built on a shoal on the left side of the entrance, and commands the channel by which vessels enter. Castle Pinckey, covering the crest of a mud bank, is immediately in front of the town, being distant from it about a mile, and directly facing the entrance. It was here that open hostilities first commenced in the late war, when Fort Sumter was bombarded by the Confederates, who compelled the Federal garrison to surrender; and for a long time afterwards these fortifications were one of the chief points of Federal attack, Charleston is built on low flat land; extends a distance of three miles from north to south, and is laid out with some degree of regularity. There is no uniformity in the buildings, but the absence of regularity in this respect is more than compensated for, by the greater diversity; and as the houses are mostly detached, quaint in appearance, and surrounded by gardens containing the grand oaks, magnolias, and that luxuriant vegetation peculiar to the South; the town has a most picturesque appearance. Charleston suffered very much during the civil war, but since then, such progress has been made in the work of rebuilding, that it now shows but few traces of the great damage it sustained. King street is the principal thoroughfare and contains the best shops. In Meeting street are the warehouses in which the wholesale trade of the city is conducted, and the Banks and Insurance Offices are located in Broad street. The prettiest feature of Charleston, is a fine promenade called the Battery, situated at the water's edge, and surrounded by the best private residences.

The obstinacy however, with which it was defended, may be seen in the remains of the strong line of earthworks thrown up around it, and it was only surrendered after General Lee evacuated Petersburg in 1865. To prevent the tobacco warehouses and public stores from falling into the hands of the Federals, they, together with the bridges over the James River, were destroyed by fire. In this manner a considerable portion of the city was burned; but directly after the cessation of hostilities, the work of rebuilding commenced, and Richmond now presents but few tokens of the conflagration, and is rapidly regaining its former prosperity. The city, which is laid out with great regularity, is built on two eminences called Richmond Hill and Shocktoe Hill, separated by the Shocktoe Creek. Crowning the summit of the latter of these hills, and standing within a small park of some eight acres, is the State Capitol, a fine edifice with a portico supported on Ionic columns, the design for which is said to have been furnished by Thomas Jefferson, after that of the Maison Carrée , at Nismes, in France. Within this building is a life-size marble statue of Washington, erected by the Legislative Assembly of Virginia. Richmond contains some good public buildings, the best and most prominent being the City Hall, and the Custom House and Post Office, both of which are handsome structures.
