They have a short stumpy tail, which is kept in a perpetual jerk when they are excited. They select for their city a level sandy plain, where they can easily dig their burrows. Their towns often rival in population the largest cities in Europe. There is frequently considerable regularity in ther streets. Their houses consist of little mounds, often two or three feet high, with a hole in the center, two or three feet deep vertically. Then extending to their apartments. As soon as they see such a monster as man, each one scampers off to his own house, and squats down in his hole, peeping out and barking lustily at the intruder, till he approaches too close, when they suddenly turn a sumer sault in to their burrows. If you are still, in a short time, they will look out again to reconnoiter. What is very strange, the owl and rattle snake are their constant companions, but we surmise for no good purpose, no doubt only to devour young pups.","29, 30, 31",,,BYU Digital Collections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a peculiar stream, ever shifting among numerous Islands, and in the dry part of the sea son it is almost lost in its deep sand bed. Although it bears no vesels upon its wide and rippling surface, yet it is of vast use to the emigrants and settlers on its banks. Rushing down from its snowy mountain sources, it bears its cooling waters through sandy plains and fertile meadows furnishing water and grass for the weary emigrants winding their way along its banks towards the far sundown of Uncle Sam's dominions. Good roads this morning but no water, travelled on till 2 o'clock p.m. to reach willow springs. Some of the teams were were about fagged out. Here we found about (500) hundred wagons camped, and had to wait our turn for hours to get our stock watered. There is no grass here, but some of the boys went back on the bluffs and found plenty so we concluded to lay over. We had a hard gust of wind which blew the sand into our faces till we were nearly suffocated.","72, 73",,,BYU Digital Collections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The solid granate rocks lift themselvs perpendicularly on either side several hundred feet. From the top of the chasm the river appears like a little brook lashing the base of the passage. It is very difficult of ascent to the top of this gate owing to the numerous deep fissures among the craggy rocks Mr Dunlap and two others of our party made the difficult ascent and described the scene as grand and awful. It is said that it will make the head of the most daring real to look down the deep chasm, and that cold chills insensibly crawl over one's back at the thought of being precipitated to the bottom.","74, 75",,,BYU Digital Collections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[...] This is also a famous place for game. One men brought in an antelope, others sage hens, &c. Two of our boys said that they saw two large grizzlies, but that they ran at the sight of them. But they didn't say which ran the bears or them selves. We had some fun about it. When we first camped here none had made it a camping place, for the grass was across the river among the willows and but few had found it out, but now it is like a village so many trains have stopped to recruit [...] There is now considerable sickness among the emigrants.

The scenery is beautiful, grand, often sublime. On either side, snow-capped mountains rear their tops to the clouds, their sides being robed in evergreens of pine and cedars while at their base nestles a rich herbage of vegetation, and varigated flowers, filling the air with rich odors, and here and there beautiful springs of pure crystal water, gush forth inviting the weary ""pilgrims"" to satisfy their thirst. [...] Passing out of this cañon, the road winds through heavy forests of pine and tamaracks, going down steep after steep, among rocks and loose stones till it again reaches another cañon, through, which, dashes another mountain stream. It was dark when we arrived in this cañon, and here, in a narrow place, with scarsely a mouthful of grass, we, with many others, are compelled to camp.","86, 87, 88",,,BYU Digital Collections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One half mile down in the cañon is another village, called Mary'sville, but also belonging to Bannack. At this latter place are the quartz mills, and on the mountains are the leads of gold. Three miles further down in the narrow cañon is another collection of log huts called ""New Jerusalem"", the cabins of the miners. There are 50 or 60 houses in Yankee Flat's, about 300 in Bannack proper, and about 150 or 200 in Marysville. [...] There is but one street in town,which runs nearly N.W. and the same on Yanke Flats. There are no school houses, churches, nor public buildings of any kind, unless it be the Governor's house which is a one story log cabin like the rest. There are several stores, hotels, groceries, and numerous saloons. [...] This part of the country is inhabited by a small remnant of the once powerful Bannack tribe. They seem disposed to be friendly, and have (as I believe all other tribes) an utter dislike and dread of all other tribes There are about forty in and about town who get their living by begging and picking up the offalls of the houses and slaughter pens.
