A very few years since the wilderness, a swamp and unknown; the whole country, up to 1784, being one vast forest: it now contains over 10,000 inhabitants. A cedar swamp produces good water, and is of itself healthy; which is likewise the case where hemlock, spruce and fir abound. General Simcoe, the first governor of the province, chose Toronto, which he called, little York, in 1794, as the best scite [sic] for a capital, though he contemplated London, in the London District, from its central position between the large lakes, and its favorable situation on the river Thames. Toronto is a mass of shops, the leading feature of Canadian and American towns, 75 insomuch
 that you can hardly sneeze without bespattering a store. Its winters are six weeks shorter than those of Quebec. The original settlers of Upper Canada, (discovered by John Cabot, in 1497, whose family resided in England) were American refugees, and part of the 82nd
 regiment, disbanded on termination of the revolutionary war. Each private receiving 200 acres, without restrictions, but on discovering they would sell them for a bottle of brandy, the grant was reduced to 100, with settlement duties, and a residence of three years before enabled to sell. They located on the Long Sault, and at Niagara, formerly Newark. The first vessel which entered the Bay of Toronto, was a brig commanded by capt. Richardson, whose son is an elder in the Episcopal Methodist Society of this city. Twenty–seven steamboats ply on Lake Ontario, Bay of Quinte, and river St. Lawrence: I have counted seven at a time in Toronto Bay. Cranberry marshes in the township of Wedderburn, on account of their fever–breeding properties, are called the Infernal place: a Mr. J. Cummer, farmer and miller of Yonge Street, was the first person born in the township of Toronto: in 1834 he was thirty–five years of age. The episcopal–church is a well–built stone structure, has a choir and organ, and will contain 3000 persons. There are two catholic chapels in the city, three methodist, and four other places of public worship. The establishment of Upper Canada consists of the bishop of Quebec, two archdeacons, and circa sixty clergymen",93-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
