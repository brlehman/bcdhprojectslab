 The other City, which the reigning Family considers as its ancient Patrimony, is situated on the Hurka pira , which runs North into the Songari ula: It is commonly call’d Ninguta , tho its proper Name be Ningunta ; for these two Tartarian Words, signifying seven Chiefs , are expressive of the Rife of their Kingdom, which was first established by the seven Brothers of the present Emperor’s Great Grandfather’s Father ; who, having found means to settle them with all their Families in this Place, soon made himfelf obey’d, thro’ Fear or Love, by the rest of his Nation, which was at that Time disperfed in the Desarts that extend to the Eastern Ocean, and divided into little Hamlets, each of one Family.",245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
