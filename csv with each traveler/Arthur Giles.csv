In my “citizen” days it was the fourth, ranking after New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. It is the chief city of Louisiana, and the most southern metropolis. After Liverpool, it is the largest cotton market in the world, handling 2,000,000 bales annually, and is the third of American seaports. The population is about the same as Edinburgh, 242,039 (winter, 260,000), the percentage of nationalities being —Anglo-American, 18 per cent.; French, 17; German, 15; Irish, 14; Italian, 8; Spanish, 2.3; and 25 per cent. coloured, or 177,376 white and 14,663 coloured. Baton Rouge, a quaint old place 89 miles up the river, with a population of 10,478, is the State capital In latitude 29.56 and longitude 90.4 w., New Orleans is 106 to 108 miles from the Delta of the Mississippi, in the Gulf of Mexico, and is one of the most picturesque and interesting cities in America owing to the survival of the buildings, manners, and customs of the original French and Spanish. G. W. Cable describes it as “a city of villas and cottages, of umbrageous gardens intersected by 470 miles of unpaved streets shaded by forest trees, haunted by song-birds, fragrant with a wealth of flowers that never fails a day in the year, and abundant in season with fruit—the fig, plum, pomegranate, and orange.” The Creoles are “a handsome, graceful, and intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type.” Its history begins with the mention of the Mississippi being traversed by white men (Spaniards) in 1536, then in 1539–41–42–43; with the settlement of French in 1699, the city being founded by Bienville in 1718, and passing under Spanish domination 1764–1801. It was then Americanised by purchase, 1803; besieged in 1812 by the British, being the scene of battle in 1815, and taken in the Civil War in 1862. Its State was admitted to the Union in 1812. There are five parks, four libraries, four theatres, eighty public or private schools, fifty institutions (of which eleven are charitable), twelve insurance companies, ten railroads, twelve steamboat lines, thirty-four sea-going. Its exports are £248,000,000; imports, £50,000,000; bank capital, £2,000,000; and its valuation in 1894, £28,000,000; manufactures, £12,000,000; commerce, £88,000,000; revenue, £600,000; debt, £3,100,000 (steadily if slowly disappearing). There are twelve miles of water front. Since the '30's, when the city bade fair to reach if not outshine New York, there has not been such a spirit of emulation and enterprise as there is now. Public and private improvements are being carried out on a liberal scale. The conversion of 186 miles of streets into beautiful avenues, and transforming the car service from horse to electric, is costing £1,000,000,—(one system was the first n the States)—and all around the least changeable is all change.",125-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf

It is only now, however, at the end of 1897, that it is a part of New York included in the temporary term of Greater New York. This new district has until now been the fourth city of the United States in size and industrial interest, with 806,343 inhabitants in 1890. It is the “City of Churches,” and the “Dormitory of New York,” owing to so many city business men living there. It covers an area of 24 square miles, threaded with electric cars, and has five elevated railways within it, and three railway stations.

It has a water front on Lake Michigan of 22 miles. Its streets are wide and straight, and its buildings in the business quarter so lofty as to be famous. To name the various public halls, art, educational, literary, and other institutes, municipal and commercial buildings, and state edifices, is to enumerate every kind of structure in any city except a Cathedral, although it has a Bishop. 600 students entered its University in 1892. Its public parks, embracing 1795 acres, form a green band round the city, and afford a continuous drive of 37 miles. Lake Shore Drive, Michigan Boulevard, and Drexel Boulevard, are fine residence streets, with tasteful houses and ornamental gardens. I must not omit to mention the Pullman car works, which constitute a model little town of 11,000 inhabitants, there being five or six thousand operatives in the works. The famous stock yards had no interest for me. Instead, I paid a visit to the University, where my friend Professor Smith was, and I also left my card of introduction at the Bishop of Chicago's City rooms. The trade of Chicago is second only to New York, and in 1892 was of 308 millions sterling value, its manufactures being 117 millions. 21,123 vessels entered or cleared Chicago in 1892, being 25 per cent. above New York. The Illinois Steel Co., of which Mr. W. R. Stirling, of the Brotherhood Council, was the vice-president, employs twelve thousand men, and the M'Cormick Company produces 120,000 harvesting machines annually. The many enormously tall edifices are really steel-framed buildings veneered with stone and brick, the lower ornamental walls being often filled in last. Their height is now limited to 150 feet. The rapid running elevators make the upper stories as accessible as the ground ones. I found it quite easy to have my hair cut twenty stories up without finding it standing on end. The airiness of the position was refreshing.

Shops and places of business are also in their style more English. The ladies are less American in caste and manner, and seem just those we meet in London or Edinburgh thoroughfares. The Queen City, as Toronto is called, is the second in Canada, the population being 181,220. It extends eight miles along the lake, the buildings being substantial and sometimes handsome. The spire of St. James's Cathedral is 316 feet high, and was once the highest in America. At the Queen's Park, a wooded area of 40 acres, stands the massive buildings of the Provincial Parliament, costing £300,000, and the University of Toronto, the finest composition of college architecture in the Western Hemisphere. The main building, designed by Cumberland & Storm, costing £100,000, was burnt in 1890, but has been rebuilt, the architect of the restored building being Mr. Dick, once of Edinburgh, who hospitably entertained me as a friend of Mr. Hippolyte Blanc, R.S.A., and drove me round a good part of the city. 1300 students attend the University and College, and 300 that of Trinity College, an Anglican University.",42-3,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/17213/17213.pdf

Like Washington it has thus had the opportunity to make itself worthy of the position to which it had been raised, and is already one of the handsomest and best kept cities of the Dominion. Like its States sister, too, it is the scientific centre of the country, with the headquarters of the chief scientific societies and collections, while the presence of the Governor-General constitutes it a natural focus of cultivated and fashionable society. The first settler established himself in 1800 on the opposite side of the river—the district now called Hull, with 11,265 inhabitants. Twenty years after he transferred his claim on the subsequently called “Bytown” side—the original name of Ottawa until it became a city. The inhabitants of Ottawa numbered 44,154 in 1891, and must now have risen to 50,000. They are nearly equally divided between French and British and Protestants and Roman Catholics.

Its wide, finely laid out, asphalted streets, leafy squares and circles (some adorned with statues) and its shade tree avenues bearing names of different states, presents a system which deserves the name of city gardening. Pennsylvania Avenue, stretching a distance of a mile and a third, runs from the Capitol to the White House. The Capitol is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, 751 feet in length, and from 121 to 324 feet wide. The main edifice is sandstone, painted white, but the two wings are white marble. It occupies an area of 3½ acres. The park in which it stands is about 50 acres in extent. Its style is Classic, with Corinthian details. Opposite the central portico on the east side is a colossal statue of George Washington, and on the broad steps in front of the main doorway the inauguration of the Presidents of the United States takes place. The west side, upon which the city has extended, is approached by broad flights of steps, with a fine marble terrace. Sculpture and painting has contributed to perpetuate at the Capitol the political and historical events of the nation. The Hall of Representatives measures 139 feet by 93 feet, and is 36 feet high. There are desks for 352 members and 4 delegates. The size of the Senate Chamber is only 113 feet by 80 feet, the height being the same as the other chamber.

It has 30 miles of water front on its two rivers, and is the headquarters of two great railway systems. Its steamers ply to various ports in the world. The names of William Penn and Benjamin Franklin are bound up with its history, and it is the scene of most important official steps, such as the Assembly of the first Continental (American) Congress, in 1774; the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776; the promulgation of the Constitution in 1787; and the place of assembly for Congress up till 1797. I saw in the Market Place the huge statue of Penn, 37 feet in height, which has now been raised to the tower of the New City Hall, 510 feet high. The huge pile covers a greater area than any other American building, being 4½ acres, compared with Washington Capitol, with 3½ acres. It has a granite basement story and white marble superstructure, and has taken twenty years to build. Its style is modified French Renaissance, and the building contains 750 rooms. The Council Chamber and municipal offices are on the first floor. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania occupies the third floor. Opposite the City Hall is the most handsome Broad Street Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in the same square stands the Masonic Temple, a great granite structure in the Norman style, costing £300,000, with tower 250 feet high. The lodge rooms are in seven different styles—Egyptian, Ionic, Corinthian, Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, and Oriental. The universally known Wanamaker's Store—the Bon Marché , Whiteley's, Jenner's, or Cranston's of Philadelphia—with 4500 employees, is quite near. Through this I had the privilege of being taken, dining there. The United States Mint, in Chestnut Street (which is the Princes Street of the City), is a white marble building of immense internal interest. The officials were magnanimously courteous, and some bestowed great attention upon me as a Great Britainer by pointing out things they knew would specially interest me. I was able from a very limited numismatic knowledge to correct a misplacement of a British coin in the unique collection, a hint they received with courtly deference. The Post Office is a large granite building in the Renaissance style, and cost £1,000,000. It contains other Federal offices, and the United States Courts. Independence Hall, the old State House, is only a brick edifice, erected 1729–34, but is perhaps the most interesting building in the States. It contains the famous Liberty Bell, the first rung in the United States after the Declaration of Independence, adopted in that
 Hall. It cracked in 1835, and has been silent half a century (since 1843). Originally cast in England, it was recast in Philadelphia.

Boston Common, as the park is called, occupies 48 acres, shaded by fine elms and other trees, and, on account of its position near historic buildings and ground, it is entwined with the interests and affections of the surrounding population. There are also other parks of some importance. The city is perhaps the wealthiest in America in proportion to population. Its valuation in 1892 was £188,200,000. There are some public buildings of great interest and importance, and scientific, literary, and educational institutes, that indicate the higher culture of the residenters. Among a group of fine structures in a well-exposed area is the new Public Library, a dignified and imposing edifice, vis-à-vis to the noble Trinity Church, of which the late Bishop Phillips Brooks was rector, and where he preached the opening charge to the Brotherhood on the occasion of the Brotherhood Convention of 1892. Faneuil Hall, styled “the Cradle of American Liberty,” was the place of assembly of that Convention. Boston Public Library is known to be the largest of its kind in the world.
