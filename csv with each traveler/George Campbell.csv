Parks are very much the fashion in America; now almost every great town has a fine park. A long stream of carriages of all kinds was going towards the park, but they tailed off and became rare in the further parts. I noticed even on Sunday a large number of vehicles going out there; but I am told that these are chiefly filled by the foreign population of New York, which is very large. I should say that the park is a kind of cross between Regent's Park and the Bois de Boulogne. In the evening everything seemed very dull. There are no books in the hotels; the streets are but indifferently lighted, and nothing seemed to be going on. There was none of the liveliness of a great European city in the evening. The following day I looked about the town, and delivered some letters of introduction, being very kindly received by some very agreeable people. That evening I dined with a very pleasant and hospitable old banker, who struck me as wonderfully English in his manners and conversation as well as in his table and arrangements. I was much surprised to find that he had never been in Europe—which is a rare thing—but he had been very much in contact with Englishmen. The appearance of the city of New York did not strike me as being very different from European cities. There are some fine buildings, but I should not say that the place impresses one very much. Upon the whole it is less un-English-looking than I expected. The principal points in New York ways which struck me were the following:—The way of serving the dishes, the cookery, the food, and the arrangements altogether at the hotels. The rectangular streets, which one soon learns to find a great convenience, the number of the street giving you at once the clue to its whereabouts. Then the vehicles used, which are different from ours. The ladies' carriages are not very different; they are not particularly smart nor well set up—the fine ladies are generally content with coachmen, without footmen. But the light traps and everything that goes under the name of ‘buggy’ in America are very smart and fast vehicles indeed, with a great many fast-trotting horses. I was taken by surprise to find that the spider-like vehicles which we rather suppose to be an American eccentricity are in every-day use, not only in the towns but still more in the country and over the unmade country roads. They are made of hickory-wood, are wonderfully light, and seem to be exceedingly strong, judging by the work which they endure. They last quite as well as our heavy vehicles, and I cannot imagine why we do not follow the example in getting such-like traps.",206-208,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lake was quite smooth: there were no waves beyond ripples. We duly arrived at Chicago. The railway station was burnt down in the great fire, and has not been rebuilt. The town, though still showing a good many blanks, has been rebuilt in a wonderful way, and is undoubtedly a very fine one, but rather dirty and smoky—not clean, like the Eastern cities, where they burn anthracite coal. The whole country about is a dead level. The town is laid out on, I think, rather too great a scale; the distances are very great. Outside each quarter is a great park. I went to the Grand Pacific Hotel—not the largest, but it seems very good and well situated, and I was comfortable there. I made the acquaintance of Mr. A—, the President of the Illinois Central Railway, who gave me much assistance; and I found one or two friends whom I had before met on my travels, and who were very kind to me. I spent the day in thoroughly doing the town. I went to one of the great pig-killing establishments. It certainly was a wonderful sight. They kill and dispose of 8,000 pigs per diem. It takes three or four days to convert the pigs into bacon, but they are really made into sausages in the course of an hour. The bacon is put into railway cars in layers, without any further packing, and so sent to the Eastern States. I drove round the parks, which are not quite complete, and may be called the parks of the future; but they are very well and handsomely laid out. There is a pleasant villa suburb called Hyde Park. Most of the Western cities have a ‘Hyde Park. Here also there was an exhibition going on, which I went to see. American-made goods seemed to preponderate, the agricultural machinery, as usual, very prominent. I went to see one of the great elevators by which grain is raised by machinery, stored, and shipped. It must be understood that the elevator in America is not a mere machine for transferring the grain from one conveyance to another, but is, in fact, a great warehouse, where grain is stored sometimes for months, especially on the great lakes, where, owing to the suspension of traffic in the winter, it must often be kept for a considerable period in store. The system seems to be one under which a man does not necessarily receive back his own grain, but only a like quantity of grain of the same grade. I was not quite able to understand the nature of the interference exercised, but I found that at Chicago, and I believe at most American commercial centres, the produce brought to market is examined by official inspectors, who class the grain, and apparently nothing is allowed to be sold without being officially classed.",220-221,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The people at some of these places seemed primitive enough. After running through a considerable belt of wood we came to the Mississippi, with the city of St. Louis on the opposite side, and crossed by the great bridge, a very fine structure. I went to the Lindell Hotel, a fine and large one. My first day at St. Louis was a Sunday, and I noticed there that, although the people seemed very religious and church-going, they were somewhat Continental in their views of Sunday. Here and at other places I saw the eternal American game of base-ball being played on Sunday. There was a boat-race; and the Exhibition grounds (here, as everywhere, an agricultural exhibition was going on) were very full of people, the Sunday notwithstanding. All over America shops are closed on Sunday, as with us; but they seem to have no shutters to the windows, so that they have not the same closed appearance. I stayed at St. Louis long enough to have a good look about the town. There seemed to be many fine buildings, but I should say it is hardly so pretentious as Chicago. However, it is almost as large, with very long streets running out into the country, and a large park. I noticed in the St. Louis papers that in this State of Missouri parties are so divided that the negro vote seems to be of consequence. The question of mixed or separate schools seems to be an important one here, and the advocates of mixed schools hope to secure the votes of the blacks. I went down to have a good look at the Mississippi, that great river of America, and I was certainly disappointed. After having seen other great rivers I was not particularly struck with this one. It may be larger than the others, but the size is not palpable; the breadth is not excessive, and there is no appearance of a very strong current. According to the register it is now seven feet above low water level, which, I suppose, is rather low. The Mississippi and Missouri join a few miles above this. The water looks muddy. It is a curious thing that there seem to be no good fish in the Mississippi. There are no river-fish in the hotel bills; those that they have come over from the great lakes or from the sea. I asked about it, and they said only a few inferior fish, called cat-fish, are caught in the Mississippi.",224-225,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were many vehicles of all sorts, well horsed. Everyone seems to keep a horse; yet the price of a hack carriage is two dollars the first hour, and one dollar for every subsequent hour. The proprietors say they are obliged to take out licenses, which causes conveyances to be dear. I noticed here an ordinance against touting and soliciting custom, making it a misdemeanour. Apparently this is a municipal ordinance published by the Mayor and signed by the town clerk. The innkeepers' notice regarding liabilities for losses is a Missouri State Law (Revised Statutes of Missouri, chapter 79). Kansas City is on the Missouri River. I was very much disappointed with that river; it does not look very large. It is like an Indian river, with sandbanks in it; but I understand it does not rise so much. There are no steamers and apparently no navigation here, except a few mud-barges and small boats for local use. In fact, the river is not much used in this part of its course, but it is more used higher up, and it is navigable throughout more or less. Occasional steamers pass up, and can go up a very long way—it is scarcely known how far. The Government send steamers up by the river route for supplying their far-away outposts in the far North-West, where there are no other means of communication. Kansas City is mostly on high ground. It seems a thriving place, nothing very remarkable about it, and is quite modern in its ways. I should not have known I was so far West. My hotel was the St. James's, on high ground, comfortable and moderate. I found that no paper is published on Monday morning, and I asked, ‘Why, are people too good to print upon Sunday?’ The answer I got was, ‘No, but they drink upon Sunday.’ However, I did not see much of that, and rather think that my informant was unduly severe on his countrymen. In the afternoon I visited the stock-yards, and then went on the Kansas side of the small river which here divides the two States. There were many cattle in the yards, and most of them seemed to be very well-bred animals—not very fat, but tolerably so. I understand that they will go to the American butchers at once. The greater number come from Texas, many also from Colorado. The cattle raised in Colorado are said to be the best-bred. Much good short-horn blood has, I believe, been introduced of late years. The cattle come here by rail. There is no grazing-ground along which they could be driven for two or three hundred miles from this. They are driven from Texas up to the railway, and then trucked. These railways have certainly led to the cultivation and civilisation of the country in a marvellous degree. Where a few years ago all was uncultivated and barbarous now things are almost as civilised as in an English town, to say the least. The bad spirits who hover on the borders of civilisation have gone farther West. To see the real West one must go much farther than Kansas City; but as my inquiries lie chiefly in another direction I have not gone farther.",226-228,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My guide-book directed me to the Union Depôt Hotel, but I found it had been burnt down in last year's riots, and I went to the Seventh Avenue Hotel. The next day was Sunday, and it struck me that Pittsburgh was a singularly dull and uninteresting place on that day; nothing seemed to be going on. The people seem respectable enough; but very many men of various sorts were hanging about the streets in a moody kind of way. I can easily imagine it to be the sort of place for an outbreak like that which occurred last year. However, at present the place is as full of women and children as other places, and one sees wonderfully few signs of last year's destruction. The more I walk about the place the more smoky and grimy and dull-looking it seems to be. I observe many negroes about, many of the women in smart Sunday dresses. The relations between them and the whites appear quite good. The next day a gentleman connected with the Pennsylvania Central Railway was kind enough to drive me about the town and show me some of the sights. I now learned that there was a special reason for the extreme dullness and want of motion yesterday. It seems that a great Sunday-closing movement has just broken out, an old Act of 1794 having been put in force against the publicans, or saloon-keepers, as they are called in America; and they in turn have put in force the law against everyone else. Almost all the street-cars were stopped and every sort of traffic. The saloon-keepers have established a ‘Detective Association’ to deal with Sunday-breakers, and are now the great promoters of the closing movement, which is the great question of the day. There used to be very many saloons and much drinking in Pittsburgh; but ‘Murphy’ has been very active lately, and is said to have had a great effect. He is here now. I am afraid it seems inconsistent with what I have said in detraction of the Pittsburgh people, but I am told that this is a very Presbyterian and Scotch-Irish place. Before the war many negroes took refuge here, but it is said there are hardly so many of them now as there were then. This is a great railway centre. A very inconvenient peculiarity of American freedom is the great variety of railway gauges, which gives much trouble in regard to the through lines; but they have got over this difficulty by a system of hoisting the carriages off one set of wheels and putting them on another. This is very rapidly done; and in this way, notwithstanding change of gauge, carriages are run through for long distances. There is a very large traffic between this 243 place and Lake Erie. Ironstone is brought in large quantities from the Lake regions. We visited one of the largest ironworks.",241-243,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like all other American cities it is very rectangular, but some of the streets are more European-looking and better filled than any I had yet seen in America. Chestnut and Walnut and such-like streets run between the Delaware and the Schuylkill rivers, and at right angles to them run the numbered streets. The Delaware is not here a very large river; there is a tide, but the water is fresh, it being a long way from the sea. There is said to be not less water in the river than over the New York Bar; but the disadvantage is that the shallow places are more numerous, and it takes longer to pass all of them. Evidently the port is at some disadvantage in this respect. Some of the larger steamers do not care to come up. In regard to the grain trade Philadelphia is much pressed by Baltimore; there is great rivalry between the two places. I went to see Independence House and several other sights. Mr. B—, a countryman of mine, to whom I had an introduction, was good enough to drive me about in the afternoon. He took me through the famous Fairmount Park. A very fine large park it is. The site of the Centennial Exhibition was in this park, and certainly a very commanding and good site. Beyond the park both sides of a pretty stream have been taken up for a continuation of the drive, making it altogether eleven miles in length. The country here is not hilly, but undulating and pretty.",247-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We passed through a pleasant country, with many houses on the banks of the river. It was dark before we reached Baltimore. The general aspect of the place seemed to be, that in the lower parts land and water were very much intermixed. At Baltimore I stopped at the Mount Vernon Hotel. It is kept on the European and not on the American plan, and seemed nice, but on experience I was a good deal disappointed with it. They say that this European fashion does not suit people here, and that the hotel, which was once good, is not now well maintained. Comparing the harbour here with that of Philadelphia and other places, I am told that the United States Government undertake the charge of rivers, harbours, and works of internal navigation. They have made some bad essays in that line in Pennsylvania, and the system altogether leads to a good deal of jobbing. I am inclined to prefer our own system, under which each town and municipality undertakes its own improvements.... Here in Baltimore they have some branches of industry very much to themselves, notably caulking ships and brick-making. They have, I am told, a ship-caulking company composed entirely of coloured men, and managed by coloured men. I was sorry that in my stay here I did not manage to see something of this company, for this is the only case of which I have heard where black men have successfully managed anything of the kind. They do not own much land, I am told, but they work well on the land in the country about here, as well as in domestic service. They form about a fourth of the population here. I had a curious account of their Freemason and other societies. Freemason lodges are believed to have existed among them even in the days of slavery, unknown to their masters. The system is said to have been brought from the British colonies; and the Freemasonry among them was, I am told, made very evident during the war.",256-258,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The entrance to Washington is through a poor part of the town. The Capitol is very conspicuous; from a distance it looks like St. Peter's at Rome. When we get well into the town it improves very much indeed; very fine, wide avenues have been laid out, radiating from central points; and there are some fine streets. The place was laid out by Washington himself in his capacity of engineer and surveyor. It seems that he had great ideas of the future, and a sort of mania for broad streets and magnificent designs. The accounts I heard of him remind me of our engineer-soldier, Lord Napier of Magdala. Washington meant the principal part of the city to be on the side where it is not now, but land speculators took up the land and ran up the prices so high that people built on what he meant to be the back part of the town; that is now the City of Washington, with the Capitol, as it were, looking away from it. Some modern Americans grumble about the width of the Washington streets, and say that the vastness of the place dwarfs the buildings. I must say that I think Washington was quite right. In this climate, where trees grow easily, broad avenues are very effective and pleasing; and although the City of Washington was for upwards of half a century a complete failure, and until a few years ago was not at all successful, it has made immense strides of late years, and now, to my taste, is by far the best city in America. It is not only well laid out, handsome, and clean, but it has that which is altogether wanting in all other places in America that I have seen, viz., good pavement. All the principal avenues and streets are laid down with excellent asphalte pavement; so that instead of being the worst it is the best-paved town in the world that I know; that is, so far as the principal streets go. There are a number of very fine public buildings, many of them of superb granite and marble.",270-271,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went to the Yarborough House Hotel, which I found comfortable. Reading the local papers in the evening, I saw that most of the seats in Congress for this State are contested. I did not see evidence of any great bitterness. In the papers I noticed an account of a local county meeting for Wayne County—not a popular meeting, but only of the County Commissioners, who are five in number. The subjects seemed very like those dealt with by our Local Boards. I remarked the following:—The poor-house and paupers; the county gaol; roads and bridges, and apportionment of labour—in these States the inhabitants are bound to work on the roads on the system which used to be called ‘Statute labour’ in Scotland—; spirit licences; valuation of property; registration of voters; arrangement of school districts; appointment of a local constable on a casual vacancy. It is mentioned that there are nine paupers in the poor-house—four white and five coloured—and then there is a notice of small allowances granted to out-paupers....The town of Raleigh is, as usual, very scattered, with broad streets quite unpaved, and a good deal of ornamental ground about the houses. The population of the place is about 12,000. The Capitol is a fine building, in a commanding situation. I noticed a very large lunatic asylum, and there seemed to be a good many other institutions. There are many whiskey shops, and a good many churches. The cotton market is very busy; the general market seems well supplied.

My black friend attributes the injury to Columbia to the Confederates, but does not put it in an unreasonably wicked light. The town seems now to have very much recovered from the destruction. It has been much rebuilt, and looks very well. Many of the best houses were built by the carpet-bag officials. The Capitol seems a fine building; all the public offices are in it, as is usually the case. There are wide grassy streets lined with good trees, many of them magnolias and other southern plants. The houses have pretty grounds about them, and I notice some particularly thriving deodars. The situation of the town is pretty, upon a considerable river. The country about is very well wooded, and the woods are now beautifully coloured, the autumnal tints being at their best. I notice several varieties of fir trees. Cows graze freely about on the grassy avenues. There are several iron works here, where they make small engines and do other such work. It is remarkable how the iron trade seems to be developing throughout the States. I understand that in all these works except one, they employ exclusively white labour.

It is a remarkably nice-looking place, with good hotels and many comforts. I went to the Sea Island Hotel, and was comfortable there. The town seems very pleasant and cheerful, with no signs whatever of the tyranny of black rule. It is one of the oldest settlements in America. When it was the centre of a slave population it was used as a summer residence by the neighbouring planters, who had nice houses here. These planters are described as having been very good gentlemanfarmers; they were well educated, and were especially fond of good libraries. In the early part of the war Beaufort was occupied by Federal troops, and many negroes congregated under their protection. Several of the black regiments which were raised by the Federals were stationed here. Being so occupied, the place escaped destruction and plunder, and that is why it is so well preserved. It now seems pretty prosperous, with good stores, cotton-ginning mills, phosphate dealers, and so on; but the old race of planters is gone or dispersed. Many of the houses are occupied by their widows and daughters, in a sadly impoverished condition. A good deal of long cotton comes in, grown in a small way by negroes, but nothing like what there was before. The great majority of the population of the town, and almost all the population of the surrounding country, are black; so that the Democrats have found it impossible to wrest this one county from the Radicals, who still elect the county officers and send members to the State Assembly; but the Democrats have succeeded in conquering the Congressional district. The houses are surrounded by orange-trees and pleasant vegetation, but they are not so well painted and neat as they used to be. Many of them were sold for arrears of taxes; and a good many of the smaller ones are occupied by blacks, who have thus much better quarters than they usually have. Some land in the neighbourhood is still owned by whites, but most of it by blacks, who purchased it after the tax sales. Everything seems in order; there is no squatting without title, but some of the titles are incomplete, the instalments of purchase-money not having been made good. The blacks cannot have a better chance than they have here, and I am very anxious to know how they are getting on.",352-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am told, too, that before the rain the place was very dusty. This is a great cotton mart—the centre of a large cotton-growing country. The only complaint is, that the farmers grow cotton too exclusively, and do not rotate enough, or grow food enough for themselves, but have to buy largely from the West. Augusta is on the River Savannah, which gives an immense water-power, the fall being rapid, the stream strong, and the supply constant and unfailing. Advantage has been taken of this to establish great cottonmills, which are doing a large and prosperous business. The stock of the mills is at a premium. At a very large mill which I visited they make only coarse unbleached goods, using only very low numbers of yarn; but at another mill close by they make finer goods, the yarns used being, I was told, about No. 22. It is said that, while in other parts of the States millowners are losing, these Southern mills make large profits. Three-fourths of the goods go to New York, as the commercial emporium. The labour employed is entirely white, and is upon what they call the ‘family system,’ which is much the same as the English system, as opposed to the New England practice, where the mill-girls live in great barracks. Here they have workmen's houses near the mills, much like what one sees in England. The manager says that the people work quite as well as Northern mill-workers of whom he has had experience. There are good schools in the town, and most of the people are now fairly educated; but there is no compulsory school law, direct or indirect, and no restriction as regards the work of children. The women earn from $3 to $5 a week, fifty cents a day being the wages for common hands. They are very regular and wellbehaved. Some men work well too, but they are not so good as the women. They work eleven hours a day. By the way, I may mention that I have met some people who speak rather in a depreciatory way of the morals of the charming young ladies who do the millwork in New England factories; but I have not visited these latter, and cannot say whether this is a libel. No blacks are employed in the mills here. The manager says they are not ‘responsible.’ He has not tried them—perhaps they might do well enough under superintendence. Before the war there were, I understand, several small mills successfully worked by slaves.",362-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now a great railway centre and a prosperous place; but, as I am to remain here some days, I am disappointed to find that it is not at all a pretty or nice town; very inferior in amenities to all the other Southern towns I have seen. It is, in fact, a new brick-built town, with no trees in the streets, but abundant mud, for there is now a good deal of rain. As in all American towns, there are some nice enough villa suburbs, but there is no river or open ground near. The principal hotel, the Kimball, is crammed full, and I had difficulty in getting in. It is a fine large establishment, with a great hall in the centre, which is immensely crowded. I have here realised for the first time what American spitting is. It really requires some nerve to walk across the hall. This is about the busiest season of the year for the cotton traffic and mercantile business generally, besides that the Legislature is in session. I understand that the climate of this elevated region is very good. At present, on account of clouds and rain, it is rather warm and muggy for the season of the year.",369-70,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/02850/02850.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
