All that the power of wind could do had, it seemed, been done. An avenue of tall cocoanut palms before an unchurchlike Lutheran church was destroyed, the huge and beautiful fronds, being either rent off, or torn into ribbons, hung down in long weepers. Whole streets were blocked up with every kind of furniture, mingled with great stones, fragments of ships, timbers, and branches of trees. The top of one huge barricade was surmounted by half a piano, and a merchant's counting-house displayed a great hole, through which a ship's bowsprit had been driven—much to the discomfiture of the clerk inside—by the great tidal wave which had accompanied the cyclone. In places by the sea-shore huge fires were burning, and beside these, dead bodies were being landed, nailed up in rude chests, and carried off for burial. A local Roman Catholic clergyman, amid the general paralysis, worked gallantly under the burning sun recovering bodies in the harbour. He manned a boat with some of his black sheep , went out with crucifix and holy water, and disputed with the sharks for the possession of the corpses. The air of St. Thomas, as may be supposed, infected with the taint of dead bodies floating in the harbour, or concealed under the ruins, was anything but pleasant or healthy. In fact, St. Thomas is, under any circumstances, little better than a pest-house, and is seldom free from yellow fever.",4-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saba rises in immensely steep slopes from the water's edge, and is green and beautifully fertile. This islet belongs to the Dutch, and contains about 1,500 people, mostly belonging to the Anglican Church. The inhabitants bear a good character for industry. They are visited annually by the English Bishop of Antigua, but so great is the difficulty of landing, that his lordship has never effected it without a ducking. There is no resident clergyman, but the Dutch Governor holds 8 some sort of commission from the Anglican Bishop to read the Scriptures, conduct public prayer, and bury the dead. A queer kind of compact exists between the Bishop and the Methodist preachers of St. Eustacius, by which the former binds himself not to visit that island, if the latter keep clear of Saba—a provision rather cruel to the St. Eustacians!",7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

St. Kitts looks very pretty from the sea. A zone of rich cultivation runs round the island, sloping gradually upwards to a zone of forests, overtopped by the offsets and central peak of the volcanic Mount Misery. We reached St. Kitts a little before sunset, and, going ashore, I had time to explore the ruins of Basseterre, the capital and only town, which had lately been destroyed by fire. Here stood the one fine Anglican church of all the West Indian Islands. The shell alone is left, but this is enough to show that it had been a really noble and striking edifice, solemn, massive, well adapted to the climate, and thoroughly church-like in appearance. The architect was Mr. Christian. It is built of a dark reddish-brown stone, with a massive tower, nave, aisles, and chancel. The bells, stained glass, lectern, and, indeed, all the internal fittings, except a pavement of Minton's tiles, had fallen a prey to. the flames. Almost the only houses which escaped the conflagration were those cut off from the rest by a pretty public garden, where 9 a fountain plashing amidst bowers of sweet roses presented an unexpected, and certainly an un-English and un-Colonial, bit of civilization.

I landed on a rotten quay, half ruined by a great ocean wave coincident with the recent hurricane at St. Thomas's. A rumour of that catastrophe had already reached Dominica by a sailing-craft, and the quay was thronged by crowds of negroes and creoles, all open-eared to hear the news. I was detained nearly half-an-hour giving an account of the scene of destruction I had witnessed; and it was past midnight when I found myself ensconced in bed in a house of entertainment kept by an old black widow, who proved a kind-hearted and obliging person. The house was built of wood, and was not particularly weather-tight, as I found to my cost during a tremendous shower of tropical rain which fell shortly before daybreak, The following morning, however, was fine; and a blazing sun and blue sky set off to advantage the marvellously rich vegetation in which Roseau lies embosomed, and by which, indeed, it is partly overwhelmed. The town, or rather city, for it is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric, presents a curious picture of soft and gentle decay. The island being, in a financial point of view, well nigh ruined, trade has almost entirely deserted the capital. The houses, which are most of them mere wooden shanties , raised a little way from the ground upon stone piles, are either falling or fallen into decay, and the sites of many are overgrown with trees and brushwood. The city was originally well laid out, with straight streets crossing each other at right angles, but, with one or two exceptions, they are now covered with grass, which is kept cropped beautifully short by sheep or goats, which pasture before their owners' doors. At intervals, majestic sandbox and other trees raise their gnarled trunks from the footways. A few general stores and merchants' offices upon the quay, and in one adjacent street, seem to engross all the business of the place: all else, saving only a noisy Methodist meeting-house, is as quiet as Venice. Saving only two venerable gigs, there are no wheeled carriages in the island. A soft melancholy seems to pervade the whole place...The market at Roseau, to turn to more legitimate traffic, is but poorly supplied with fish by reason of the great paucity of boats and fishermen, but fruit is brought in in great variety and abundance. The cookery at my boarding-house was very tolerable, and perhaps better than what could be had at a house of similar pretensions in England: the principal difference being, that instead of Susan's hair, one found Quasheba's wool in the dishes. The situation of the city of Roseau is lovely in the extreme. It occupies the seaward portion of a little triangular plain, the delta of a small river. 14 At one end of the town is a pretty savannah abutting on the public cemetery, and surrounded by dilapidated shanties; at the other end is the river, which, rushing down from a beautiful mountain valley behind, finds its way to the sea between the mahogany legs of numerous negress washerwomen, and over the bodies of squads of happy little blackamoors who lie soaking in the clear sweet water, with their black noses sticking out like so many little sucking hippopotami. A mile up this river I found a most delectable bathing-place, where one can get a header into deep water from a rock, and be carried down by the swift, clear current to a bank of sand below. Half a mile behind the town the hills begin to rise, and swell upwards into lovely peaked mountains, clothed with dense forests to their very summits. Following the river up from the plain, the scenery is of exquisite beauty. The road, constructed of old by the French, but now well-nigh overgrown, keeps alongside and above the stream, which dashes below over a thousand rounded boulders torn from the hills above.",45213,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Had I come by the steamer I should not have been allowed to land at all, as all communication was cut off from St. Thomas, as an infected port. Abolished in France, the passport system still flourishes in Martinique, and before dinner I was compelled to deposit the passport I had obtained from the governor of Dominica at the bureau of the police. I found tolerably comfortable quarters at the Hôtel des Bains, but the cuisine was far from good. The spécialité was palmice , the centre of the top of a kind of cabbage-palm, an excellent dish, which in colour and flavour somewhat resembles seakale. St. Pierre is a pretty and pleasant town, thoroughly French in character. It stands on a strip of land between the sea, and lofty, and, in some places, almost precipitous, hills, and it partly ascends the lower slopes of the latter. There is a pretty little promenade shaded by tamarind-trees close to the sea, and another higher up is shaded by fine mangroves. There is no regular harbour, but the bay affords a tolerably safe anchorage. The trade is considerable. The streets are well laid out and contain fairly good shops. There is generally an air of quiet respectability and homeliness about the whole place which is very pleasing. A small theatre is occasionally open, and the young men have an excellent amateur musical society. Water is abundant, streams of it conducted from the mountains running rapidly through every street, and occasionally jetting up in fountains. At one end of the town a swift torrent finds its way to the sea. Above, in a lofty and beautiful situation, stands the College, where a large number of the boys and young men of Martinique and Guadaloupe receive their education. This institution appears to be in excellent order and flourishing condition. It contains a small museum, a pleasant garden, and a splendid swimming, bath, which the pupils appeared to enjoy amazingly....The view from the signal-station on the lofty hill above St. Pierre is rich and beautiful beyond description, and the scenery altogether justifies the title which the French have applied to Martinique of the “Queen of the Antilles.” A small steamer plies between St. Pierre, the commercial capital, and Port de France, the military capital and seat of Government, and performs the voyage in about a couple of hours. The coast all the way is very pretty, the eye sweeping over snug shingle-roofed villages, peeping out from dense groves of cocoa-nut palms, to the lofty “Pitons” or sugar-loaf mountain peaks above. The rocks in places form precipices, which exhibit their volcanic origin.",19-22,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The harbour, in fact, is unrivalled in the Antilles. It is astonishing that England should have restored Martinique to France, seeing that it lies immediately between Dominica and St. Lucia, islands of less value, which she retained. It would be invaluable in time of peace as a packetstation, and in time of war as a rendezvous for the Queen's ships. The great fort presents a very imposing aspect from the sea, but, with the present calibre of artillery, would probably not be near so formidable as an entrenched earth-work citadel upon a lofty hill about a mile inland. The streets of the town are laid out at right angles to each other, and are clean and well watered with runnels upon either side, but they have somewhat of a deserted look. At one end of the town is the Savane , which is to Port de France what the Champs Elysées are to Paris, or the Esbeykeyeh to Cairo. It is a large and beautiful public promenade, shaded by grand trees, open to the sea in two directions, and commanding a lovely view inland of the forest-clad peaks of the “Pitons.” In the centre stands a fair white marble statue of unhappy Josephine, a native of Martinique. She is represented looking across the lovely bay to her quiet birthplace amongst the green cane-fields, and holds in her hand a medallion of her base betrayer, Napoleon le Grand. Twice a week the Savane is enlivened by a military band, when a good opportunity is afforded of seeing some of the Martinican belles, who certainly sustain their reputation for uncommon beauty. Round the Savane stand the residences of the Governor and the General, together with the various public offices. Near the military harbour are some magnificent sablier or sandbox trees of surprising height and girth. Hard by is a new and splendid dry dock, large enough to contain vessels of the first-class; and vessels of the Royal Navy and Royal Mail Steam Company are sometimes compelled to avail themselves of its advantages to clean and refit. The harbour generally displays one or two French war-steamers, and some of the packets of the line which plies between St. Nazaire and Cayenne...At the end of the town opposite to the Savane a river joins the sea, and immediately beyond a magnificent fountain of water dashes down the staircased side of a precipitous hill-bank. The stream is brought by a subterraneous aqueduct from the mountains, and rushing forth in great volume from a semi-cupola, tumbles in a succession of waterfalls to the river. This fine work resembles in no small degree the fountain of S. Paolo on the Janiculum at Rome. It is called the “Canal de Gueydon,” having been constructed in 1856 by a Governor-General of that name. The view from the top is lovely, commanding the whole town, the harbour, the bay, Fort St. Louis, and the opposite mountains. Notwithstanding the presence of a small garrison and its being the seat of Government, there is little life stirring in Port de France, but it is a pleasant, civilized little place, and the whole island is apparently far better governed than any of those belonging to the English.",23-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this occasion I had only time to view the capital, Castries, which is prettily, if not very healthily, situated at the end of a bay, which, once entered, affords an excellent and safe anchorage for ships. The town is pretty; but as dull and stagnant as its own ditches. The people generally speak a French patois. The “French” or rather Roman church stands in a shady square, which boasts of a fountain and walks shaded by fine trees. The paltry edifice belonging to the Anglicans stands on a little knoll, which rises from a swamp outside the town. Venomous serpents are so numerous as to preclude the idea of evening services. To minister to the handful of semi-Presbyterianized Anglicans, one of the ablest and best-informed Churchmen in the diocese has been appointed, as to a penal settlement. This is one of the penalties of being “high” without being “dry” in a West Indian diocese! Upon the “Morne,” a mountain high above the town of Castries, is a deserted barrack and the residence of the administrator of the Government. The view from this elevated spot is exquisite in the extreme, and the prospect along the coast reminded me of many scenes in the Riviera between Nice and Genoa. Far off across the flashing strait gleam the distant mountains of Martinique. Behind, all is mountains, with deep valleys between. Peak rises behind peak, and each is fringed to the very summit by the greenest of green forests. The worst of looking at views in St. Lucia is that, in your ardour for the picturesque, you are likely enough to sit down on a snake. Fatal accidents are of continual occurrence. The snakes even enter the precincts of the town, and yet no reward is offered for their destruction.",28-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seen from the anchorage, with the “villa-built residences” of Fontabelle on the left, and the barracks and trees of the barrackyard on the right, and with a background of cane-fields sloping backwards to the highest part of the island, the view, though utterly untropical, is not otherwise than pretty. But any favourable illusion is immediately dispelled upon landing. I have been at Suez, I have been at Southport, and I have been at Bognor; but a town so detestable in all ways as Bridgetown I have never beheld. Built upon no particular plan, its dirty lanes are continually blocked with sugar-drays and other vehicles....There is not a decent street or a passable building in the town. A pretty drinking-fountain, indeed, was sent out from England, and erected in an open space, but for some reason known to the “powers that be” alone, it is always dry. In another open space, defiled by heaps of rubbish and two or three squalid hovels, stands a statue of Nelson, painted with exquisite taste of a bright pea-green colour! This space is called Trafalgar Square; and it is an article of the Barbadian creed that it rivals “the finest site in Europe.” At this point a little muddy creek runs up into the land, and in wet weather receives a driblet of fresh water from the upper country. The upper part of the creek, near the Rectory and the General's residence, forms an unwholesome little swamp, overgrown with dwarf mangroves, and emitting an indescribable stench when, at low tide, it is exposed to the rays of the tropical sun. Two hundred years ago Ligon complained of this creek, that it “vented out so loathsome a savour as cannot but breed ill blood;” and it will probably be two hundred years more before the modern Bims will bestir themselves to abate the nuisance. The chapterless cathedral and parish church of St. Michael stands in this neighbourhood. It is a big ugly pew-rented church, without any architectural features whatsoever. There is no cathedral service, but the old “parson and clerk duet” of the last century still prevails. What little singing there is, is “done” by a few quavery “ladies and gentlemen of the congregation,” stuck up in a west gallery, for flirtation and observation. The daughter churches—here called chapels—are, with one exception (St. Leonard's), even more hideous than their particularly plain mother. The creek already named is crossed by a bridge, which may possibly be finished in the course of a century or two. It is the successor of the original wooden bridge from which the city derived its name, the more picturesque name of St. Michael's being now applied only to the parish. Below the bridge, narrow quays extend as far as the sea. Here lighters are being continually filled with sugar and rum for conveyance to the ships, which are compelled to lie at anchor in the roadstead.",30-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The island, which is twenty-one miles long by fourteen in breadth at the widest point, resembles in shape a shoulder of mutton, the thin end being towards the north. It is divided into eleven parishes, most of which are again divided ecclesiastically into chapelry districts. The geological structure of the island is curious, and deserves a closer investigation than it has received. Unlike the rest of the Antilles, it presents no traces of igneous origin or volcanic formation. At least three-fourths of the island—all, i.e. except the so-called “Scotland district”—is formed of reefs of coral rock, which rise in successive terraces from the south and west towards the east and north, the former being evidently those which were the last upheaved. Upon these terraces of coral lies a deposit of brown or black soil, the remains of the forests, which, before its settlement and cultivation, everywhere covered the island. This soil is of great richness, and notwithstanding the destructive practice of burning the trash of the sugar-canes year after year, seems still of exuberant fertility. Latterly, however, guano has been used to a considerable extent, and without artificial stimulus the soil can scarcely be expected to hold out for many years longer. The expanses of ground lying upon the successive rock-terraces are of a plain or gently undulating character, and present to view wide tracts of undivided cane-fields, and yam and sweet-potato grounds, dotted here and there with the wooden shanties of the labourers, and the estate-houses and mills of the planters, with their tall chimneys, and groups of three or four cabbage-palms. But for these last the beholder might almost fancy himself in Lincolnshire: nothing can be uglier or more prosaic. There are no hedges or other divisions between the cane-fields; and, except the few around the estate-houses, scarcely a tree is to be seen. From these plains rise the grey terraces of coral rock, which bound the prospect in that direction, and which often form steep precipices, at the foot of which the waves of the ocean probably beat in the successive ages of their upheaval.",36-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least seventy miles from the coast of South America I noticed a change in the colour of the water, caused by the mud brought down by the “great river Oronoco,” of which Robinson Crusoe and poor Friday used to discourse, and by the Pomeroon, Essequibo, Demerara, and other rivers. As the water became tinged with mud, the flights of flyingfish, so pleasant to watch upon a wearisome voyage, no longer gladdened the sight. The steamer was unluckily late in arriving at the light-ship, and we had to lie to all night, rocking upon the muddy waves, some ten miles off the harbour, the numerous mud-banks rendering it unsafe to approach the harbour during the darkness. The first sight of the South American Continent is, at this point, far from impressive, being simply a long line of wood rising above muddy water. When I woke next morning, we were lying in the harbour, and as I looked through my cabin window, I could almost have fancied I was lying off dear old Lynn in Norfolk, so muddy was the harbour, and so flat the coast. The harbour of George Town is formed by the mouth of the Demerara River, and the city lies along its bank as far as a low point of land which juts out into the sea, and is defended by a rotten fort. The opposite point is lined by mangrove and other trees, which extend far into the muddy water, and form a malarious and frightful swamp. The eye ranges a long way up the wide, muddy river, whose banks are lined with swamps and jungle, of which the branches dip into the water, and above which, here and there, peers up the tall chimney of the works on some sugar plantation, highly suggestive of Marshland or the fens of Cambridgeshire. One lands at George Town upon a small wooden pier, the river and sea frontage being unfortunately cut up in a right British fashion into private wharves, no public right of way existing along the banks; a capital defect in an otherwise well-laidout town. Debouching from a narrow lane, the new comer finds himself in a broadish street of great length, lined with the stores and offices of the various merchants. This street, with one or two windings, extends as far as the fort already named, and gives access to a kind of promenade on the sea-wall beyond, growing, as it advances, gradually meaner and meaner. In the other direction it ends in a kind of swamp, abounding in rushes, and lit at night by fireflies. In the midst of this swamp stand the public buildings, one of the ugliest and meanest piles in the British Empire. Beyond this is a suburb named Charlestown....So far, however, as general cleanliness, progress, convenience, and even a kind of beauty are concerned, the change from Bridgetown to George Town is a change from barbarism to civilization. The streets are wide and well laid out, and generally run in straight lines. Excepting Water Street, which is the Strand of George Town, and which is full of stores, the streets, which are of great length, have straight canals running through the midst; these being relics of the old Dutch dominion. The canals are sometimes lined with oleanders, and are always bordered by strips of grass. Next, upon either side, come the two carriage ways, then other strips of grass, and then the houses, which stand single, and commonly have beautiful gardens around and between them. In the midst of the town is an open space, called the Parade Ground, where the Demeraran youth disport themselves at cricket, and hard by is a small but pretty botanical garden.",121-4,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distance is about sixty miles, and the voyage was monotonous enough, nothing occurring to break the line of dense forest, which extends all the way along the coast. About 4 P. M. we entered the Berbice river, and a village on the left was pointed out as the capital. A more wretched place can scarcely be conceived. Two streets of detached houses, with a few stores, run parallel to the river and to each other; a gaunt-looking court-house rises from the mud at one end, an ugly church, and two or three meeting-houses, are dotted about at intervals;—and that is all. Night and day, a heavy stillness broods over everything, and if you are lucky enough to meet an occasional foot-passenger, he looks half asleep. A mile off in a swamp, and partly surrounded by bush, is a military lunatic asylum. Whether the unhappy inmates or the voluntary citizens of New Amsterdam are the madder of the two, may well admit of question. Behind the town is a mud-wall, like a “drove” in the Isle of Ely, then a long draining-canal, containing alligators, and then sugar-estates intermixed with bush.

It is a beautifully-situated city, lying on a small plain of alluvial soil between forest-clad mountains and the Gulf, which, with the vast mountain masses of misnamed Venezuela beyond, it overlooks. Wide quays extend along the seaside, and the streets are all planned at right angles to each other. The principal street is a really grand one. It is of great width, and a wide strip of grass, shaded by cabbage-palms and other flowering and forest trees, passes down its centre. In the midst is a plashing fountain; at one end is the Roman Catholic Cathedral, at the other end the sea. Along half the length of this noble street the houses are arcaded, as in an Italian town. Gravely walking about, and almost disputing the right-of-way with the passers-by, are a number of huge, black, vulture-like crows, with bare heads and necks. These birds, in consideration of their use as scavengers, are protected from injury by legislative enactment. At a short distance from this street, which is in truth a noble Alameda of the Spanish type, is a spacious square laid out with grass, refreshed by another fountain, and shaded by fine trees. Hard by are the Government offices. On one side of the square is the Anglican Church, a large oblong building, with a wide-spanning and somewhat grand roof of dark timbers, which is popularly believed to rival that of Westminster Hall. Many of the streets have rills of water running through them. Behind the city is an extremely beautiful park, dotted with fine timber and grazed by herds of cattle, and adjoining it, but extending up some of the lower spurs of the mountains, a magnificent Botanical Garden. I have seldom seen a more beautiful place. Nature in her loveliest forms is only assisted by art. The collection of palms is very good and varied; the most exquisite, perhaps, of all being a native of Trinidad, a plant whose enormous fronds spring out of the ground to a height of perhaps thirty feet. The nutmeg-trees with their shining leaves and apricot-coloured fruit, which when ripe bursts and displays the rich brown nut covered with scarlet mace, are also very fine. This garden is the resort of numberless humming-birds, which rifle the flowers immediately above one's head as one sits on a trellice-covered seat. The view from the hill above, with the tranquil park and city simmering in the heat and slumbering at its base, the placid blue-green Gulf, and the purple Cordilleras beyond, is one to remember for a lifetime, and to carry away imprinted on the mind as a solace amidst future troubles which none can take away.",136-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two mountain masses, which are called respectively the Gros and Petit Piton , though there is a difference of but thirty feet between them, are two enormous cones of rock rising abruptly from the deep sea to the height, it is said, of more than 2,500 feet. The Gros Piton is covered with wood, and has been ascended, while the Petit Piton displays more of bare rock, and is reputed to be impracticable for the foot of man. In four hours after leaving the Pitons, we had crossed the strait, and were steaming along the leeward coast of St. Vincent, under the noble forms of the Souffriere, Grand Bonhomme, and other volcanic peaks of the great central chain of Morne Garou.

Kingstown consists mainly of two parallel streets, and a kind of esplanade, which faces the sea, and boasts of a little wooden jetty. To the right is the headland already mentioned, beautifully wooded, and crowned by the fort and barracks; to the left, Sion Hill, another green headland of almost equal height, and beyond the varied outline of the Island of Bequia, the nearest of the Grenadines. Behind, green cane-fields and provision grounds, dotted with estate-houses, labourers' dwellings, and fine trees, extend upwards to a semicircle of mountains, of which the highest is known as Mount St. Andrew's. Like all the other mountains of St. Vincent, except the Souffriere, these are clothed to the summit with dense forests. In the midst of Kingstown is a market-place, shaded by fine bread-fruit and mango trees, and overlooked by the court-house and seat of the Legislature. A little further on is the parish church, which resembles a tea-chest with a pepper-pot attached, and opposite the church an enormous Methodist meeting-house, also like a tea-chest, but without a pepper-pot. The seats in the “church” are annually put up to auction, “according to law,” in the court-house, and sold to the highest bidders! This disgraceful transaction used to take place in the church itself. About a quarter of a mile from the town are the remains of a fine botanical garden. This is now a mere wilderness of magnificent nutmeg, clove, and other choice trees, for the grant by which it was supported has been withdrawn, and the garden itself abandoned to ruin. The town contains between 5,000 and 6,000 inhabitants, amongst whom are a considerable number of immigrants from Madeira. There is no book-shop, but two newspapers are published every week. I noticed a couple of schooners in course of building under some silk-cotton trees upon the beach, and the bay is enlivened by a constant succession of droghers and other small craft, from the windward coast and the nearest of the Grenadines. The first and last distinguishing quality of the inhabitants, as compared with the Bims, which struck me, was their unbounded hospitality. During the whole of my stay in the island I was continually accepting or refusing invitations, being provided with ridinghorses, and being passed on from one hospitable house to another.

The entrance to the Bay of Calliaqua is obstructed by coral reefs, parts of which are dry at very low tides. The coral is being continually brought ashore, for the purpose of being burnt into lime, and fetches about ten shillings per boat-load. A heavy boat is anchored above the reef, and the masses of growing coral are detached and brought up by long iron instruments. The fresh coral is of a tawny yellow colour, and comes up slimy and smelling abominably.

The very moment one lands at Basseterre, the seat of Government, it is plain that one is not in an English island, for one finds oneself at once—as also at St. Pierre, in Martinique—in a beautiful promenade of shady tamarind-trees, with seats placed for the refreshment of wayfarers. The streets are all neatly paved, with rills of water at the sides; and not a beggar is to be seen, vagrancy being prohibited by law, and each person being compelled to support himself, or work for his livelihood. Basseterre is beautifully situated on the lowest seaward slope of the Souffriere, a noble volcanic mountain, which, the two Pitons of St. Lucia being alone excepted, I take to be the finest mountain in the West Indies. Its base lies in the deep sea, from which ascends a zone of exquisite cultivation; then succeeds a tract of forestland, from which the several summits of the mountain ascend; the principal cone, which contains the crater, being covered with but little herbage, and being walled at its summit by huge masses of rock. The height I should suppose to be more than 5,000 feet. Basseterre is a small city, but it is well laid out. A torrent rushes down through its midst, and to the south-west there is a magnificent ravine, crossed by a bridge of a single arch, under which a rushing river finds its way to the sea. A mile and a half in the contrary direction there is another and still more beautiful ravine, and the river which forms it roars down over huge masses of black volcanic rock, and presents the most delicious pools for bathing. The blessing and luxury of such streams can be appreciated by those only who have visited the tropics. The various Government offices are arranged so as to face a large square of grass, which is bordered by fine cabbage-palms and mango-trees, and which commands a magnificent view, both of the mountains and of the sea. Beyond are the barracks of the Marines and a dismantled fort. The Cathedral is a small and unpretending, but solemn, pleasing, and cool building. It is apsidal, and its low round arches are formed of the volcanic stone of the country. The frequent earthquakes by which the island is visited preclude the possibility of the erection of a lofty tower, but advantage is taken of higher ground immediately above the church, so that the low tower, which is surmounted by a shingled spire, appears to be of considerable elevation. This expedient, so suited to the peculiar necessities of the place, is worthy of great admiration. Hard by is a large seminary conducted by the Frères Chrètiens, and the Palace of the Bishop, with a pretty garden and trellised vines in front.",154-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abutting upon the quay there is a fine promenade lined with seats and overhung with majestic sandbox or sablier trees. The shops are numerous and good, and there is an excellent market. This last is well supplied with carrots, turnips, asparagus, and other European vegetables; and during my whole stay in Guadaloupe I feasted on a delicious mountain raspberry, in taste and colour much resembling an Alpine strawberry.The streets of Pointe-à-Pitre are clean and well laid out, and not a beggar is to be seen. All classes are distinguished by quietness, politeness, and propricty, and one meets with a refreshing civility in the shops. The French negroes are distinguished from those of Barbados by their women wearing a large quantity of jewelry, of which many objects wrought in mock-pearls resemble those of the peasantry in parts of Italy. In the country estates a considerable number of Madras coolies have been introduced. There is a very fair hotel at La Pointe, and the cuisine is excellent. Altogether, there is far more of European comfort, refinement, and civilization in the French than in the English Islands, and an educated Englishman would feel far more at home either in Martinique or Guadaloupe than in Barbados.

A nearer approach showed that idea to be erroneous, for the ships at anchor before the town all displayed the Venezuelan standard hoisted half-mast high in token of some public calamity. It turned out that General Monagas, President Elect of the Republic, had just died, and was that day being buried in Caracas, and minute guns were being fired in celebration of the event. The view from the sea of La Guayra, the port of entry to the Venezuelan capital, is of singular loveliness. Above rises the huge mass of La Silla, with its twin summits, resembling in form, as its name indicates, the double peaked Spanish saddle; the upper slopes clothed with forests, the middle dotted With rare haciendas peeping out from their plantations of coffee; the lower slopes, of great steepness, formed of red torrent-seamed earth, overgrown with sparse brushwood and vast candelabra-like cactuses, and ending abruptly on the beach. The town, which is defended by a wall and by two or three forts, extends up the side of the mountain, and up a ravine, which runs up obliquely from the sea. To the left is a new sea-wall, with a fine esplanade leading to the village of Macuto; and to the right the populous village of Mayquetia, with dense groves of huge cocoapalms, and Cape Blanco beyond. La Guayra can boast of no regular harbour: the ships lie in an exposed roadstead, and landing is extremely difficult on account of the tremendous surf which almost constantly breaks upon the shore....The streets of La Guayra are clean and well kept, and there are numerous fountains. A recently planted Alameda has already begun to supply the shade which is so much needed, for La Guayra enjoys the reputation of being one of the hottest places in the world. I found tolerable accommodation in the “Posada Neptuno,” of which the padrone is an Italian from the neighbourhood of Genoa. Hard by is an excellent club. the “Club Union Guarena,” to which strangers are liberally introduced.

Leaving La Guayra at four in the morning, I commenced the ascent in the brightest moonlight I ever saw. It was easy to read the smallest small print. The sky was exquisitely clear when day broke, and revealed the full beauties of the scenery, and the great billowy mountains, green with forest, rolling down to the blue billows of the sea. Every now and then we passed long trains of carts drawn by mules, and convoys of mules and asses laded with coffee or cocoa, and conducted by picturesque red-brown men and boys wrapped in blue and scarlet ponchos. The road passes round the corner of a mountain at the height of at least 5,ooo feet and then descends rapidly upon the other side of the range. Another ascent conducts into the magnificent valley, or rather elevated plain, of Chicao; upon which, at the base of the steep slopes of La Silla, lies the city of Caracas, at a height of 2,880 feet above the sea. Though the sun here is hot, the air is clear and fresh and the climate generally delightful. The lower slopes of La Silla, upon this side, have been cleared of their covering of forest, and, except in the gullies, are covered with rough grass, and display, here and there, the red micaceous clay of which they are externally composed. The vega , or plain, is of great length, and is partly cultivated and partly grass-grown, and strewn with the grey ruins of huge convents, overthrown by the earthquake of 1812. A sufficiency, though not an abundance, of water is conveyed into the city, and partially irrigates the plain. One end of the city is dominated by a rounded red hill, crowned by a white Calvary Church. The city itself almost exactly resembles a fine Spanish city cut off at the first story, a few only of the public buildings cropping out into an apologetic and tentative second story. The houses are covered with plaster of dazzling whiteness, and are roofed with broad red tiles, made on the spot.

After several windings amidst low scrub-covered hills, interpenetrated by little creeks of blue water, the passage widens out into a lagoon, at the upper end of which appears the city of Santiago de Cuba, now the second city, but formerly the capital of the island. A large Spanish frigate and two or three gun-boats lay off the town, and the latter were discharging troops and field-guns; but with this exception there was no stir whatsoever. The city looked like a city of the dead, scarce a person appeared on the shore, and all commerce was suspended. The reason of this was that the city was closely invested by the insurgents, who had advanced within about a mile of the gates. Although I carried a Spanish passport, for which I had paid eight shillings to the Spanish consul at Kingston, I was not allowed to go ashore; and although we remained four-and-twenty hours, the efforts of the English Vice-Consul in my behalf were not crowned with success. Seen from the anchorage, the city of Santiago, or Cuba , as it is invariably called by the natives, presents a very handsome appearance.

All trade was suspended, the shops were shut, and the streets were full of soldiers and involuntary volunteers, the latter distinguished by a red cockade.

Turning in from the sea we entered a sort of broad river between perfectly flat but rocky shores, densely covered with scrubby forest. In front appeared low escar-looking hills, which, rising above the trees in the evening haze, looked like the rounded hills which rise from the Bog of Allen. These hills turned out to be islands in a great lagoon or salt-water lake, into which the channel opens out. As we threaded the shallows of this great expanse, which is called the “Bahia de Nuevitas,” the sun set red and lurid, and then “at one stride came the dark,” out of which, ere we cast anchor, glimmered the distant lights of San Fernando. Sunrise next morning displayed the great Bahia de Nuevitas to perfection. There is nothing tropical about the scenery, and were it not for the heat and its great size, I could almost have fancied myself on one of the “Broads” of my dear native county of Norfolk. As we rowed ashore, a distance of a mile, upon the unruffled surface of the lake, the sun leaped above the horizon, and tinged the waters with every tint of gold and orange and pale blue, while its golden track was flecked here and there by the passage across it of great brown pelicans, or by the rising of some huge creature of the porpoise tribe. The town of San Fernando de Nuevitas is a wretched place. The streets are all unpaved, and full of baked yellow mud, which in wet weather must be impassable. The houses are all of one story, with lofty iron-barred windows of true Spanish appearance. The people struck me as singularly handsome and noble-looking. The permanence of the Spanish type is remarkable. The Englishman degenerates into the ignoble Bim or changes into the drawn-out Yankee, but the Spaniard of Venezuela or Cuba is as true a Spaniard in appearance as is the Spaniard of Burgos or Toledo. Nuevitas derives its importance from the fact of its being the port of the considerable inland town of Puerto Principe. We took on board a few wounded Spanish soldiers and several prisoners. Some of the latter were arrested on suspicion only, and had that morning been torn away from their families, and hurried on board without even a change of clothes. A young American lady was not even allowed by the Spanish commander to have a pair of shoes which she had ordered of a shoemaker in Puerto Principe.",175-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The harbour has a narrow entrance completely dominated by the guns of El Morro and of a fort upon the western or city side, but it rapidly widens out, and affords a splendid land-locked anchorage for ships of the largest burden. From some points of view it somewhat reminds one of the great harbour at Malta. The quays are spacious, and extend a long distance; but the amount of commerce is so great that numbers of ships have to lie out in the harbour and discharge into lighters. The city rises gently from the edge of the harbour to the ridge of a low hill, which was formerly crowned by bastioned fortifications. These, however, have either been removed, or are in course of removal, and a splendid boulevard has been formed upon their site, and outside this a new city has sprung up almost as large as the old one. The Cathedral in the lower town is a building of quaint debased architecture, but for the New World looks venerable. Inside, its size redeems it from ugliness, and its thick walls and small windows render it delightfully cool. The Coro is in the eastern limb, and does not extend westward, as is usual in Spain. The church is memorable as the resting-place of the great Columbus. He was buried near the high altar, and in the wall hard by there is a bust and epitaph, apparently reproduced from an older one. The insciption under the bust runs thus:— IO RESTOS E YMAGEN DEL GRANDE MIL SIGLOS DVRAD GVARDALOS EN LA YRNA YEN LA REMEMBRANZA DE NVESTRA NACION. The other churches, save a handsome new one in course of construction, merit no attention, but some of the best have been desecrated and turned into warehouses. The clergy are universally accused of gross ignorance, and they are held in great contempt. Religion has done little or nothing to ameliorate the condition of the slaves, whom the priesthood have allowed to grow up without instruction in even the rudiments of the Christian faith. There are but two Bishoprics in the island, which is nearly as large as all England—the Metropolitan see of Santiago de Cuba, and the Provincial see of Havana. The clergy are poor, and paid by the State. Near the harbour is a pretty square, from whose centre rises a white marble statue of Don Ferdinand the Catholic; around are parterres of sweet flowers, some beautiful feathery cabbage-palms, and rows of bearded figs. This Plaza is overlooked by the Palace of the Captain-General. A military band plays here every evening. The streets of the older part of the city are narrow, as they ought to be in a hot climate, but confusion is prevented by a regulation by which wheeled carriages are compelled to go up some streets and down others. All the streets are clean, well lighted with gas, and lined with handsome shops. The houses are all built in the old Spanish style, with lofty iron-grated windows, at which the women sit in the afternoon, and the patios, passages, and window-sills are lined with handsome azulejo tiles, which, with their bright-coloured Moresco patterns, are still imported largely from Spain. The roofs are flat, and people may be seen in the evening walking upon them and catching the sea-breeze, as in an eastern city. The houses are painted white or yellow, and are sometimes picked out with other bright colours. Altogether Havana has all the appearance of a rich and civilized southern European capital. The cafés are excellent, and wine, beer, and confectionery are sold in them, as well as coffee. At night they are crowded. The cleanliness, cheerfulness, and attention of the waiters are worthy of all praise. The “Louvre” café, near the Theatre Tacon, is equal to any of the best in Paris or Naples. The boulevard at the top of the town called the “Parque,” might be a bit of the Champs Elysées. It is beautifully laid out with parterres, statues, and seats, and is crowded in the evening when the band plays. Here the beautiful Cuban ladies come in their volantes in evening dress. The central ornament of this Parque was a statue of Queen Isabella, but early on the morning of my arrival, it was 181 removed by order of General Dulce, lest it should excite “re-actionist” sentiments. The inscription originally ran: “ La Lealtad Española a Isabella Segunda; ” but the three last words were chiselled off, so Spanish loyalty remained without an object.",178-181,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sky was leaden, a blackish fog hung over the city and river, and the whole place reeked with damp and smelt of mud. Many weeks' residence did little towards modifying this, my first unfavourable impression of “the Crescent City.” In fact, New Orleans, although a large, is very far from being a fine city. Built on a bend of the Mississippi (hence its name “the Crescent City”), at the distance of about 130 miles from the bar, New Orleans has long since overflowed the bend, and now stretches for some five miles along the banks of the river, which forms its northern boundary. The river itself is considerably higher than the town, and is only kept out by banks, here termed Levees. As it is, a considerable quantity of water percolates through the banks, and runs in filthy green open gutters through the streets, and so into the festering swamp which lies between the city and Lake Ponchartrain, three miles distant. After the prevalence of certain winds this lake has a disagreeable way of backing up and inundating the city, and in time of flood there is danger of the Mississippi forming a breach and pouring down into it. The city, therefore, is continually in danger, by being between two waters, which is perhaps a degree worse than being between two fires. It is built upon mud, and, for I don't know how many swampy leagues, there is nothing but mud—mud black and deep, mud without the admixture of even the tiniest stones or smallest fragment of gravel. Only a few of the central streets of the city are paved, the rest are simply deep quagmires, with or without a central railroad track, as the case may be. The mud in these streets is such that I constantly saw carts and waggons abandoned, although drawn by powerful horses and mules; and I and the other passengers had, one day, to turn out of a street omnibus, and entirely unload a wood-dray, which had become hopelessly embogged in front of us. The gutters have steep perpendicular sides, and are crossed at street corners by small bridges, consisting of single stones, and allowing two persons at the most to cross at a time. I had previously supposed that Tunis was the muddiest city in the universe, but Tunis can no more compete with New Orleans in the matter of mire than it can with Cairo in point of beauty. Speaking generally, New Orleans bears a strong resemblance to some of the worst parts of Liverpool near the docks. The street architecture is deplorably mean; but, to speak correctly, and excepting only the old French buildings in Jackson Square, architecture has scarcely been introduced at all. The unfinished Custom-House is a deplorable building. It is built of a sad grey granite, has some fluted columns with heavy Egyptian capitals, and all its windows are stuffed up with timber. It is intended to erect another story, but before that is put on, the basement will probably have sunk down into the mud. Inside, however, there is a handsome (unfinished) hall. The principal street is Canal Street, which runs in a straight line from the levee far out into the swamps behind, and may be said to divide the city into two pretty equal parts. This street begins mean enough, picks up a little near the Custom-House, becomes tolerably handsome near the statue of Henry Clay, drops off below Christ Church, degenerates rapidly at Rampart Street, and becomes more and more beggarly, until it runs out into a foul, malarious swamp, and ends appropriately enough at a knot of cemeteries of Christians and Jews. The cemeteries, or “rests,” are full of tasteless whited sepulchres and cypresses, amongst which the members of the different firemen's companies have common tombs. Beyond again, across a canal connecting with the lake, is the Metairie Racecourse and another. Here many fine horses are kept and trained, but the Magnolia Race-course, near Mobile, is preferred. The course is composed of hardened mud. A few days after my arrival there was a tremendous rain, when a great part of the city was inundated, many car-routes rendered impassable, and numbers of houses filled with water. I saw a baker delivering bread all down a street in a boat. The prettiest spot in New Orleans is Jackson Square, so called from a bronze equestrian statue of General Jackson, which, defended by an apple-green railing, rampages in the midst. When the Northerners took New Orleans they, with exquisite taste, cut twice upon the granite pedestal of this statue,—àpropos to nothing that was said or done by General Jackson—“ The Union must and shall be preserved. ” Overlooking this square, which is laid out as a garden with formal parterres and seats, is the French Cathedral of St. Louis and two Court-Houses, built in the old French style. These three buildings have a certain old-world picturesqueness of their own, and, considering where they are, look quite venerable. At all events, they put to shame the flimsy buildings of iron and compo, which is the present fashion. The Cathedral, which has three blue-slated spires, was occupied as head-quarters during the siege in the late war. Inside it has nothing but its size to recommend it. It is crowded on Sundays, and mariners of almost all nations may be seen amongst the worshippers.",193-196,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evening was cold but clear, and the sun, as is usual in a flat country, sank down in a blaze of crimson, gold, and purple, whose reflection painted the muddy waters of Lake Ponchartrain with the most exquisite tints of colour. Before midnight we were in a channel called the Rigolettes, and stopped for a few moments off Fort Pike. A great fire was raging in the forests behind the fort, which enabled us to see the fort, with every gun and sentrybox revealed as plain as by the light of day. These fires are caused by hunters, and at one time at least six were visible at once; some of them being a full mile in length. The effect of this in the dark still night was extremely fine.

The water was too low to admit of our taking the direct route, so we made a detour of three hours, passing far past and above the city, between reed-covered swamps, swarming with ducks and other sorts of wild-fowl, until we entered the Alabama river. Mobile, known as the “Gulf City,” is a place of some thirty thousand inhabitants, but its trade is at present in a depressed state, and the place has a wretched out-at-elbows appearance. It has one good building, the post-office, and one pretty square. This last is laid out in grass, and shaded by trees, and has in its centre a green mound, upon which stands a wooden stag of singularly life-like appearance. I was told it was the work of a self-taught German sculptor. Mobile Bay and the neighbouring shores abound with oysters. Men are perpetually employed upon the levee in opening them and putting them up in tin cases by hundreds for exportation. These oysters are of delicious flavour, and immensely large. They are quite commonly as long as a man's hand after they are taken out of the shell, and the proprietor of one establishment assured me he had them frequently as long as his foot. In the outskirts of the town there is a small settlement of Choctaw Indians. These poor people live in wigwams, or huts formed of bits of wood and the bark of trees, covered with rags and deerskins. These huts are very low, only admitting the inmates in a sitting posture, and they are open upon one side. In shape they somewhat resemble the tents of the poorest Algerine Arabs. A fire is made, and the cooking done outside. The huts are usually erected in the yard or paddock of some white man's house, and some of the families even inhabit wooden shanties.

Vicksburg, which was heroically defended for near two years during the war, and was at last taken by General Grant, is the largest town, although not the capital of the State of Mississippi. It is the Ehrenbreitstein, or Quebec, of that river. Like Baton Rouge and Natchez, it is situated upon the right bank going up, and like them also it is built upon a hill of yellow clay, which here attains a considerable elevation. Seen from below, at the end of a long reach of the river, with its great and still undestroyed earthworks, its Court-House, and the spire of the Roman Church on the highest points, Vicksburg has an imposing and even picturesque appearance. But further acquaintance shows it to be but a wretched place. The greater portion of the houses are mere negro shanties, thrown down so irregularly that they look as if they had been showered down at hap-hazard from a gigantic pepper-box. The streets are unpaved, deep in mud, and paraded by dignified hogs, and the Court-House is seen to be a wretched building of dilapidated brick, covered with dirty whitewash. But the view from the terrace of the Court-House is superb, and from this point the strength, peculiarity, and importance of the position becomes at once apparent. Immediately before the town, and extending more than a mile above it, is an extremely narrow tongue of low swampy land, behind which the Mississippi is seen running parallel with the town and with the portion of the river which washes its base. Sweeping round this low point the river thus doubles upon itself. The stream here is said to be no less than 360 feet in depth. Beyond the windings of the river the eye ranges over vast tracts of forest growing far as the eye can reach upon a perfectly flat plain. Inland, behind the ridge, the country consists of low hills of yellow clay, worn by the rains into numerous ravines. A little above the town, on the slope of the hill trending towards the river, is a cemetery, which already contains more than 25,000 bodies of Federal soldiers slain during the siege; others are continually being brought in from their temporary places of interment. An awful memorial this of what I heard a Yankee describe as “a little family quarrel.” The Confederate dead were generally buried where they fell.",229-31,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a green square, planted with trees, in the centre of the town, are a number of squirrels, which, to the credit of the inhabitants, are so tame that they will even run up a stranger's legs and take nuts out of his hand. Yet, notwithstanding this tenderness towards brutes, human life is held cheap; “differences” and “difficulties,” ending in murder, being of most frequent occurrence.

Resolving at length upon the former course, I explored what may by courtesy be termed the town. It is a mixture of wooden shanties and hideous brick houses standing on the brink of yawning gulfs, filled with filth and brickbats, and of streets all but impassable from mud, and interspersed with deep holes filled with black slime. In the main street I saw a fine pair of mules vainly endeavouring to draw a lightly. loaded cart out of a quagmire. There are no crossings to any of the streets, and consequently the inhabitants all bore the appearance of mudlarks and nightmen. At one end of the town a huge dreary-looking hotel of red brick lifts itself up out of a slough of despond, and, from its utter incongruity, adds to the hopeless dismalness of the scene. Looking up the Ohio from Cairo, Mound City is descried at a bend of the river; looking down, the junction of the two great rivers is seen, with a somewhat fine reach of yellow water below, apparently surrounded by gloomy forests.

It is at present a city of the first rank as regards importance; and when its unrivalled position is taken into consideration, it seems probable that it may hereafter become the actual capital of a vast and magnificent nation. Situated on the line of the Great Pacific Railway, which must hereafter become the chief thoroughfare of the commerce of the world, upon a river which, with its tributaries, commands the traffic of half the continent, on the borders of vast tracts of the richest land in the world for agricultural purposes, close to almost boundless forests of valuable timber, and on the very spot where unlimited mineral wealth in coal and iron may be had for the digging; there seems to be no limit to the future power and prosperity of this capital of the mighty West. It has been the custom with some to say that St. Louis is “dying of natural advantages,” and it is possible that the possession of these may have caused her citizens to acquiesce in a course of comparative inaction, while the energies of their rivals at Chicago have been put forth to the utmost and even overtaxed; but new blood has been admitted to her councils, and now rapid progress is the order of the day. The new bridge over the Mississippi will be one of the wonders of the engineering world, and will, on its completion, restore to St. Louis all, and more than all, the opportunities she has lost. This bridge, from shore to shore, will measure, in total length, 1,689 feet, and will consist of three arches of cast steel, of which the two side spans will each measure 497 feet, and the central span 515 feet. When it is remembered that the widest arch-span in England is that of Southwark Bridge, which only measures 240 feet, the vastness of the work at St. Louis will be appreciated. It will be seen, from the foregoing measurements, that the river is comparatively narrow at St. Louis; its stream is consequently swift, and in places encumbered by sand-banks. The banks of the levee are somewhat steep, and the city rises over a ridge which extends along the shore, dives into a ravine, and ascends another eminence beyond. The riverfront is of vast length, and has an imposing appearance from the other side in the State of Illinois. St. Louis is a stone-built city, and contains several fine streets. The City Hall has a really picturesque dome, from whose summit a fine panorama is obtained of the city, river, and surrounding country. The finest building, however, is a new Episcopal Church, a cruciform structure of great size and noble proportions. The interior is very lofty, the walls are profusely polychromed, and an immense fresco of the Crucifixion occupies the eastern wall.",237-239,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possessed of almost unrivalled railway and water communication, and aided by a cool and bracing climate, her sons have developed a spirit of almost unequalled industry and enterprise. If, in the long run, St. Louis is destined to take the lead in the race of commercial prosperity, Chicago can never be very far behind. The city is situated at the flat and marshy head of the vast inland sea, Lake Michigan, and is itself, in great measure, built upon piles and made-land. Despite of its commercial prosperity, Chicago struck me as being the very ugliest city I have ever seen. Situated on a dead flat, its formal streets are unrelieved by a single building of architectural merit. To judge by the filthy and disgusting condition of the streets, the foul smells, the uneven pavement, and the numerous obstructions, one would suppose that Municipal Government, generally a failure in the States, was here altogether absent. In most of the streets the pavement is of wood, and as each man has the pavement before his own door at a different level from his neighbour's, one is continually running up and down stairs. The shores of the great Lake are perfectly flat, and its vast expanse of water resembles the sea, save that there is no tide to break its awful monotony, and that no fresh sweet sea-breezes blow across to elevate the spirits. In March the navigation was not yet open, the harbour was blocked with ice, and the sandy beach, strewn with small rounded pebbles of primitive rocks, was cut off from the sullen waves by a barrier of ice and frozen snow, extending along shore far as the eye can reach. A Park has been formed outside the town, near the Lake side, but at present the trees are no bigger than bushes, and penalties are denounced against any one who ventures to walk on the grass. Beyond the Park, the shores of the Lake are lined with low sanddunes, tufted with low shrubs and marram-like grass, a feature which adds to the maritime appearance of the scene. Good water not being obtainable from wells, Chicago is supplied by an ingenious expedient. A tunnel was boldly constructed under the Lake to a platform erected more than a mile from the shore, and the fresh cold water of the Lake is pumped therefrom into pipes, and so conducted to the town. Previous to the construction of these works the inhabitants depended mainly upon rain-water, collected in enormous wooden barrels, nearly as high as the houses. Like St. Louis, Chicago contains a very large population of Germans, who have their own shops, lager-beer saloons, churches, and places of amusement. German is almost as commonly heard in the streets as English. There is also a large colony of Jews. In one of the squares the Congregationalists have a tolerable Gothic chapel, not holding with Mr. C. Spurgeon that Gothic architecture was of the devil's invention; and the Unitarians possess a very pretentious mosque. The Episcopalian Cathedral is externally plain enough, but the interior is pretty; and the services, which are freely open to all, without distinction of persons, are unusually hearty and effective. The Bishop's seat occupies a position unique in Christendom. It is neither, according to primitive and Eastern usage, in the centre of the apse behind the altar, nor, according to Western usage, on the north side of the chancel in front, but it is placed behind the altar on the north-east side, a chair being set on the south-east side, also behind, for, I suppose, the rector or senior canon of the Church.",248-50,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a very striking-looking place. The Ohio, here a noble stream with a considerable current, yellow as the Tiber, divides Cincinnati in Ohio, from Covington in Kentucky, and is spanned by a magnificent Suspension-Bridge, reputed the largest in the New World. The architect was a Prussian named Roebling. The banks on both sides are steep, and speedily rise into considerable hills dotted with wood. One of these, on the outskirts of Cincinnati, descends abruptly towards the river, and is crowned by a picturesque church. This hill, with the spire rising above the city, black with the smoke of foundries and 253 factories, reminded me of St. John's, in the Park at Sheffield, but the stream which sweeps its base is, I suppose, double as wide as the Thames at Hungerford. Just below the church is a quarry in the Silurian rock, which in this neighbourhood abounds with beautiful crinoids, trilobites, corals, and other fossils. Cincinnati, pronounced “Cincinna tah ,” is also known as Porkopolis, and was described to me by an inhabitant as “the Great Hog-centre of the Universe.” Its staple is hog's flesh. I visited one of the “converting” factories, and was courteously conducted over the premises by the proprietor. Enormous yards are provided for the pigs, and leading up from these to the summit of a huge building is a gradually ascending inclined plane. Up this, which narrows towards the top, the unconscious animals proceed, gently pressed onwards by those behind, until at length a small door is reached, from which there is no return. This fatal portal, which might well be inscribed with the “Lasciate ogni speranza” of Dante, admits but one hog at a time, and the moment he enters a knife descends and cuts his throat. The momentum which is communicated to the now lifeless body whorls it downwards to successive stages, where the various operations of disembowelling, scalding, and cutting up are performed, and the grunter, which, a minute before, entered the top story in the heyday of strength and porcine beauty, finds his rest in the cellars, a minute after, in the form of hams and sides, ready stored for exportation. The slaughter season was over when I visited this “institution,” but the premises, and especially the neighbourhood of the guillotine, were still redolent with an indescribably disgusting smell of mingled blood and fat. The process, however, is worthy of admiration on account of its efficiency, extraordinary quickness, and above all, for its humanity. Piggy. is engaged in a pleasant if up-hill walk; to gratify a laudable curiosity he enters a doorway, and then, in a moment, all is over;—without a moment's anxiety of mind or pain of body, Pig is converted into Pork. Requiescat in pace in the dura ilia of the devourers of his salted remains! Cincinnati is one of the handsomest and best-built towns in the States, though the streets, as usual, are extremely filthy. A breezy hill, covered with grass, is to be laid out as a public Park; near it, on a hill, is a tottering observatory, and an enormous firework manufactory.",252-254,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At length the great smoke-city is seen upon a tongue of land between the Monongahela and Alleghany Rivers, which, flowing down with swift and eddying currents from the spurs of the Alleghany mountains, combine at this point to form the broad stream of the lordly Ohio. Spite of, and perhaps partly because of its smoke, Pittsburg has, for the United States, an unusually picturesque appearance. It is surrounded by lofty and steep hills, the rivers are spanned by noble bridges, and the Roman Cathedral which crowns an eminence near the centre of the city, though architecturally incorrect, is of noble size, and has about it an air of old-world quaintness, which, in a land of formality and straight lines, is highly pleasing. Within, the city is mean and filthy enough. I found here a Church Guild, to use an American phrase, “in full blast.” It provides a free reading-room and classes in several branches of secular knowledge. Notwithstanding its good old Saxon name of Guild, which is so alarming to certain dignitaries at home, this Society is in the hands of the low-church party, who, as in Ohio with its fanatical bishop, have the upper hand in Pennsylvania.

Baltimore is situated near the Patapsco River, some ten miles above the Bay of Chesapeake. Seawards it is defended by Fort McHenry, whose earthworks mount guns of extraordinarily heavy metal. The city itself is built upon a large number of eminences and in the ravines which intersect them. The contour of the ground prevents that dismal uniformity which is so wearying in other American towns. At the top of the town, on a site 150 feet above high-water mark, stands the Washington monument, a column of white marble surmounted by a statue, and itself rising to a height of 167 feet. The view from the summit is fine and even beautiful, though the surrounding country is deficient in trees. Most of the houses are built of red brick, which forms an agreeable contrast with the stone churches which rise from their midst. The Roman Catholic Cathedral has a grand dome, but the interior is choked with hideous rented pews. One of the Episcopal Churches is a remarkably successful imitation of an Italian church. At the time of my first visit the aged and venerable Bishop of Maryland was holding a confirmation, before which a number of adults were publicly baptized. It was refreshing to see that the aged Bishop could kneel upright in prayer, instead of sprawling in a heap upon the altar, as is the use of so many Anglican prelates at home. The population of Baltimore amounts to some 200,000 souls, and the people are remarkable for their personal beauty and agreeable manners. If, which heaven forbid!

At one end is the hill on which is built the Capitol, and a fine view of the back and dome of that vast pile is seen from the street. The Capitol itself must be regarded as being, on the whole, a fine and imposing mass of public buildings; but its faults are many and ridiculous. To begin with, it is not built on the summit, but a little below the top of the ridge on which it stands, and its front is turned away from the city and looks uphill. The dome, which possesses some elements of grandeur, is overloaded with ornaments in questionable taste, and is, after all, a mere sham, being made of iron painted in imitation of stone. It is surmounted by a hideous object, supposed to be a piece of sculpture. But its worst fault is that it completely dwarfs the portico and central building out of which it rises. The more modern white marble wings are fine. Inside, the dome is handsome, but it is defaced by some of the most hideous daubs in creation. The chambers of the Senate and of Congress are fine rooms, but their acoustic properties do not seem to be much better than those of our own Houses of Parliament. In the former I saw the thin fussy face of Senator Sumner, who was then big with his bitter speech against England; and in the latter I saw “Beast” Butler, as he is called in the Southern newspapers, the elect of “moral Massachusetts.” The spacious galleries around the chamber of Congress are open to men and women alike, and some of the latter appeared to belong, as I was assured they did belong, to a most disreputable class of society. Within the Capitol, likewise, the Supreme Court of the United States holds its sittings. The judges—a fine looking body of men—are habited in black gowns, but the lawyers address the court in their ordinary dress. At the end of Pennsylvania Avenue farthest from the Capitol, is the Treasury, a fair building of white marble. Passing this one day, about four o'clock, I was nearly overwhelmed by an avalanche of young ladies, which burst out of the building and poured down the steps. These ladies, many of whom are excessively pretty, are employed as clerks in the Union Government Offices. The effect of this upon the young gentlemen clerks must be, one would suppose, somewhat distracting. That the effect of their employment in this manner upon themselves is good, appears to be more than doubtful. The best of them, I was assured, harden under the chaff to which they are almost necessarily exposed, and the soft and gentle manner which is so charming in a woman, is exchanged for an air of half-defiance, which is far from pleasing.

Occupying the triangular point of Manhattan Island, it looks seawards down a beautiful Sound, studded with islands, and it is encompassed on two of its three sides by the broad
channel, known as the East River, which separates it from Brooklyn and Long Island, and by the lordly Hudson, which divides it from the City and State of New Jersey. The city being thus placed has this peculiarity, that it can grow at one end only. Its situation, moreover, on the eastern coast, has had effect in making New York less characteristically American than any of the other large cities. New York is cosmopolitan in its inhabitants and in its appearance, and may be described as resembling a portion of Wapping, or the dock-end of Liverpool, mixed up with streets of a semi-Parisian character. In no other city does squalor and tawdry magnificence appear in closer combination. Yet, after all, New York is a great, and withal a fine city, and if it were only kept clean, and had a tolerable system of street locomotion, and an efficient police, it would be the pleasantest residence in the New World. As it is, one would suppose there was no local government whatsoever. The commonest conveniences of the people are utterly disregarded. Even Broadway, one of the finest thoroughfares in the world, is full of unprotected traps, cellars, and areas. The squares, even in the best part of the town, such as Union Square and Madison Square, are untidy, ill-kept, strewed with dirty bits of paper, and fitted either with small round stools or narrow rails, instead of comfortable seats with backs. But municipal incapacity culminates at the Battery. This is an open space of ground, beautifully situated, at the extreme point of the triangle on which the city is built, washed on two sides by the waves, and commanding an exquisite view of Brooklyn, Jersey City, Staten Island, and the Sound. Formerly this splendid site was laid out with grass and trees; now the grass has disappeared, most of the trees have been destroyed, and the whole place “has been degraded to the level of a colossal dustheap on one side, and mouldering reminiscences of vegetation on the other.”* Added to this, it is the undisturbed resort of the vilest scum of the rabble of New York. “Castle Garden,” upon the Battery, is now an emigrant depôt, and this institution has the object of protecting newly arrived emigrants from the violence and extortion of the ruffians who waylay them on their landing.",270-271,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a strange, though beautiful place, surrounded by dark pineforests and gleaming rivers, with the clear air everlastingly resounding with the rush and roar of falling waters. The town is at present small, but it is rapidly increasing. The new Parliament Buildings are erected on the extremity of a lofty promontory of black rock, partially draped with trees, and descending abruptly into the eddying Ottawa. With the Government Offices they form an extremely imposing and picturesque mass of buildings, and are a credit to the great country of which they form the principal ornament. They are in the transition Romanesque style, with irregular towers and pinnacles, some of which are surmounted by spires covered with shingles , so to say, of shining tin. The Houses of Assembly for the upper and lower branches of Legislature form the principal mass of building, and on either side, but disconnected with the central pile, are the Government Offices, the whole forming three sides of a vast square. The isolation of the side buildings seems to me to be a great mistake, as it deprives the group of the dignity it would otherwise have possessed. When the grounds in front are laid out, it will probably seem needful to connect the sides with the centre by stone terraces and flights of steps, or, better still, by a cloister. Immediately behind the Houses of Parliament is a circular library, somewhat on the plan of the Glastonbury Abbey Kitchen, but at present unfinished. Behind this is a steep precipice down to the river. The view from this point is beautiful. Below, the Ottawa whirls in swift eddies as it rushes down from the noble falls of the Chaudière, above which extend gleaming reaches of broad river, set in dark forests and divided by pine-clad islets. Below, and on either side the falls, are enormous stacks of yellow pine-lumber waiting to be floated down the stream, with innumerable saw-mills for cutting tip the timber, turned by the water. The two Canadas are here connected by a suspension-bridge, which joins Lower Ottawa with the village of Hull. Looking down the river, the mouth of the River Gatineau is seen upon the Lower Canada side, and beyond the river, pine-forests extend across an undulating plain to the very top of the hills which form a portion of the Laurencian Chain, and bound the view. On the eastern side of the Parliament House, there is a deep gully occupied by a canal. It is intended to span this gully with a fine bridge of stone, and to lay out the ground, upon either side, park-wise. The Houses of Legislature inside are extremely handsome. The chambers have stained-glass windows, but are light and cheerful. The House of Commons is decidedly handsomer than that at Westminster, but, as in that august chamber, the acoustic properties are bad. The great beauty, after all, of this noble pile is that, unlike the cold, staring, precisional Capitol at Washington, it is in thorough harmony with the surrounding scenery.

It is in all respects a noble and beautiful city. Its streets are wide, and many of its shops and warehouses vie in size and architecture with the finest of those at New York, while in point of cleanliness no city in the United States, save, perhaps, Baltimore and some of the New England towns, can be compared with it. A magnificent quay, with well-built stone walls, extends the whole length of the city along the banks of the St. Lawrence, unmarred by the English and American selfishness of private wharfs. From this quay a fine view is obtained of the unrivalled Victoria Bridge above, and of the beautiful St. Helen's Island below, and of the wooded banks and distant mountains on the opposite side of the river. The Roman Cathedral of Notre Dame is situated in a pretty square off St. James's Street, the principal street of the town. Its great size and twin towers, despite its contemptible architecture, make it a somewhat imposing object in a general view of the city, but its interior in point of ugliness and vile taste probably exceeds any other church in the world. It is filled with yellow, rented pews, and has two tiers of galleries on either side the nave and at the entrance end, while the floor is on a steep inclined plane the wrong way, that is, it descends from the entrance down to the high or rather low altar! The decorations are only remarkable for tawdry meanness....A walk of less than a mile behind the city brings one to the summit of the Montreal “mountain,” as the inhabitants call it, the tree-clad, rocky height, which gave to the city the name of “Montreal,” instead of the ancient Indian name of Hochelaga. The view from this hill is splendid. Below, at its base, lies the city, with its many spires and noble quays; then the broad St. Lawrence, and then a vast and gently rising plain extends far as the eye can reach, dotted with villages, the shining tin spires of whose churches gleam with indescribable brightness from amidst the gloom of encircling pine-woods. At times isolated hill-ridges of mountain form, or a solitary rounded hill arises from the plain, and far away to the left are descried the distant mountains of Vermont. Seen from this elevated spot, this part of Canada seems, indeed, to be a pleasant place and a “goodly heritage.” The great Victoria Bridge, perhaps the chef-d'æuvre of Robert Stevenson, crosses the St. Lawrence about a mile from Montreal. Exclusive of the approaches, which extend some distance into the river, it is said to be a mile and a half long. As is well known, it is tubular in construction. Railway-trains alone are permitted to pass through it, but the selfishness which prevented the formation of at least a foot-way on the top must ever be matter for regret. Wonderful as a triumph of engineering skill, its straight lines, which impede the view up-stream, nevertheless render it an ugly object from the city.",289-291,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ascent is steeper, barer, and grander than that of Ehrenbreitstein, to which it bears some slight resemblance, while the huge tidal river, bearing on its bosom stately ocean ships, is in every way nobler and more beautiful than the much-belauded Rhine.

The Provincial House of Assembly is an abject building of yellowish brick, and the University, built of blue-stone, resembles a hideous range of barracks. The Roman Cathedral is a poor edifice enough, but has a certain old-world look of Frenchified picturesqueness which is not unpleasing. Inside there is no central aisle, but it is always open and looks used. The Bishop's seat is on the south side. The Anglican Cathedral, externally, precisely resembles an engine-house. I failed, after several efforts, to get inside, the usual Anglican exclusiveness and dread of private prayer keeping the church locked.

The actors were all Englishmen , and if the English at home took one view, and the English abroad took another, they were all English still, and whatever credit attached to the successful party may be fairly claimed as a matter for congratulation by ourselves at the present day. The view from the summit of the obelisk is of singular beauty and interest. The prospect is bounded by the Atlantic, and immediately below lies the city, with its many towers and spires rising up from the red dwellings, permeated by numerous creeks and channels, and built partly upon islands. Seen from this elevation, Boston looks like a New World Venice. Inland, across the causeway, over the River Charles, lies Cambridge, with the trees of the University of Harvard. While I was on the summit of the obelisk I was joined by a ragged boy of about sixteen or seventeen years of age, who was accompanied by a tawdry-looking girl of perhaps sixteen. On descending, I found he had inscribed his name in the visitors' book as “Dash Dash, Esquire, and Lady. ” Such is “Republican simplicity!” Near the City Hall is a statue of Franklin, which is better than most of the public monuments in America. The Capitol overlooks a beautiful green or park.",301-302,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is situated in the rich valley of the beautiful Connecticut River, and the heights above the town command a wide-spread prospect of rich, peaceful, well-cultivated plains, varied by swelling hills crowned with wood, and dotted with towns, villages, and smiling homesteads. The country around Hartford is indeed a very “garden of the Lord,” and the “lines” of those who dwell therein have indeed “fallen in pleasant places.” The Library of the State House contains some curious historical documents and autographs, including correspondence between Connecticut and the Kings of England and their Ministers. Here I was shown the original charter granted by Charles II. to Connecticut, and hidden for long in the “Charter Oak,” and copies of some of the original severe and cruel laws of the old Puritans....Hartford boasts of a beautifully kept public park, in the upper part of which are the buildings of the Episcopal College of the Holy Trinity. The Library of a Literary and Philosophical Society contains the first telegram that ever was despatched. A young lady was asked to write it, and wrote the appropriate sentiment: “What hath God wrought!” During my visit the singing birds of passage made their appearance in Mr. Jewell's pleasant garden, and I had the pleasure of hearing the mellow notes of the Bobolink and the cheerful song of the American Robin, a bird somewhat bigger than a thrush. Just outside Hartford on the river bank stands the enormous revolver factory or armoury of the late Col. Colt. The present firm, at the time of my visit, were executing an order for 30,000 rifles for the Russian Government. Here I saw some of the many-barrelled Gatling Field-guns in course of construction, and a kind of portable field-battery, in which a number of barrels placed side by side could be discharged at once. Colt's Armoury is surmounted by a great azure-coloured cupola studded with gold stars. Hard-by Mrs. Colt has erected an exquisite little Episcopal Church for the use of the men employed in the works.",304-306,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dotted about this grassy plain, with no particular regularity, are a number of buildings of varying degrees of ugliness, some built of old red brick, others of new greyish stone, but all of a formal and sombre character. These buildings make up the celebrated University or College of Harvard, which vies with Yale in claiming to be the first educational institution in the United States. Harvard University was founded in the year A. D. 1638, by the Rev. John Harvard, an alumnus of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, England, who, himself a Puritan, designed the College he founded for the promulgation of Puritan doctrines. The motto chosen for the College was “ Christo et 310 Ecclesiæ. ” At the present time Harvard University is governed by a President, five Fellows, a Treasurer, some thirty elective Overseers, and a large staff of Professors. Under these there are about a thousand Undergraduate Students, divided into Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen. The majority of the Undergraduates at the present time come from Massachusetts, or, at all events, from the New England States, Western and Southern youths generally preferring Yale. Upon presenting themselves for admission candidates are compelled to pass a matriculation examination, and before this are obliged to act the farce of producing testimonials of a good moral character, and when admitted must give a bond for 400 dollars to pay all charges accruing under the laws and customs of the University. “The bond must be executed by two bondsmen, who must be satisfactory to the steward of the College, and one of them must be a citizen of Massachusetts.” Some of the students reside in the town of Cambridge in lodgings, approved by the faculty, but a large number are accommodated in the several college buildings, which are, with one exception, termed Halls, and are named respectively College House, Divinity Hall, Gray's Hall, Hollis Hall, Holworthy Hall, Stoughton Hall, and Massachusetts Hall. Of these Massachusetts Hall is the oldest, and was used as barracks in the Revolutionary war. The men's rooms resemble those of an Oxford or Cambridge College, save that it is usual for two students to chum together and occupy the same apartment. Wine and spirituous liquors of all sorts are prohibited in the lodgings and College rooms—a piece of Puritan repression which is easily and often evaded; and the rowdyism of a bar-room outside not unfrequently takes the place of the cosy “wine” of a few intimate friends in that snuggest of snuggeries the “rooms” of an Oxford man. Of University discipline there is but little. There is no Proctorial surveillance; the students may come in and go out when they please, and so long as they are present at the dull and strictly enforced chapel service, can practically sleep at Boston or wherever else they please. All undergraduates, without exception, are required to attend daily morning chapel, as they are also on Sundays, unless, at the special request of their parents or guardians, they are allowed to attend other congregations in Cambridge or elsewhere.",309-311,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scenery around is charming in the extreme. Lofty hills, only just lower than mountains, come sweeping down in graceful curves to the noble Hudson, whose deep and eddying stream is enlivened by the constant passage of huge river steamers, and flecked with the white sails of sea-going ships. Rocky and tree draped islands raise their crests every here and there from the water, and pyramidal cypresses, with their dark foliage, lift themselves up amongst the woods of deciduous trees which line the steep and craggy banks. The buildings of the Academy, which are built of stone, occupy a lofty situation, and command a noble view up the river to the city of Newburg, and to the Catskill Mountains, with their swelling outline and “sleepy hollows.” In front of the College is a fine parade-ground of beautifully-kept grass, upon a natural plateau. Upon one side of this is a line of pretty villas, tenanted by the officers and professors of the Academy, and on the other side, and in front, the ground descends steeply to the river through the woods. The slopes are everywhere permeated by winding walks; some high up, and others on the very brink of the Hudson; and these, and especially “Flirtation Walk,” are as delightful as any that the world can show. In places, mock-batteries and trenches, for the instruction of the cadets, are erected upon commanding spots, but these are not allowed in any case to interfere with the beauty and picturesqueness of the natural scenery. Trees either grow naturally; or are planted exactly where they ought to grow, the grass is, for a wonder, smooth and well-kept, seats are abundant, and the place, altogether, has about it an air of cultivated taste and civilization, which can be found nowhere else in the States. West Point is essentially a gentlemanly place. The cadets are lodged in a large stone building or barracks of a somewhat imposing appearance, and the mess-room, chapel and library, are detached buildings. The library is a fine and cheerful room, and contains a few portraits of eminent officers educated in the Academy, but the collection of books does not appear to be very large. In the chapel a number of old brass guns, taken in the
Revolutionary war, are let into the walls, and flags and other trophies are suspended
at regular intervals. I confess that I viewed these trophies without a single pang. I am
convinced that the separation of the States was for the happiness both of the old country
and of the 332 separating colonies, and, in respect of the trophies, they were, after all, only
taken by one set of Englishmen from another.",330-332,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/01403/01403.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
