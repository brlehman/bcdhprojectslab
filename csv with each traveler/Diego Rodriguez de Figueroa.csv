There I heard that the runners of the Inca had arrived at Chuquichaca which is near the land of peace, and ready to pass to the other side of the river which is subject to the Spaniards. I encouraged the Indians and told them to fear nothing as I would go with them to see what people they were and what they wanted; but they were unwilling. That night seven Indians fled from fear. They carried loads containing some presents for the Inca, bought with my own money and at my cost. Considering one thing and another, I should have wished to return, if it had not been that I was ashamed, and for other secret reasons.
 
 I concealed the loads under some straw, and went on for five leagues to the valley of Amaibamba, three leagues within the land of the Inca, where they gather much coca, and where there are always many Indians at harvest time. The place was devoid of inhabitants, because all had concealed themselves in the forests. There was no one to show me the ford over the river, but I passed, I and the horse, God seeing fit to guide the horse miraculously, the depth being more than 300 estados.",170-171,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I arrived at the bridge, which is between two great hills, on the 11th of April. I made great lights on the banks of the river to see if any of the Inca’s runners had arrived. I also made a flag of a pocket handkerchief, and put it on the top of a tree as a sign of peace, and a very large cross on the bridge, that they might understand that a Spaniard and Christian had come. Then two runners came from Yucay, which is in the land of peace. They told me that my luggage had arrived and was waiting at Amaibamba, that the Indians who had fled to the mountains had now returned, that they were not frightened now that I was at the bridge, that they would feel safe while I was there, and that the Inca had gone back with his captains.{173}
 
 On the 11th they made great fires, and there was much smoke on the other side of the river. That night two Indian runners fled to the mountains because they did not dare to sleep where I slept, which was close to the bridge. There I was, in much trouble with the mosquitos, which bit me by night and by day, but in no trouble about the Inca’s people. This being the case I determined to return to Amaibamba, and wait there for the runners. If they made any remark I could say that it was three leagues away, and that the bites of mosquitos had swollen my hands and feet, and brought on a fever.",171,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They asked me if it was I who had put up the flag which I mentioned before. I said yes and that I had hoisted it as a signal that I came on an errand of peace. They answered that it was a great piece of insolence for anyone to hoist a flag in the territory of the Inca, and if it had not been that the Inca had given orders for me to enter, they would have killed me there and then. Each{176} one then began to brandish his arms, calling the Spaniards bearded cowards and thieves. Others said, “May we not kill this little bearded one, to avenge what his brethren have done to us.” I appeased them by saying it was true than when the Spaniards came they did much harm; but that now there was justice, that the people were favoured and had their liberty. They then asked me if I was one of those who came first, or whether I had arrived recently. I answered that it was seventeen years since I came from Spain, that in all times there were some good and some bad, and that now they deserved much honour for it seemed to me that they were good men. As to what others had done, the fault did not lie with me. I then gave them some drink, and I gave some of them needles, ornaments, knives, and other things, so we made friends. I then wrote to the Inca to say that I had entered his country, but had not yet come to where he was, and that in token of friendship I sent him two glass jars and two dozen buttons of green glass that looked like emeralds.",175,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I sent him salt and knives, and in return he supplied me with maize and chicha, asking me not to pass on, because he had not sent to tell the Inca anything about my arrival, but that he would come and sleep that night, to accompany me. Considering the abominable road, and the discomfort of having to travel on foot, and seeing that though I was near the goal they would not let me reach it, I sent to say that I would not go, and that I wanted to return to Cuzco. So I ordered the Indians to take the road by which we had come, and I wrote a very angry letter to the Inca saying that I had arrived at Lucuma by his order, and that one of his captains, who was on that frontier, had refused to{177} receive me in his land. With the letter I sent a hat with two plumes of feathers.

He sent another in his place named Vilcapaniguana, with a hundred Indians to help in my journey. I was lodged in Arancalla, a village of a hundred Indians, in a very rough country near the snows, where there was a large fort.
 
 I arrived there on the 9th of May, and they made me two houses on a hill two arquebus shots from the village. Presently the inhabitants of the village came with provisions for my party. Above all things they asked me to show them the contents of my loads, because they desired much to know. At first I refused, but as it seemed to me that they would manage to find out, against my will, I thought that it would be well to let them see. So they looked at everything. They saw that I carried a sword and dagger, and said that I should show them to the Inca as he would rejoice to see them. The same day a servant of the Inca arrived, with two baskets of earth nuts[83], to visit me on his part. I received him well and gave him a head cloth and an ornament; and for the Inca two packs of cards and two pair of scissors. I understood that he came to see what manner of man I was, and to learn from those who came with me what I had asked, said, and done.

The Indians told me that those Spaniards had killed him to raise the land, and that they determined to kill him while playing at la herradura. One Mendez[84] did it with four or five stabs behind until he killed him; and to Titu Cusi, the Inca who is now, they would have done the same, but he escaped down some rocks, which they showed me. They, however, succeeded in giving him a stab in the leg, the mark of which he afterwards showed me. If they had wanted to kill some Indians they could have done so, but their object was to kill the Inca. Then many Indians and captains assembled, who seized the Spaniards and killed them.
 
 On the 13th of May I sent two of my Indians to the Inca with some refreshments of raisins, figs, and other things. The Inca received them well, and gave them two baskets of earth nuts which they were to take to me, with a message that next day he would arrive, so that we should see each other soon, and that I need not travel further.
 
 On the 14th of May the Indians of Bambacona had made a large house on a strong height surrounded by entrenchments. Below were the houses of the inhabitants. The road by which he was to come was very clean and passed over a great plain. The three hundred Indians{179} with their lances, and others from the surrounding country, had made a great theatre for the Inca, of red clay. They were awaiting his arrival, and wished me to go out to meet him. They told me that the people of the village would wait on the plain, and that they would show me a place where they had brought two loads of straw, half a stone’s throw from the rest of the people. They told me to wait there, and see the entry of the Inca, and not to move until the Inca sent for me.",178,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A garrison of 200 Indians was left in Arancalla and the rest went with us. We arrived on Saturday, the eve of the Trinity, at the bridge of Chuquichaca, where we received the news that the Judge Matienzo was at the bridge of Amaibamba with 30 Spaniards, 10 negroes, 20 arquebusiers and 150 Cañari Indians with their lances. Presently we received a letter from the Judge Matienzo in which he said that he had come with this escort, that the Inca should cross the river to see him, and that the Treasurer Merlo, a clergyman, two other Spaniards and I would be hostages for his safety. The Inca wished to comply, but the captains would not consent. The Inca then wrote to the Judge Matienzo proposing that he should come with all his company to the passage of the bridge, that his honour should pass over, and that he, the Inca, would send as hostages his governor and camp master, who would go to the other side. The Inca then detached 300 Indians to keep watch and ward. I said that the Judge Matienzo would not consent to this, not having a royal commission, but that he would cross with all his escort and that, in that open space which was large, the Inca and Judge could see each other and discuss what they desired. The Inca wrote a letter to that effect. Then there were prepared litters of silver and gold and much carving, and he had 25 alcabuçes brought out, which he distributed among those who knew. He said to me that, as I was his friend, he wanted to tell me a secret. He had had 300 cloaks and also breeches of dead people brought. Then he called an assembly, saying that those who brought those clothes{197} had been killed, and if the Spaniards intended to attack, each one would become a good soldier in defence of his lord.",196,,,Project Gutenberg,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
