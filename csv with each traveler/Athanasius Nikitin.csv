 Between these large towns there are many small ones: three for each day, and occasionally four ; so many kors, so many towns. ...
 
 In Beder there is a trade in horses, goods, stuffs, silks, and all sorts of other merchandise, and also in black people ; but no other article is sold but Indian goods, and every kind of eatables ; no goods, however, that will do for Russia. And all are black and wicked, and the women all harlots, or witches, or thieves and cheats; and they destroy their masters with poison.
 
 The rulers and the nobles in the land of India are all Khorassanians. The Hindoos walk all on foot and walk fast. They are all naked and bare-footed, and carry a shield in one hand and a sword in the other. Some of the servants are armed with straight bows and arrows. Elephants are greatly used in battle. The men on foot are sent first, the Khorassanians being mounted in full armour, man as well as horse. Large scythes' are attached to the trunks. and tusks of the elephants, and the animals are clad in ornamental plates of steel. They carry a citadel, and in the citadel twelve men in armour with guns and arrows. ...
 
 Beder is the chief town of the whole of Mahomedan Hindostan ; the city is large, and contains a great many people.
 
 The sultan (of Beder) is a little man, twenty years old, in the power of the nobles. Khorassanians rule the country and serve in war. There is a Khorassanian Boyar, Melik-Tuchar, who keeps an army of 200,000 men ; Melik Khan keeps 100,000 ; Kharat Khan, 20,000, and many are the khans that keep 10,000 armed men. ...
 
 The land is overstocked with people ; but those in the country are very miserable, whilst the nobles are extremely opulent and delight in luxury. They are wont to be carried on their silver beds, preceded by some twenty chargers caparisoned in gold, and followed by 300 men on horseback and 500 on foot, and by horn-men, ten torchbearers and ten musicians.

 Throughout the night the town of Beder is guarded by Beder and 1000 men kutocalories, mounted on horses in full armour, carrying each a light.
 
 I sold my stallion at Beder, and got by him 60 and 8 footoons, having kept him a whole year. Snakes crawl about in the streets of Beder, in length two sajen (fourteen feet).","11, 12, 13, 14, 15",,,HathiTrust,https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100159067
