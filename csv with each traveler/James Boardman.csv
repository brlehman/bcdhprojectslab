It is bounded on the west by the Hudson or north river, which is here above a mile in width, and on the east by the river of that name, which separates it from the populous town of Brooklyn, on Long Island. The point opposite the bay at the junction of the rivers, and called the Battery, from its being the site of the old Dutch fortifications, is laid out with taste as a park. or mall; the verdant foliage of which affords a most agreeable shelter from the scorching rays of the sun, and renders it a delightful and favourite promenade. The main street, called Broadway, is two miles and a half long, in a straight line, and proportionably wide, with broad flagged trottoirs or side-walks, some parts of which are shaded by poplars and other lofty trees; but in the quarter devoted to business, canvass blinds are stretched from the shops to permanent wooden rails of a convenient height and neatly finished. The architecture of the buildings, however, does not at all correspond with the magnificent scale of the street, the greatest irregularity prevailing; handsome edifices of brick, and even marble, of four and five stories, being side by side with those of two or three, and in some parts actually intermixed with miserable wooden cottages. Four of the largest episcopal churches, as well as the principal hotels and boarding houses, are situated in this great thoroughfare; and it is also the Regent Street for shops, or stores, as all depositaries of merchandise, whether large or small, are called. They are mostly of mean exterior, although furnished with every variety of goods from all parts of the world.",21-2,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a comparatively insignificant place, it has become a populous city, its trade having rapidly increased since the introduction of steam navigation, and the opening of the great western and northern canals, for both which it is the entrepôt. The capitol, or state house, is a handsome building, and is finely situated, being on an eminence, and at the extremity of a long and wide street. The interior is conveniently arranged for the meetings of the legislature, as well as for the superior courts of justice. It likewise contains the state library.

It was only founded twenty years ago, previous to which the country was a perfect wilderness. In 1815, the population but consisted of about three hundred persons; whilst in the year 1829, at the period of our visit, it had risen to thirteen thousand, and was rapidly progressing. The local advantages of Rochester are very conspicuous. Seated upon the fine river Genesee, which flows through a fertile country, and is navigable for barges nearly one hundred miles above, and for sloops from Lake Ontario, seven miles below, to within two of the town, intersected by the great western canal; possessing in abundance what the Americans denominate “hydraulic privileges,” but what in plain English would be termed inexhaustible water power: it is destined to become a place of great importance. The flour, or, as they are called, flouring, mills, are numerous, and several of them are erected upon a most extensive scale; one of these immense structures containing more than four acres of flooring. They were all in full operation, and are a source of much wealth to the place. I was informed that more than twelve thousand bushels of wheat were daily ground in these mills. The produce is chiefly sent to New York; but should the Montreal or Quebec markets offer inducements, the facilities of transport to those places are now very great, the water communication being perfected by the completion of the Rideau canal in Canada. The streets and public buildings are upon a handsome scale; and besides a number of large churches, banks, hotels, and other erections of an ornamental nature, Rochester has its athenæum, museum, and other scientific institutions. The most singular feature of this bustling infant town is the condition of the environs, which are still very much in a state of nature. The transition from a crowded street to the ruins of the forest, or to the forest itself, is so sudden, that a stranger, by turning a wrong corner in the dark, might either be in danger of breaking his neck over the enormous stumps of trees, which, as yet, there has been no time to Clear away; or, escaping that calamity, might soon be entangled in the labyrinth of wood which environs this unparalleled place.",129-31,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has since been rebuilt, and is rapidly extending. Its situation, as the point of junction between the great western canal and Lake Erie, gives it immense advantages; and the day is not far distant, when Buffalo will become one of the most important places in the state. A commodious harbour has lately been constructed; and besides a number of schooners and trading sloops, steamers of large burden sail regularly during the season between this place and the various ports on the coasts of Lake Erie; among others to that of Cleaveland, the entrance of the Ohio canal lately finished, which, after passing for the distance of three hundred miles through the fertile and now populous state of that name, communicates with the great river Ohio, one of the grand tributaries to the Mississippi. These vessels also visit Detroit, a populous district, and occasionally make trips to the new settlements, as far as Lake Michigan, a distance of nearly one thousand miles. The neighbourhood of Detroit, which was founded by the French, nearly two centuries ago, was represented to me as being a most desirable location. The squares and streets of Buffalo are planned upon an extensive scale, and the buildings are pretty good. The Eagle Hotel, that at which we took up our quarters, is not only very large, but is equal in most respects to the best in Great Britain.",154-5,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former river is rather more than a mile in width, opposite to the city; and the latter, something less than that of the Thames at London Bridge. The streets, excepting the two centre ones in each direction, are rather narrow, but perfectly straight, and cross each other at right angles at equal distances. Those from river to river are about two miles in length, and are named after different descriptions of trees, as Chestnut, Walnut, Spruce, Pine; while those in the contrary direction, the length of which is gradually prolonged with the increase of buildings, are numbered. The houses are of brick, and regular in their architecture. The steps, and the parts about the doors and windows, which, in England, are usually of stone, are of white marble; which, with the white painted doors, silvered plates and knobs, have a very chaste effect. The side walks are paved with brick, and are kept remarkably clean; and the shops are superior, as regards their external appearance, to those of New York; more of them also are devoted to the sale of engravings, and other branches of the fine arts, than in that city. Among the number of public edifices which adorn Philadelphia, the most interesting, although not the most beautiful, is the State House; for in one of its halls was signed the document which separated thirteen of the American colonies from Great Britain.",186-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plan of the embryo capital is at once grand and unique. Very long and broad avenues diverge from centres, and are intersected by streets at right angles. Only one of the former, however, and not many of the latter, contain any buildings; and these are, for the most part, as paltry as they are scattered, although the city contains a population of twenty thousand persons. The chief architectural ornament of Washington, and, indeed, of the Union, is the edifice called the Capitol, in which are the Chambers of Congress, the Supreme Courts, and the National Library. This noble building, which stands on a most commanding site, is 350 feet in length, and is surmounted by a lofty but heavy dome. The style of architecture is Palladian, and the material freestone; but, in consequence of the discolouration produced by the burning of the interior by the British, the whole of the outside has been painted white, —a very questionable proceeding as regards effect, to say nothing of the periodical expense which will be thereby incurred. The principal entrance, which is under a magnificent portico, opens into a circular hall or rotunda, one hundred feet in diameter, and exactly the same in height. The walls of this classical apartment are ornamented with large paintings by the venerable Colonel Trumbull, to whom I have before made allusion.",224-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty years ago it contained not more than twenty or thirty mean tenements, and its shipping was limited to one small square-rigged vessel. The same place now numbers upwards of seventy thousand inhabitants, and its ships trade to every quarter of the habitable globe. Unlike New York or Philadelphia, the surface of the ground upon which the city stands is irregular. The streets are mostly at right angles, and of a good width; but they are not kept in neat order, and swine innumerable roam at large. The houses are built of excellent red bricks, quantities of which are exported to New York and other places.
 The city contains several handsome public edifices; the principal of which, in point of extent, is the Exchange. This spacious building contains a noble hall for the accommodation of the merchants and others, who meet shaded from the burning suns of summer, or the cold blasts of winter. A gentleman, to whom I expressed my admiration of the beauty of this hall, remarked, as a singular circumstance, and as one that struck him on his travels, that the ports of Great Britain, the greatest commercial nation in the world, with its humid climate too, should not possess any mercantile places of rendezvous of this description open to the public.",257-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The city is almost surrounded by water; the connection with the main land being formed by a narrow strip called the Neck. The communication, in other directions, is kept up by timber bridges; one of which is no less than 1300 yards in length. The older streets are irregular — indeed, as tortuous as those of the old towns of England; but such as are of later date are laid out at right angles. They are kept in neat order; and, unlike the thoroughfares of all the other cities we had visited, they were not perambulated day and night by swine. Many of the original names have given place to others more congenial to the state of political feeling; thus, Washington has superseded Marlborough, and King and Queen have been metamorphosed into Court and State Street...It is not in the interior of the State House alone that the eye and mind are gratified. The view from the lofty dome, by which it is surmounted, is as extensive as it is picturesque; and full of historical interest, as regards the commencement of the glorious struggle, which terminated, happily for mankind, in American independence. At our feet lay the city, with its halls, and its sites, rendered memorable as the places where the intelligence and free spirits of the country discussed their wrongs, or gave vent to their outraged feelings in bold and energetic, yet peaceable remonstrances. Taking a wider range, in one direction the eye rested upon the blood-stained field, where a despotic government was taught, by a severe lesson, to respect the sacred rights of man; while, in another, it gazed upon those eminences, where the military genius of a Washington displayed itself, as if by magic, to the discomfiture of the retiring foe. The wide expanse of the unruffled bay, with its archipelago of islands, the undulated country, sprinkled with smiling villages, and cheerful habitations, together with the bold outline of the distant hills, all combined under an atmosphere as pure as it was mild, produced an enchanting picture, and one which is indelibly impressed on the memory. In front of the State House is a park, many acres in extent, which, in the colonial times, bore the name of the Common; but having been railed, and ornamented, is now dignified with the title of Mall. Here the British troops were for some time encamped; and near a huge and ancient elm, which still spreads its venerable arms, are the remains of a redoubt, thrown up at that period. Among the number of mansions which form one side of the streets bounding this beautiful verdant enclosure, that of the celebrated patriot, Hancock, is distinguished.",273-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/26745/26745.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
