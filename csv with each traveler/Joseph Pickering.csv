After packing my luggage, I went into the town to procure something to eat, lodgings, &c., when I felt myself a stranger, on a foreign, although a kindred strand. After dining heartily on some excellent sausages, with some pleasant mild ale, I took a ramble through the city; but I hardly knew how to walk, the pavement seemed to have the motion of the vessel. Baltimore is a large town, with some handsome public and private buildings; the streets are spacious, airy, and clean; the centres pitched with rock stone, and the side walks paved with red brick, of which also houses are mostly built. Pratt Street, along the water side, was all in a bustle, and apparently full of business, but the method of doing it evidently differs considerably from the manner in England. At one church, and two meeting-houses (no chapels here); some of them elegant buildings, with very respectable-looking congregations. Dined with the captain, whose treatment was hospitable. The manners of the Americans appear widely different to the English, particularly of the females, who are more easy and unembarrassed, yet reserved, in their address, than the retiring diffidence of the latter. Took lodgings at a respectable ship carpenter's, at three dollars, or 13 s. 6 d. sterling, per week, board, washing, and mending including. —A clear, bright, frosty air this morning. Thermometer in my sleeping room 43. Went to the custom-house, with the captain, to clear my luggage. Paid half a dollar to a notary (a very polite, agreeable person) for drawing up an inventory and certificate of my luggage, and 20 cents (one-fifth of a dollar, or about 11 d. sterling) on presenting it, when the only question asked was, Will you swear this is a correct statement, and that the articles are for your own private use? I merely answered in the affirmative. Had a ramble through the town and its environs. Like the appearance of the Americans generally, and think the place prosperous, as tho people appear to be all employed and busy, and have the air of ease and content in their countenances, with but little superciliousness. The markets are well supplied with meat as to quantity, but the quality not quite, so good as in England, excepting the pork, which is fine; some little good beef, but veal and mutton very indifferent, nor is trouble taken to set it off to the best advantage. The vegetables brought to market now are chiefly potatoes, beets, and cabbages, great quantities of the latter, and mostly drumheads; some few carrots, turnips, onions, sweet potatoes, &c. at moderate prices. A great many negroes about the markets and wharfs, who appear far more lively and as independent as the whites, but are treated by the latter as inferior beings; will not eat at the same table, or walk in their company, and have separate places of worship. There are five market houses in Baltimore, some of them large, and all conveniently built, very similar to the old Fleet Market in London. The centres, which are spacious, are occupied on each side by the butchers; on the outside of the butchers' stalls is also a passage on each side, with stalls on either hand, where vegetables, country produce, flour, meal, &c., ready-made clothes, shoes, tin-ware, &c. are exposed. The fish markets are at the ends of the others, and generally well supplied. To-day are their Christmas markets, at which there is great plenty of every thing—some good beef, pork excellent, mutton thin and small, veal (calf) hardly fit to eat, killed too young.",,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13760/13760.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Far enough up the river to be out of danger of surprise from an enemy's fleet; on ground sufficiently high and dry for health, with an easy slope to the water for convenience of trade, &c., and the country round rich and fertile. There are several English families leaving hereabouts, I am informed, for the province of Upper Canada, to procure land of government. Took a walk into the country; the soil in the vicinity of the town is a strong sandy loam; saw some excellent crops of wheat, barley, and rye, partly lodged or laired. Wheat will be twelve or fourteen days before ripe, and rye eight or ten. People busy with their hay and clover, which are pretty good crops, but they have stood till they are too old before cutting, which appears to be a too general practice where I have been; but the heat of the climate, and, consequently, quick growth and ripening of the grass, necessarily prevent the whole being cut down in proper order. Engaged board and lodging at the New England Hotel at 2 s. 3 d. per day. Nothing particularly striking in the town; no elegant public springs or monuments, &c., that I could see, as at Baltimore: streets not so spacious, but more regular and compact than the latter. The country too flat for shew, the finest object being the river and its opposite shore, about half a mile across, with a little island in the middle of it. Steam and team boats continually crossing and re-crossing. They are double boats, or two placed side by side, the paddles working between, with a deck across both, to take waggons, carriages, &c. You may drive into them seated in any vehicle, and out on the opposite side on coming to shore, without the least danger. A large bell is rang every time they make the shore, stop about ten minutes, ring again and off.",28-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13760/13760.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

North or Hudson River runs on one side, and East River on the other, at the end of which they join. A very great number of vessels, of all kinds and sizes, lying at the wharfs on both sides of the town, and a great deal of business going forward, more like London than any other place I have seen. Broadway is a fine street, as are also some others. Markets are well supplied, but appear to be much crowded. At the back of the town there are evident marks of an overwhelming flood. On the highest parts of the island the soil is washed off the rocks, and huge stones laid bare, or tumbled together in the ravines. Another such a place near Trenton, on high land. Almost all the roads leading to a town in America are full of houses on their sides, called “taverns,” or “liquor,” “beer and cake,” or “grocery” stores. My notice was attracted to-day by one with a small kitchen garden before it, with a few benches for seats, with Waterloo Gardens in printed capitals over the gate! as a magnet, I suppose, to attract the contents of Johnny Bull's purse. New York is a place of great trade, and will still increase, it is so well situated. Open at all times to the sea—at the confluence of several fine rivers, and the canal from Albany to Lake Erie greatly augments it. The state of New York is the richest in the Union, and the climate the most genial and moderate for Europeans. The prices of wheat, flour, &c. here, at Baltimore and Philadelphia, are nearly the same. As building in summer is always going on, house-carpenters, brick-makers, and bricklayers, generally find employment almost anywhere, except in the depth of winter, at 4 s. 6 d. to 7 s. or 8 s. per day; also shoemakers, tailors, and persons well acquainted with any useful common trade, may meet with employ in some place or other.",30-1,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13760/13760.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No distant object strikes the eye except the lighthouse, the shores of the lake, and the peninsula on the opposite side of the bay, which are pleasing. The town has been unhealthy till of late; a swamp at the back of it was the cause. It is now drained, and the place is healthy. There are two churches, one of the establishment and the other Roman Catholic, and two or three meeting houses. In Canada, as in the States, the Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists, appear the most numerous, except in particular places, (but I may be incorrect, as I have no data to guide me), yet the Episcopalians, or Church of England Congregationalists, (Independents), and Roman Catholics, are pretty numerous; besides others, such as Quakers, Dunkards, (who are Germans) Universalists, Unitarians, and some new sects, “Davidites,” and Christians, &c. &c.

As you approach the town by Long Island it looks very fine. Point Frederic in front, on which is situated the navy yard, barracks, offices, and houses of the government officers and others, has a very similar appearance, in miniature, to New York and vicinity-Kingston is an old settled place, situated on the west bank of the Catarauqnui river, opposite the naval depôt, over which a large bridge is about to be built of wood. Wooden bridges in this country, generally, are the most proper at present, being more economical, requiring less outlay from the scanty finances of a new country; yet, as there is here such immense rocks, and good building and lime stone, on the spot, (laid bare by an overflowing of the water over the surrounding neighbourhood at some early period), I should have supposed it would have been nearly as cheap, and if so, certainly more desirable for its durability and strength. The harbour is good, and an excellent place for wharfs; but, with the exception of two or three, you run the risk of a broken limb in crossing them. The houses are built chiefly of stone, and generally larger than those in York; the streets are also paved with stones, (in rather a rough manner), which gives it much the appearance of a small-sized market town in England, about 3000 inhabitants. There are a number of good stores; and three or four large druggists' shops, as elegantly arranged as some in London, in all their neatness of order, much better than the general part I have seen in America. A pretty large and handsome stonebuilt church, and another small one belonging to the Establishment, besides Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Methodist places of worship. I like the appearance of Kingston generally, but it is not so thriving as York; and here also there is a little of the American feature before noticed. Houses and premises half built and half in ruins, unmeaning, slovenly arrangements, &c.; but they are fully counter-balanced by a number of specimens of real neatness and order, in different parts of the town, and particularly along the banks of the bay. The military establishment in the neighbourhood causes some little business, yet the inhabitants complain times are not now as they have been. A band of music from the barracks parades the town occasionally at night, playing lively airs. Four steam-boats ply between here and Prescott and up the bay of Quintie (pronounced Kanty, or Canty), besides three to Niagara, York, and Queenston, once a week. Three very large ships of war on the stocks, one above 100 guns, where they have remained since the war. Kingston is inhabited chiefly by Europeans, the greater part Irish, I believe, considerable numbers of Scotch, some Americans, and a few English. With a little of the downright hearty good-feeling of my countrymen, I also witnessed some of the haughty superciliousness of aristocratic pride, and the impudence of pampered menials.

Some of the streets are too narrow, particularly St. Paul's Street, in which a great deal of the wholesale business is done; the footways only three or four feet wide. Some of the streets are tolerably well paved, others roughly; and M'Adamising going forward in some of them. Houses are mostly of stone, neat, strong, and capacious; and if it were not for their high sharp tinned roofs, would have much the appearance of a large town in England. No private warehouses; goods are landed on a high made bank, and in some places on the beach of the river, and then hauled up to the warehouses. The immense accumulation of ice in the winter, has carried away some warehouses that had been built. Several vessels from Europe, and steam-boats, are continually coming and going to various parts up and down the river, and such is the opposition by the two companies that run them between Montreal and Quebec, that each has one boat that carries passengers between the two places, 180 miles, in the cabin, and board, for 7 s. 6 d. , and the deck passengers for 6 d. each only! The most remarkable attraction in the place is the new Roman Catholic Church, the largest in America, and not surpassed in size by a great many in Europe, covering, it is said, an acre of land, and accommodating 12,000 people. It is truly a grand stone building, elegantly and substantially finished.",116-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13760/13760.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The river St. Lawrence is truly called noble, and the scenery in many places along its banks is grand. Passed some smart villages and towns; and the roads are thickly studded with long-roofed, neat white houses; and the, churches, with their tin-covered roofs and aspiring pinnacles glistening in the sun, have an enlivening appearance. It is a pity the river has so many obstructions to navigation at its upper part; as, otherwise, it would be the most commercial stream in the world. There is only one slight rapid between Montreal and Quebec (the Richelieu), or indeed the Ocean, nearly 1000 miles, and that is only difficult for large rafts in adverse winds, its course being narrow, but deep. The tide running a little above it, there is no rapid at high water. Anticosta is a very large island, dangerous to navigation, lying across the gulf. Vessels of any size are now invariably towed up by steamers from Quebec to Montreal. For the timber trade, Quebec is of great and growing importance. This season, nearly 800 vessels have already arrived, and numbers are daily arriving,—too many, indeed, as the lowness of the water in the rivers this spring has prevented a great portion of the best timber being brought to market. The consequence is a rise in price of from 50 to 100 per cent. The best of—the timber growing near the shores of the St. Lawrence and lower part of Lake Ontario, has been brought to market; and when the Upper Canada canals are opened, there will be a fine field for the industrious lumberer , in the immense forests of superior timber, growing on the shores of lakes Erie and Huron, and even Lake Superior, and their tributary streams, which are inexhaustible for centuries to come. The time is not far distant when vessels will be built on the Upper Lakes, 1500 miles from the sea, and freighted thence for Europe and the West Indies. Indeed, one is already built for that purpose, and is now plying on Lake Erie, waiting the completion of the canals. On approaching Quebec, the river for miles was lined along its sides with ships loading lumber. Quebec is situated on a point of land (Cape Diamond), on the north-west side of the river, and opposite to Point Lewis; nine miles above the falls of Montmorency, and five or six above the island of Orleans. The old town is a narrow, inconvenient, and dirty place: it is situated under the immense rocks of hard black stone, which rise almost perpendicularly in some places, several hundred feet, nearly all round the Cape; its length is, extending upwards to Wolfe's Cove (the place where General Wolfe landed on taking Quebec) two miles, and downward to St. Roche, at the month of the St. Charles's River, two miles. Near the latter there are many new wharfs built, some ship-yards, steam, and saw mills, &c. The river St. Charles is a fine stream, running through an extensive vale of good land, open, cleared, and pretty well cultivated, partly by Scotch and Irish. Viewing this vale from the heights of Abraham, in fine weather, awakens recollections of a former view of one of the beautiful champaign vales of England.—The Upper Town is much better built, having wider streets, and is altogether more handsome: it is founded upon the above-mentioned rock, overlooking the Lower Town, the shipping, the country north of the Isle of Orleans, and Point Levi, across the river. The Upper Town is walled in, and is amazingly strong both by nature and art, particularly the citadel, on the highest and outermost point of Cape Diamond, and is still improving. Strangers are not allowed ingress to it, without a ticket. It is a second Gibraltar, and the key of the Canadas. There is a good garrison stationed here, who enliven the place daily with two or three bands of music.",120-1,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/13760/13760.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
