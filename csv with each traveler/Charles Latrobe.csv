Burnside, 1836), 24-8.",London,R. B. Seeley and W. Burnside,1836,Male,England,English,,,1832,,19th century,1830s,40.7215,-73.9948,New York City,"New York City, New York",United States of America,Nothern America,North America,"Much is doubtless to be attributed to the extreme mellowness and transparency of the atmosphere, which gives colour to every object on land or water. In this, the climate of New York is truly Italian. There is a freshness in the verdure that covers the sloping and gentle shores, a harmony in the outlines,—and above all, there is a life in the aquatic scenery, which I never witnessed elsewhere in an equal degree. An air of gaiety and festal enjoyment, which contrasts singularly with the unholiday appearance of men and things in the interior of the country, reigns on the waters of the bays and rivers in the vicinity of the cities to a surprising degree. At all times of the tide, at every hour of the day, whatever may be the wind, the Bay and its outlets appear alive with craft and shipping, from the dark mass of the frigate, or line-ofbattle ship, which often lay moored abreast of the city, and the colossal steam-boats hourly seen careering over its surface, to the light skilfully-managed wherry of the Whitehaller.... At New York you pass hours with delight under the trees on that beautiful breezy promenade, which the good taste of the citizens has preserved at the extreme point of their island. You follow the example of more illustrious travellers in doing justice to the ample tables of your hotel or friends, not forgetting to pass judgment on rock fish, American oysters, and above all, on shad-fish, if in season. You enjoy many a stroll along the gay and cheerful pavement of Broadway, the principal street, running for miles through the heart of the city, with its handsome edifices, shops, and public buildings. You admire the commodious disposition of the interior of family mansions, with their foldingdoors, clean, cool, indian-matted floors, and the groups of pretty faces by which they are adorned. You marvel at the incessant bustle and proofs of flourishing commerce visible in all the narrower streets devoted to business, diverging right and left towards the North and East rivers; and on the crowded slips and wharfs. You step into a steam-boat, and cross over to Brooklyn, or to the Jersey shore, where you may immediately bury yourself in the delicious walks of Hoboken, where 27 the squirrel climbs as free, and apparently as undisturbed among the grape-vines, as in the depths of the forest. You glance up the Hudson, which laves the grassy margin of the promenade, and see him walled in by the perpendicular pallisadoes and green shores of Manhatten Island, covered with sloops and steamers—and own that in your brightest moment of fancy, you never dreamed of the creation of an equally glorious river, or a city whose position is more strongly marked by all those characteristics which are desirable in a great commercial emporium. Returning, you hear the cry of fire, and repair to the scene of disaster, but go home disappointed, because you find that the good people of New York never give a fire a fair chance, but knock down the house to preserve it from the flames. You walk out on a Sunday evening, and are fairly elbowed into the gutter by the broad-spread bonnets and gigot de mouton of the sable beauties, who, with their beaux, have then the possession of the pavement.",24-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in New York and Baltimore, you are surprised with the great proportion of handsome female faces and delicately moulded forms which crowd the public walks and saloons, like so many sweet fresh May flowers. You make the usual visits right or left, dictated by taste or reverence; including the romantic scene at Fairmount, and the spot where the celebrated treaty was concluded between Penn and the Delawares; and you taste that hospitality and frank unostentatious kindness which, with all their faults, proved or imputed, the American ever offers to a stranger who conducts himself courteously.",27-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You admire the neat style of building, —the bustle of the Bay,—the beauty of the shipping,—and the lovely scenery in the environs. You welcome a southern climate in the perfume of many odorous flowers, and, more than all, the delightful society for which Maryland is pre-eminent—frank, polished, and unaffected.",27-8,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precipitous and wooded acclivities of the mountains overhang the wide beds of two noble streams, both interrupted by a long chains of rapids. The picturesque village is situated at the point of junction at the foot of a steep acclivity. A long wooden bridge, resting on stone piers, traverses the united volume of water immediately below, and a mile lower down, the whole, roaring over the Bull's Ring rapid, rushes impetuously through the Gap. The scene presented from the crest of the mountain above the village, of the course of the rivers both before and after their junction, is one of the most striking in the United States. The channel of the Shenandoah to the right, appears obstructed by low reefs of slate rock, as far as it is visible, and that of the Potomac to the left, furrowed by rapids and broken by wooded islands. The mountains overhanging both vallies, are rocky and well wooded, and present fine picturesque scenery along the course of the two canals, which have been constructed for the distance of a mile up each for the convenience of the manufactories of carbines and muskets, established here by the General Government, allured by the defensible character of the position, the vicinity of coal, and great ‘water-power.’ The arms furnished by this manufactory, and another in Massachusetts, supply the whole Union. Neatness and economy seem to characterize every department.",35-6,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A solitary scramble to the summit of the third in rank, situated in the same chain, which I had contrived to accomplish the preceding day, under better auspices, allows me to give you some faint picture of the scenery of the White Hills. As a mountain view, it was truly magnificent, though by far the most gloomy I had ever beheld. The entire group, save five or six of the most elevated mountains, which rear their scalps of micacious rock over a belt of dwarf fir, appears invariably clothed to the very summits with the dense northern forest, and excepting here and there in the deepest vallies, or at such a distance that the gazer could but just detect the difference amidst the blue tints of the horizon, where the swelling surface sank imperceptibly down towards the lower country, the eye was scarcely relieved by the sight of cultivation. No rock could be descried except that which heaped up the highest summits; no bright green pastures were seen on the steep slopes; no white cottages shone like stars from afar; but here and there the precipitous declivities were deeply seamed by tremendous earth-slides, appearing like gashes in the dark face of the mountains. A number of misty lakes gleamed in the distance to the southward, and occasionally you saw the white smoke rising from some upland valley where a hardy son of the soil had pitched his habitation, and began his struggle with the wilderness and its inhabitants.",56-7,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Too frequently you have to remark, in travelling in the United States, how utterly prosaic all the works of man appear; and it is well if there are exceptions now and then, and if you meet with secluded spots where the charms of nature are not blurred by the inharmonious works of human design. The village in question lay niched in the very heart of the wooded hills on the banks of a crystal stream, flowing over a white pebbly bed, with an occasional mass of slate rock peering above the surface. The hills of medium height, rose steeply on either hand, displaying forested summits and sloping green sides denuded of timber, except occasional groups or single trees, and here and there broken by an isolated mass of rock. A conical hill with a solitary tree on its summit overtopped the lower end of the village. The latter was composed as usual principally of one street, with houses irregularly posted, and trees and gardens between. A few of the modern houses had a degree of taste to recommend them, and an old-fashioned cluster of low cottages with open galleries towards the street, and steps down to the level of the road, directly fronted the inn. The church, barn-like as usual, and built with a scantiness of roof which added to its deformity, stood on the verge of a kind of Green, not far from the inn, which was one of the best and most prominent edifices of the place. It had the ordinary appendage of a huge staring sign and lofty sign-post in the middle of the street. The unoccupied spaces and corners in the immediate vicinity of the houses, which, at an earlier day, had doubtless been heaped with rubbish, now bore a rank growth of tall plants, among which the mulberry-coloured blossoms and broad white leaves of the milk-weed were conspicuous. There were charming walks along the river bank under the shade of the forest, which hung over the water from the northern slopes.",58-9,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our stay at Cincinnati was only of two days' duration. We found the good citizens of that rising and flourishing city busily ruminating over the first edition of a well-known picture of their domestic manners, which the English press had just sent forth for their especial benefit. Whether the compote was justly and wisely compounded, I was in no way enabled to judge at the time, but it was very evident from the wry faces on all sides, and the aroused spirit of indignation, that the bitter herbs predominated over the sweet. For the rest, such was the crowded state of the only large hotel in the place, two having been burnt in the course of the spring, that we deemed ourselves fortunate to find a speedy opportunity of departure on one of the splendid steam-boats with which the landing place was crowded.",99,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It lacked, at the time I commemorate, the three last edifices, but was nevertheless a thriving and aspiring place, in its way; and the fortune made here already in the course of its brief existence, by a bold Yankee shopkeeper who had sold sixty thousand dollars' worth of goods here in three years,—was a matter of equal notoriety, surprise, and envy. It is situated about twenty miles east of the Kansas River, and three south of the Missouri, and was consequently very near the extreme western frontier of the State. A little beyond this point, all carriage roads ceased, and one deep black trail alone, which might be seen tending to the southwest, was that of the Santa Fe trappers and traders.",128,,,Library of Congress,https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/lhbtn/6855a/6855a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
