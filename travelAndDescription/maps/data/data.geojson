    "Description":"All the streets are paved with broad stones, and before many of the meanest artificers doors are placed seats of various coloured marbles, so neatly kept, that, I assure you, I walked almost all over the town yesterday, _incognito_, in my slippers without receiving one spot of dirt; and you may see the Dutch maids washing the pavement of the street, with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town seems so full of people, with such busy faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not some celebrated fair; but I see it is every day the same. 'Tis certain no town can be more advantageously situated for commerce. Here are seven large canals, on which the merchants ships come up to the very doors of their houses. The shops and warehouses are of a surprising neatness and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandise, and so much cheaper than what we see in England, that I have much ado to persuade myself I am still so near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be seen. One is not shocked with those loathsome cripples, so common in London, nor teased with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that chuse (sic) to be nasty and lazy. The common servants, and little shop-women, here, are more nicely clean than most of our ladies; and the great variety of neat dresses (every woman dressing her head after her own fashion) is an additional pleasure in seeing the town.",

    "Description":"We take care to make such short stages every day, that I rather fancy myself upon parties of pleasure, than upon the road; and sure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, shaded on each side with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats, passing and repassing. Every twenty paces gives you the prospect of some villa, and every four hours that of a large town, so surprisingly neat, I am sure you would be charmed with them. The place I am now at is certainly one of the finest villages in the world. Here are several squares finely built, and (what I think a particular beauty) the whole set with thick large trees. The _Vour-hout_ is, at the same time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches. There are shops for wafers, cool liquors, &c.--I have been to see several of the most celebrated gardens, but I will not teaze (sic) you with their descriptions.",

    "Description":"If you were with me in this town, you would be ready to expect to receive visits from your Nottingham friends. No two places were ever more resembling; one has but to give the Maese the name of the Trent, and there is no distinguishing the prospect. The houses, like those of Nottingham, are built one above another, and are intermixed in the same manner with trees and gardens. The tower they call Julius Caesar's, has the same situation with Nottingham castle; and I cannot help fancying, I see from it the Trentfield, Adboulton, places so well known to us. 'Tis true, the fortifications make a considerable difference. All the learned in the art of war bestow great commendations on them; for my part, that know nothing of the matter, I shall content myself with telling you, 'tis a very pretty walk on the ramparts, on which there is a tower, very deservedly called the Belvidera; where people go to drink coffee, tea, &c. and enjoy one of the finest prospects in the world. The public walks have no great beauty but the thick shade of the trees, which is solemnly delightful. But I must not forget to take notice of the bridge, which appeared very surprising to me. It is large enough to hold hundreds of men, with horses and carriages. They give the value of an English two-pence to get upon it, and then away they go, bridge and all, to the other side of the river, with so slow a motion, one is hardly sensible of any at all. I was yesterday at the French church, and stared very much at their manner of service. The parson clapped on a broad-brimmed hat in the first place, which gave him entirely the air of _what d'ye call him_, in Bartholomew fair, which he kept up by extraordinary antic gestures, and preaching much such stuff as the other talked to the puppets. However, the congregation seemed to receive it with great devotion; and I was informed by some of his flock, that he is a person of particular fame amongst them.",

This is a very large town, but the most part of it is old built. The Jesuits church, which is the neatest, was shewed (sic) me, in a very complaisant manner, by a handsome young Jesuit; who, not knowing who I was, took a liberty in his compliments and railleries, which very much diverted me. Having never before seen any thing of that nature, I could not enough admire the magnificence of the altars, the rich images of the saints (all massy silver) and the _enchassures_ of the relicks (sic); though I could not help murmuring, in my heart, at the profusion of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, bestowed on the adornment of rotten teeth, and dirty rags. I own that I had wickedness enough to covet St Ursula's pearl necklaces; though perhaps this was no wickedness at all, an image not being certainly one's neighbour's; but I went yet farther, and wished the wench herself converted into dressing-plate. I should also gladly see converted into silver, a great St Christopher, which I imagine would look very well in a cistern.",

'Tis impossible not to observe the difference between the free towns and those under the government of absolute princes, as all the little sovereigns of Germany are. In the first, there appears an air of commerce and plenty. The streets are well-built, and full of people, neatly and plainly dressed. The shops are loaded with merchandise, and the commonalty are clean and cheerful. In the other you see a sort of shabby finery, a number of dirty people of quality tawdered (sic) out; narrow nasty streets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common sort asking alms.",

    "Description":"This town, which has the honour of being the emperor's residence, did not at all answer my expectation, nor ideas of it, being much less than I expected to find it; the streets are very close, and so narrow, one cannot observe the fine fronts of the palaces, though many of them very well deserve observation, being truly magnificent. They are built of fine white stone, and are excessive high. For as the town is too little for the number of the people that desire to live in it, the builders seem to have projected to repair that misfortune, by clapping one town on the top of another, most of the houses being of five, and some of them six stories. You may easily imagine, that the streets being so narrow, the rooms are extremely dark; and, what is an inconveniency much more intolerable, in my opinion, there is no house has so few as five or six families in it. The apartments of the greatest ladies, and even of the ministers of state, are divided, but by a partition, from that of a taylor (sic) or shoemaker; and I know no body that has above two floors in any house, one for their own use, and one higher for their servants. Those that have houses of their own, let Out the rest of them to whoever will take them; and thus the great stairs, (which are all of stone) are as common and as dirty as the street. 'Tis true, when you have once travelled through them, nothing can be more surprisingly magnificent than the apartments. They are commonly a _suite_ of eight or ten large rooms, all inlaid, the doors and windows richly carved and gilt, and the furniture, such as is seldom seen in the palaces of sovereign princes in other countries. Their apartments are adorned with hangings of the finest tapestry of Brussels, prodigious large looking glasses in silver frames, fine japan tables, beds, chairs, canopies, and window curtains of the richest Genoa damask or velvet, almost covered with gold lace or embroidery. All this is made gay by pictures, and vast jars of japan china, and large lustres of rock crystal.",

The opera house, which was built by the late elector, is much finer than that of Vienna. I was very sorry that the ill weather did not permit me to see Hernhausen in all its beauty; but in spite of the snow, I thought the gardens very fine. I was particularly surprised at the vast number of orange trees, much larger than any I have ever seen in England, though this climate is certainly colder. But I had more reason to wonder that night at the king's table, to see a present from a gentleman of this country, of two large baskets full of ripe oranges and lemons of different sorts, many of which were quite new to me; and what I thought worth all the rest, two ripe ananasses (sic), which, to my taste, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are naturally the growth of Brazil, and I could not imagine how they came here, but by enchantment. Upon inquiry, I learnt that they have brought their stoves to such perfection, they lengthen their summer as long as they please, giving to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the sun in its native soil. The effect is very near the same; I am surprised we do not practise (sic) in England so useful an invention. This reflection leads me to consider our obstinacy in shaking with cold, five months in the year rather than make use of stoves, which are certainly one of the greatest conveniencies (sic) of life. Besides, they are so far from spoiling the form of a room, that they add very much to the magnificence of it, when they are painted and gilt, as they are at Vienna, or at Dresden, where they are often in the shapes of china jars, statues, or fine cabinets, so naturally represented, that they are not to be distinguished.",

    "Description":"We continued two days travelling between this place and Buda, through the finest plains in the world, as even as if they were paved, and extremely fruitful; but for the most part desert and uncultivated, laid waste by the long wars between the Turk and the Emperor; and the more cruel civil war, occasioned by the barbarous persecution of the protestant religion by the emperor Leopold. That prince has left behind him the character of an extraordinary piety, and was naturally of a mild merciful temper; but, putting his conscience into the hands of a Jesuit, he was more cruel and treacherous to his poor Hungarian subjects, than ever the Turk has been to the Christians; breaking, without scruple his coronation oath, and his faith, solemnly given in many public treaties. Indeed, nothing can be more melancholy than in travelling through Hungary, to reflect on the former flourishing state of that kingdom, and to see such a noble spot of earth almost uninhabited. Such are also the present circumstances of Buda (where we arrived very early the twenty-second) once the royal seat of the Hungarian kings, whose palace was reckoned one of the most beautiful buildings of the age, now wholly destroyed, no part of the town having been repaired since the last siege, but the fortifications and the castle, which is the present residence of the governor general Ragule, an officer of great merit. He came immediately to see us, and carried us in his coach to his house, where I was received by his lady with all possible civility, and magnificently entertained. This city is situated upon a little hill on the south side of the Danube. The castle is much higher than the town, and from it the prospect is very noble. Without the walls ly (sic) a vast number of little houses, or rather huts, that they call the Rascian town, being altogether inhabited by that people. The governor assured me, it would furnish twelve thousand fighting men. These towns look very odd; their houses stand in rows, many thousands of them so close together, that they appear, at a little distance, like old-fashioned thatched tents. They consist, every one of them, of one hovel above, and another under ground; these are their summer and winter apartments. Buda was first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, in 1526, and lost the following year to Ferdinand I, king of Bohemia. Solyman regained it by the treachery of the garrison, and voluntarily gave it into the hands of king John of Hungary; after whose death, his son being an infant, Ferdinand laid siege to it, and the queen mother was forced to call Solyman to her aid. He indeed raised the siege, but left a Turkish garrison in the town, and commanded her to remove her court from thence, which she was forced to submit to, in 1541. It resisted afterwards the sieges laid to it by the marquis of Brandenburg, in the year 1542; count Schwartzenburg, in 1598; General Rosworm, in 1602; and the duke of Lorrain, commander of the emperor's forces, in 1684, to whom it yielded, in 1686, after an obstinate defence, Apti Bassa, the governor, being killed, fighting in the breach with a Roman bravery. The loss of this town was so important, and so much resented by the Turks, that it occasioned the deposing of their emperor Mahomet IV. the year following.",

This battle opened the first passage for the Turks into the heart of Hungary.--I don't name to you the little villages, of which I can say nothing remarkable; but I'll assure you, I have always found a warm stove, and great plenty, particularly of wild boar, venison, and all kinds of _gibier_. The few people that inhabit Hungary, live easily enough; they have no money, but the woods and plains afford them provision in great abundance; they were ordered to give us all things necessary, even what horses we pleased to demand, _gratis_; but Mr W----y would not oppress the poor country people, by making use of this order, and always paid them to the full worth of what we had. They were so surprised at this unexpected generosity, which they are very little used to, that they always pressed upon us, at parting, a dozen of fat pheasants, or something of that sort, for a present.",

This we found but too true, the woods being very dangerous, and scarce passable, from the vast quantity of wolves that hoard in them. We came, however, safe, though late to Essek, where we stayed a day, to dispatch a courier with letters to the bassa of Belgrade; and I took that opportunity of seeing the town, which is not very large, but fair built, and well fortified. This was a town of great trade, very rich and populous, when in the hands of the Turks. It is situated on the Drave, which runs into the Danube. The bridge was esteemed one of the most extraordinary in the world, being eight thousand paces long, and all built of oak. It was burnt, and the city laid in ashes by count Lesly, 1685, but was again repaired and fortified by the Turks, who, however, abandoned it in 1687. General Dunnewalt then took possession of it for the emperor, in whose hands it has remained ever since, and is esteemed one of the bulwarks of Hungary.",

It seems a strong city, fortified on the east side by the Danube; and on the south by the river Save, and was formerly the barrier of Hungary. It was first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, and since by the emperor's forces, led by the elector of Bavaria. The emperor held it only two Years, it being retaken by the grand vizier. It is now fortified with the utmost care and skill the Turks are capable of, and strengthened by a very numerous garrison of their bravest janizaries, commanded by a bassa seraskier (i.e. general) though this last expression is not very just; for, to say truth, the seraskier is commanded by the janizaries. These troops have an absolute authority here, and their conduct carries much more the aspect of rebellion, than the appearance of subordination.",

The next room is a very large one paved with marble, and all round it are two raised sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling first into marble basons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpose, which carried the streams into the next room, something less than this, with the same sort of marble sofas, but so hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impossible to stay there with one's cloathson.

The gardens take in a large compass of ground, full of high cypress-trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white stone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and spires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Christian-king's palace half so large. There are six large courts in it, all built round, and set with trees, having galleries of stone; one of these for the guard, another for the slaves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the stables, the fifth for the divan, and the sixth for the apartment destined for audiences. On the ladies side, there are, at least, as many more, with distinct courts belonging to their eunuchs and attendants, their kitchens, &c.",

My curiosity supplied me with strength to climb to the top of it, to see the place where Achilles was buried, and where Alexander ran naked round his tomb, in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great comfort to his ghost. I saw there the ruins of a very large city, and found a stone, on which Mr W——y plainly distinguished the words of Sigaen Polin. ... WE saw very plainly from this promontory, the river Simois rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very spacious valley. It is now a considerable river, and is called Simores, it is joined in the vale by the Scamander, which appeared a small stream half choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was Xanthus amongst the gods, as Homer tells us; and 'tis by that heavenly name, the nymph Oenone invokes it, in her epistle to Paris. The Trojan virgins used to offer their first favours to it, by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which Monsieur de la Fontaine has told so agreeably, abolish'd that heathenish ceremony. When the stream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the sea.",

But the large fieldes of the subu-rbes haue deceyued many, beyng dispersed with in maner in-numerable villages, which some haue thought to haue been part of the citie, whiche is nothyng so.

This they did with such effect, that one day I saw some of the ships set on fire by the shells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt... At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the English men of war came into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging myself, and I went often on shore. When the ships were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water I ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on board our ship to dine. On this occasion our ships were dressed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-mast head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a most grand and magnificent spectacle.",

Here I spent my time very pleasantly; I was much on shore all about this delightful island, and found the inhabitants very civil.",

I had often heard of some wonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some white and black people to visit it. When we arrived at the top, I saw under different cliffs great flakes of brimstone, occasioned by the steams of various little ponds, which were then boiling naturally in the earth. Some of these ponds were as white as milk, some quite blue, and many others of different colours. I had taken some potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I tasted some of them, but they were very sulphurous; and the silver shoe buckles, and all the other things of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time, turned as black as lead.",

I observed almost in the centre of the Island however, a very safe Bason, which would admit tolerable large Vessels, and very convenient for boats to land from, and I should think it a snug place to carry on a contraband trade... Within our view was one very well-looking house, which, we were told, belongs to the proprietor of the Island ; and at a little distance, a town composed of hutts with a church. I observed several stack-yards, but neither a tree nor a shrub.",

It does not seem in length above five or at most six Miles ; its breadth I could not see. In the centre is a large extensive plane, surrounded with hills in form of an Amphitheatre; the ground rises by an easy ascent all the way from the shore, and in the bosom of the hills stands a very noble house, round which is a great deal of fine laid out policy. It fronts the shore, and is entirely open to the Sea, and tho' the Island is evidently under the power of winter, the beauty of the Verdure is inconceivable ; and when the Vines, which are now leafless and cut down, are in foliage and fruit, it is certainly a garden that, had our first parents been sent to repent in, they would soon have forgot their native Eden. The hills behind the plane were covered with pasture or Vineyard, and we observed forts on two of them, but no other house of any note, tho' some hamlets were scattered here and there, and what we took to be Orange groves by the figure of the tree.",

We had the Island on both sides of us, yet its beauties were different, the one was hills, dales and groves, and not a tree, plant or shrub I had ever seen before; the ground is vastly uneven, \nbut not very high ; the sugar canes cover the hills almost to the top, and bear a resemblance in colour at least to a rich field of green wheat ; the hills are skirted by the Palmetto or Cabbage tree, which even from this distance makes a noble appearance. The houses are generally placed in the Valleys between the hills, and all front to the sea. We saw many fine ones. There were also some fine walks along the Shore shaded by different trees, of which I am yet ignorant.",

From our situation we had an extensive prospect of that side of the Island, which lay next us, which tho' very beautiful is different from the first view we had of Antigua, which rises on you by degrees.

At last we reached the bay, where we anchored within less than a mile of the Town of St Tubes.The scene altogether was very lively and animating, particularly when joined to the idea of being once more in Europe. The evening was fine, the sun gilding the horizon and giving additional beauty to the green hills. The sky was placid and serene above fifty ships were lying at Anchor, and above a hundred boats en-gaged in the sardine fishing and chanting Vespers. The town was full in prospect and many windmills going above it, which I think a very cheerful object. The coast is extremely bold and the hills and high grounds, covered with wheat or pasture, looked so fresh that they perfectly cheered the senses.",

In consequence of this impediment, vessels which have a draught of above nine and a half feet of water cannot go up to Wilmington, which is the next port above and the most considerable town on the river, even at spring tides, till they are lightened to that draught. Above, or rather at Wil- mington, the Northeast and Northwest branches of the river join. The Northwest is the least considerable, and upon the whole extent there is no town, tho' its banks are very well settled. The first town is Cross Creek, about 100 miles above Wilmington. Here the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on for a great way round.",

From Brunswick to Wilmington there are two roads: one goes up the right side of the river upon which Brunswick stands and crosses two ferries opposite to Wilmington, occasioned by the river being there divided by a large swampy island, through which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half. The length of this road is reckoned sixteen miles. To go by the other road, one must cross a ferry at Brunswick of a mile over, from whence to Wilming-ton it is about ten miles. Every part of these roads is more or less sandy. Some of them for miles together is very deep, as the surface often is a pure white sand, without a particle of soil to bind it together.

The woods in general are in the style of open groves in England, except in such places as have once been cleared and afterwards abandoned. These are always covered with brush. The roads upon the Northwest branch of the river grow more solid every mile above Wilmington, and long before they reach Cross Creek are very hard. The only making they bestow upon the roads in the flat part of the country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth, in as even a line as they can, and where the ground is wet, they make a small ditch on either side. The roads through swamp land are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them cross ways with small pine trees, layd regularly together over sod, with which the logs are previously covered.",

At low water there is ten feet of water upon the bar; at spring tides there is from 19 to 20 feet, so that in fine weather ships of deeper draught can easily go in.

From East to the Mountains beyond the Great Wall it is about 100 Leagues, not comprehending the Mountains to the North of the Great Wall ; for tho they are in a manner uninhabited the Soil is good, there are fine Pastures, Woods, Sprint, and Rivulets of good Water in abundance. Nor do I take in the Country beyond the Kerlon, abounding with Water and Pasturage, tho thinly inhabited, especially the Western Part. The Desart is much larger from North to South, and above 100 Leagues over, in some Parts quite bare, without Trees, Grass, or Water except some Ponds and Marshes made by the Rains, and here and there a Well of Water bad enough.",

It is a regular Octogon with eight Stories, each ol eleven Foot at least, besides the first, which exceeds fifteen without the Coping, so that the whole Height is 100 Foot. This Tower is all of Brick as white as Stone, and well built ; it is embellish’d with several Ornaments of Brick-Work, and a fort of Plaister laid thereon. Its Architecture is quite different from ours, and tho' a little rude, has its Beauty, and pleases the Eye : The first Story is round, and shaped like a Cup, adorn-ed with Foliages ; the rest have eight Fronts, in each of which are two Statues in Demi -Relief, near as big as the Life, but ill done. You go up to the first Story by a Ladder, and there the Staircafe begins. Here probably stood a City, or large Town, for there still remains a wide Compass of Mud Walls, which, tho’ more than half demolish’d, are entire enough to shew that the Tower was built by the Western Tartars , whilst they reign’d in China , under the Family of the Ywen.",

E. till having passed the Point of the Mountain, (which was near our Camp, and lies due West from the Confluence of the little River Tirelki and the Tula) it turns directly West. It is considerably larger than the Kerlon , and its Stream exceeding clear, running over a Bottom of Flints and Pebbles. Its Banks are very agreeable, being covered with various Sorts of beautiful and bushy Trees. In its Course it forms several little Istes, full of most de-lightful GroveS, and we found a Coolness in the Air that was very refreshing in this hot Season. The River is very rapid, and on both Sides without the Trees is a Meadow abounding with excellent Fo-rage. This is certainly the most agreeable Place I had seen in all my Travels into Tartary.",

There are three mosques (jámí) and seven mesjids, three kháns, one bath, two schools for boys, and two hundred small streets; but no room for reading the Korán or tradition, because the greater number of the inhabitants are Greeks. There are fine gardens producing superior figs and grapes. From the excellence of its vinegar, it has acquired the name of Dárkhill (vinegar-house). South-east of the town we passed on horseback continuously through gardens and the cultivated field called Filehdár. The river Nílúfer, not fordable in the beginning of spring, is a clear stream, which issuing from the mountains Rúhbán, Ketelí and Castel, waters the valley of Fillehdár and disembogues into the White Sea. The main road crosses it over a handsome bridge, each arch of which resembles the arch of heaven...",

It is so steep and prominent that the great mosque, the castle and bezestán of Brússa seem as it were sinking into the base of the mountain, and from the summit cannot be seen at all. Rocks towering to the sky take the appearance here of many strange shapes, such as dragons, elephants and eagles. We mounted still further in the direction of the Kiblah through flowery meadows, where no tall trees were to be seen, and after five hours came to the station of Sultán Suleïmán’s fountain-head. A delightful spot with a spring of water so cold that a man cannot take out of it three stones in succession.

It is said that Alexander the Great, when commanded by God to build the wall of Gog and Magog, arrived at this place, he was so much pleased with its air and situation, that he built here a pentagon castle of immense stones (Shedádí, Cyclopean); the room of the diván was paved with rubies, emeralds, turquoises and cornelians, and for that reason was called the Castle Kevherpaí Anapaí. It afterwards fell into the hands of the Genoese, and when Timúr laid waste the towns of Dadián, Heshdek, and other towns amounting altogether to the number of seven hundred, in his expedition against Tokhatmish the Lord of Crimea, he also wasted the suburbs of the castle of Anapa, but the castle itself was spared. In the reign of Sultán Bayazíd II., the great Vezír Gedek Ahmed Páshá, leading the expedition against Kaffa, took this castle also from the Genoese, and put troops into it. It is situated at the extremity of the Cape which divides the territory of the Abáza from Circassia, on a clay cliff; it is a strong castle without a garrison, and has been several times ransacked by the Cossacks of the Tanais. Outside of the castle are one hundred and fifty houses built of reed; this village is called Kabák. North of the castle are the mountains of Anapa. The ships which go to Assov sail past these mountains, which extend as far as the Cossacks of Assov. The castle of Anapa is well built, and in such good preservation, that it appears as if it had just come out of the hands of the builder.",

The windows of the Convent, and of the monument, all look towards the sea. The magnificent kitchen like that of Keikavús is worth seeing; day and night the fire is kept up on the stove for passengers and strangers, they have no endowments but live on alms; they are all purified by mystic divine love. To the right and left of the mountain are many wells in the rocks. The rocks being perpendicular like those of Mount Bisútún are excavated at the base. The projecting rocks are so lofty that ships with topmasts an hundred yards high may enter here, and come to an anchor. The masters of these ships take in barley and wheat which is brought in waggons to the mouths of the aforesaid shafts which are cut in the rock, and poured down them into the holds; these shafts were cut in ancient times by Infidel stonecutters, who were like so many Ferháds; and it is a peculiar sight not to be seen elsewhere, and saves a circuit of between three and four hours in bringing the barley to the foot of the rock. There are no such high and dreary rocks any where in the Black Sea. During southernly and easternly gales, the sea produces a roaring in the excavations, which is heard as far as Iflatár and Ilhánlar near Silistra, a day’s journey from hence. On the top of these rocks are nests of eagles each as large as a sheep, they are even killed and eaten by some for mutton.",

On the borders of the lake there are melons and water-melons of such a size that two make an ass-load. On the lake are from seventy to eighty kaiks and boats, which are employed in the passage from village to village, and for the transport of wood. There are a great number of most delicious fish. Its depth is twenty fathoms, the water is clear and brilliant, and excellent for washing without soap. It is this water which gives a whiteness resembling cotton to the bread Súmúní. On the east side of the lake, at two hours distance, passes the river Sakaria, which disembogues into the Black Sea in the province of Koja Ilí at the place called Irva; it would require but little spirit of enterprise to unite the lake with the sea, by means of this river, a branch of which goes down to the salt-marshes of Nicomedia. As early as the reign of Mohammed III. a great number of workmen were employed in establishing a communication between the gulf of Nicomedia and the lake of Sabánja, but the undertaking was given up at the request of the inhabitants. If the Sakaria were united with this lake, and the lake with the gulf of Nicomedia, this town would be quite an inland port; the timber and wood might be brought down to Bolí, and it would cost no more than five aspers the quintal. God make it easy!\nWe marched to the eastward six hours, along the seashore, through thick forests, called “Ocean of trees,” and crossed the Sakaria by a wooden bridge; this river issues from the mountain Chifteler, passes through Koja Ilí, and goes into the Black Sea near Irva.",

Its source is at the bottom of the pilgrimage of Dúmlibaba, on the east side of Georgia; it flows towards the west, causing in its way many marshes and canals, passes before the village of Kián, the castle of Kemáni, through the Yaila of a thousand lakes, inhabited by the Curds Izúlí, joins the Murád (the name of which it assumes), and passes like a sea in the neighbourhood of Malatia to Samosat, Kala’aí Rúm, Birejík, the bridge Búmbúja, Bálissa, Ja’aber, Rakie, Rahbie, Karkessia, Ania, Hita, Ebyár, Takúk, Helle, and Kúfa; it is joined at Kaverna by the Shatt-ul-arab (Tigris), and thus becomes an immensely large river, which is ascended by Indian ships from Bassra; the whole extent, with all its windings, is four hundred farsangs; it passes four hundred towns and villages. In the plain of Erzerúm its water is very sweet and palatable... The Euphrates freezes in the winter so that during two months many caravans cross it, but it never freezes south of Erzerúm; it is a sweet clear water, and a great comfort to the inhabitants of Erzerúm, though they have the spring, called the Source of Paradise, within their walls.",

The first, which is the Georgian gate (Gúrji), is double, like that of Erzenján; but that of Tabríz, as it is close to the walls of the inner castle, is only a single one. The guns are all pointed towards the quarters of the town Dáragháj and Gumishlí Kunbed. Within the outer castle is an immense tower reaching to the skies, known by the name of Kessik Kulle, on the top of which is a high wooden Koshk; as it is one hundred cubits high, ten guns pointed from thence in all directions, intercept even the flight of birds. The height of the wall of the inner castle is seventy cubits; the other walls are but from forty to fifty cubits high; there are two hundred and ten strong towers, and two thousand and eighty battlements round the castle, and seventeen hundred houses, all covered with earth (terrasses) in the ancient style, so also are all the villages which I saw in the whole government of Erzerúm.",

The third builder of Tabríz was Húlagú, who resided here seven years, and embellished it wonderfully: Mohammed Khodabende Ibzárgún Sháh transferred the whole palace, built by Húlagú, on camels to his new built town. The timber used in the buildings was all cypress and aloe wood, and they have been faced with china ever since. The fourth builder was Mohammed Sháh Ghazán, who extended the boundaries to the mountains of Senján, Aján, and Sehlán, and surrounded it with a wall, which required four days to make a tour of it. The town formerly built by Motevekel became then the inner castle or citadel of the new town. In the year 959, it was taken by Sultán Suleimán, who did not ravage it, but made a present of it to Sháh Elkáss Mirza.",

It has three iron gates; to the south, the gate of Tabríz; to the north, the gate of the Meidán called Yaila Kapússí, on this spot they play Maïl; to the west, the gate of the bridge; there are seven hundred cannons large and small, which remained from the time of the Ottomans, and an immense number of other stores, because it is the frontier of Azerbeiján. It is garrisoned by three thousand men of the fortress, three thousand men of the Khán, and seven thousand men of the province. Sometimes its Khán enjoyed the title of Khán of Kháns.

    "Description":"The Turkish general having convinced himself of the importance of the town of Aras, situated between Genje and Shirván, collected masons and workmen, and enclosed the town with a wall, including the garden Sháh Khiabán, which was outside of the town; three gates led through this wall of clay, the circumference of which is nine thousand six hundred paces. It was finished in forty days, and the governorship, with the rank of a Begler Beg, conferred on Kaitáss-Beg, who had been brought up in the Harím of Sultán Murad. From its situation at the foot of a mountain, the town resembles that of Brússa, surrounded with gardens of fruits and flowers, vineyards and rosebeds. It consists of ten thousand houses with terraces, and forty mosques; in the castle are those of Murad III., of Ferhád Páshá, and of Kara Sinán. The Turkomans and Komúks of Dághistán, pronounce the name of this town Arash. In the beginning of the reign of Sultán Mustafa, this town like that of Merend fell into the hands of the Persians. Forty quarters may now be reckoned, and as many mosques, sixteen baths, eight hundred shops, and seven coffee-houses.",

The town consists of about seven thousand well built houses, stone walls, and terraces, each house provided with water; there is an infinite number of gardens, and twenty-six quarters; the quarters called Meidán and Shabúrán being in the inner castle are the most elegant; there are seventy mosques, the oldest is that of Div Alí, who was one of the Kháns of Shah Tahmáss, but a Sunní; in the suburb is the great mosque of Sháh Safí, which rivals the vault of the palace of Chosroes. In the court-yard is a basin, and round it cells for students; the gates of the mosque of Ferhád Páshá are closed, because it has no endowment; the mosque of Uzdemír Osmán Páshá is a college, where the Muftí holds lectures: there is a dining establishment of Sultán Khodabende’s foundation, forty schools for boys, seven pleasant baths, the best of which is that of Shabúr, with numerous private rooms and a basin, its waiters are fine youths. Besides the public baths, there are private ones in every garden. There are forty caravánseraïs, in each of which many thousand tománs of wares are deposited. The public security is so great, that every man leaves his shop open, without the least danger, when he goes away on business; there are altogether twelve hundred shops. There is no Bezestán of stone, but nevertheless a great number of valuable articles; the coffee-houses are meeting-places for wits and learned men; the air is mild and the land fertile; rice, cotton, seven sorts of grapes, pears, and water-melons are in great perfection.",

    "Description":"Alexander closed this passage with an iron gate, which remained up to the time of Núshirván by whom it was renewed. Jezdejerd Sháh, Ismail Sháh and Uzdemír Páshá repaired the castle situated at the foot of mount Arghan and Deneb. The foundations of the western walls are washed by the Caspian Sea. The walls were built by Herzsháh, as is recorded by the Persian chronostick on the gate of the harbour. The remains of the wall of Alexander also, which was a broad thick wall, are still to be seen projecting from the Sea. If the government would undertake it, it would be easy to extend the harbour from these walls up to the fortress. The length of the wall from the sea to the high mountain is an arrow’s shot, and the breadth of the castle itself is the same. It is built in a pentagon form on a high hill, the strongest I ever saw during my travels; the intelligent architect distributed it into three parts, one of which looks eastward to mount Safah; the second gate is the entrance to the town. In the wall which looks to Mount Arghan are also two gates, and two others leading to the lower town; the first is called Meskúr because it opens towards the district of that name, persons leaving this gate in waggons, may arrive at Shamákhí in three days. Another gate leads towards Kipchák, Crimea and Circassia. In Dághistán, waggons with horses cannot travel, but the roads to Terek, Kazán and Desht Kipchák are all practicable for those vehicles. The third division of the fortress looks towards the sea; it is not so well inhabited as the other two, as the barracks for the garrison are the only buildings.",

Turn the corner from any of the main thoroughfares, and you will soon find yourself in a foul alley of crowded tenements, in the midst of a misery and squalor that wring the heart. You will wonder to see women laughing together and children playing on the damp pavements. It is thin laughter and half-hearted play; and yet, even here, there is a certain air of carelessness and good-humour. It may be that these miserable people do not realise their misery. Cleanliness is perhaps as painful to a person reared in dirt as dirt is to a person reared in cleanliness; slum dwellers, I suppose, do not notice the slum odour; a few decades of slum life must inevitably destroy or, at least, deaden those niceties of smell and taste and feeling which play so large a part in the lives of the well-to-do. And it is fortunate that this is so. But one threads one's way along these squalid streets, shuddering at thought of the vice and disease that must be bred there, and mourning, not so much for their unfortunate inhabitants, as for the blindness and inefficiency of the social order which permits them to exist.",

Drogheda itself is an up-and-down place, built on the side of a hill. I suppose the castle which was the nucleus of the town stood on top of the hill, and houses were gradually built from it down to the ford from which the town takes its name. Encircled with walls and dominated by its castle, it was no doubt picturesque enough, but it is singularly dingy and unattractive now, with slums almost as bad as Dublin's and evidences of biting poverty everywhere.",

Cormac McCarthy built it in the fifteenth century as a defence against the English, and it was held by the Irish until Cromwell's army besieged and captured it. Around the top of the tower is a series of machicolations, or openings between supporting corbels, through which the besieged, in the old days, could drop stones and[117] pour molten lead and red-hot ashes and such-like things down upon the assailants, and it is in the sill of one of these openings that the famous Blarney stone is fixed.",

I picked up somewhere, perhaps from the jargon of the guide, that this wishing-stone is the altar of Fin Barre's old chapel, but I haven't been able to verify this, and it may not be so; but the game is to put up a prayer to the Saint, and make your wish, and leave some token to show you are in earnest, and the wish will surely come true. Of course we made a wish and added some half-pennies to the collection on the altar. In turning over the trinkets already deposited there, we were amused to find two bright Lincoln cents.",

Muckross is far surpassed in interest by many other Irish ruins, but it is very beautiful, embowered as it is in magnificent trees and all but covered with glistening ivy. It is not very old, as Irish ruins go, for it dates only from the latter half of the fifteenth century, when it was founded for the Franciscans. The gem of the place is undoubtedly the cloister, with its arcade of graceful arches ranged around a court and lighting a finely-vaulted ambulatory. In the middle of the court is a giant yew, many centuries old, which spreads its branches from wall to wall. It is encircled with barbed wire, and I don't know whether this is to protect it from vandals, or to protect vandals from it—for the legend is that whoever plucks a spray of this tree dies within a twelvemonth.",

They are lighted on two sides by pointed arches arranged in groups of three, while on the side next the church the arches are grouped in pairs, and the fourth side is closed in by a lovely arcade, with double octagonal columns.

The shrine is hung with rosaries and crowded with figurines and pictures of the Virgin and of various saints, among which, I suppose, the learned in such matters might have picked out Saint Senan, who blessed this well and gave it its miraculous power. The trees which encircle the glade in which the well stands are also hung with offerings—sacred pictures, rosaries, small vessels of gilt, and the crutches of those who came lame and halting and went away cured. On either side of the entrance is a bench where one may sit while saying one's prayers, and in front of the shrine is a shallow basin, some two feet wide and a yard long, into which the water from the well trickles, and where one may sit and wash all infirmities away.",

There were a few people here and there cutting it, but a woman who had got into the compartment with us said that the continued wet weather had made the work very difficult and dangerous. All the people hereabouts, she added, lived by the turf cutting, at which they could earn, perhaps, ten-pence a day; but in bad seasons they were soon close to starvation. I remarked that, with such wages, they must be close to it all the time, and she[268] smiled sadly and said that that was true. Only, of course, in the bogs the children can work, as well as the men and women, and that helps. Indeed, we saw them many times—little boys and girls who should have been at school or running free, gaining health and strength for the hard years to come, tugging at the heavy, water-soaked blocks of peat, and laying them out in the sun to dry. It takes a month of sun to dry the peat; in wet weather it won't dry at all, and so isn't salable. Truly, the lives of the poor Irish hang on slender threads!",

All the women here in Galway were shawled, and beautiful shawls they were, of a delicate fawn-colour, and very soft and thick… A few had carts drawn by little grey donkeys; and the old woman in one of these was so typical that I wanted to get her picture.

Such hotels as those at Bundoran, Recess and Parknasilla—and there are many others like them, handsome buildings, splendidly equipped, set in the midst of beautiful surroundings—leave nothing to be desired. Nor are their rates excessive, considering the excellent service they offer, averaging a little over three dollars a day. In the smaller towns, the tariff is considerably less than this, though the service is almost as good. In places where the railroad does not itself own or manage a hotel, it usually sees to it that at least one under private management is kept up to a satisfactory standard. So no one wishing to explore Ireland need hesitate on account of the hotels. They will be found, with a few exceptions, surprisingly good.",

Two or three miles along country roads brought us to a gate; and here our driver, looking a little anxious, had a short conference with a woman who lived in a neat labourer's cottage near by; and finally he opened the gate and drove through.",

The visitor, expecting to see something magnificent and grandiose, is rather dashed at first to find how small it is; but after a few minutes' wandering over the queer columns of basalt, this feeling passes, and one begins to realise that it is really one of the wonders of the world. I am not going to describe it—every one has seen photographs of it, or if any one hasn't, he will find some opposite this page; and the photographs picture it much better than I can. There are some forty thousand of the pillars, the guide-book says; five-sided or six-sided for the most part, averaging, I should say, about fifteen inches in diameter, and so close together that a lead pencil is too thick to be thrust between them. The pillars are divided into regular, worm-like segments, some six or eight inches thick, and there are quite a lot of segments lying about, broken off from the columns. The whole bed is said by geologists to be nothing but a lava-flow, which broke up into these columnar shapes when it cooled and contracted.",

My own guess would be that these weather-beaten stones, like those others on the hill beside Lough Gill, antedate Ossian by at least two thousand years.

He was garbed as a clergyman, and he wore an Orange badge, and he was listened to with religious attention as he painted the iniquity of the Catholic church and the horrible dangers of Catholic domination. His references to King Billy and the Boyne and the walls of Derry were many and frequent, and he had all sorts of newspaper clippings in his pockets, from which he read freely, and though he was very hoarse and bathed in perspiration, he showed no sign of stopping. He intimated that, once Home Rule was established, the revival of the inquisition would be but a matter of a short time, that no Protestant would be allowed to own property, that no Protestant labourer could expect employment anywhere until he had abjured his religion, that their children would be taken away from them and reared in Catholic schools, and he called upon them to arm and stand firm, to offer their lives upon the altar of their country, and not retreat a step before the aggressions of the Scarlet Woman. I don't know how much of this farrago his audience believed, but their faces were intent and serious, and I fear they believed much more than was good for them.",

The disrobing is done in the outer chamber, which has a low stone bench running around three sides, and then the penitent enters a small inner chamber, descends some six or seven steps into the pool of water, and, I suppose, places himself below the stream which falls into the pool from the end of a pipe. As its name indicates, this well was supposed to have the power of washing away all disease, both physical and moral, and time was when it was very popular. The effect of the cold bath was so exhilarating, and the sudden sense of freedom from sin and disease so uplifting, that the penitents would sometimes rush forth to proclaim their blessed state without pausing to resume their garments. Naturally a lot of impious Orangemen would gather to see the fun; and finally both the secular authorities and the Catholic clergy set their faces against the practices, with the result that they gradually fell into disuse. Only single pilgrims, or small companies, at most, come now to bathe in the magic waters, and their behaviour is most circumspect. The cells, themselves, are well-nigh in ruins. A chapel to Saint Patrick, from whom these waters derive their efficacy, was begun during the day of their popularity, but was never finished, and now only a fragment of it remains.",

There, for a moment, his troops fell into disorder before the fierce attack of the Irish, and as he tried to rally them, a band of Irish horse rushed upon him, circled round him and left him dead upon the ground. Almost at the same moment, the white-haired Walker, who had exhorted the defenders of Derry never to surrender, was shot dead while urging on the men of Ulster. But though the Irish were able to hold their ground at first, and even to drive their assailants back into the river, a long flanking movement which William had set on foot earlier in the day, caught them unprepared, and they gave way, at last, before superior numbers and superior discipline.",

Monasterboice it is called—Mainister Buithe, the abbey of Boetius—and the way thither lies along a pleasant road, through a wooded valley—which, fertile as it is, is not without its traces of desolation, for we passed more than one vast empty mill, falling to decay. Then, on the slope of a hillside away ahead, we saw the round tower, or what is left of it, for the top of it is broken off, struck by lightning, perhaps. But the fragment that remains is 110 feet high! And seeing it thus, across the valley, with the low little church nestling at its base, one is inclined to think that Father Dempsey was not altogether wrong when he said he cared nothing about the theories of antiquarians concerning the round towers, for he knew what they were—the forefingers of the early church pointing us all to God.",

It is twenty-seven feet high, and is composed of three stones, the shaft, the cross with its binding circle, and the cap. The shaft, which is about two feet square and eighteen feet high, is divided into seven compartments on either face, and in each of them is an elaborately-sculptured representation of some Bible scene, usually with three figures. Although much worn, it is still possible easily to decipher some of them, for there is Eve accepting the apple from the serpent while Adam looks mildly on, and here they are fleeing from Paradise before the angel with the flaming sword, and next Cain is hitting Abel on the head with a club while a third unidentified person watches the scene without offering to interfere. At the crossing there is a splendid crucifixion, with the usual crowded heaven and hell to left and right; the binding circle is beautifully ornamented with an interlacing design; and the cap-stone represents one of those high-pitched cells or churches, such as we saw at Killaloe and Glendalough.",

Adjoining the ruins of the cathedral is the ancient and weather-worn “Cross of Cashel,” which was raised upon a rude pedestal, where the kings of Munster were formerly crowned. The ruins are more extensive than anywhere else in Ireland, for Cashel at one time was the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland and its greatest educational centre. Here the Pope’s legates resided and here Henry II., in 1172, received the homage of the Irish kings. But what gives the place its greatest sanctity is the fact that St. Patrick spent much time there and held there the first synod that ever assembled in Ireland, about the middle of the fifth century. That is supposed to have been the reason for the erection of so many sacred edifices and monasteries in early days. St. Declan lived there, too, and commemorated his conversion to Christianity by the erection of one of the churches. Donald O’Brien, King of Limerick, erected another, and his son Donough founded an abbey in 1182. Holy Cross, beautifully situated in a thick grove on the banks of the River Suir, was built in 1182 for the Cistercian order of monks. It derived its name because a piece of the true cross, set with precious stones and presented to a grandson of Brian Boru by Pope Pascal II., was kept there for centuries, and made the abbey the object of pilgrimages of the faithful from all parts of Ireland. This precious relic is now in the Ursuline convent at Cork.",

    "Description":"St. Patrick’s Cathedral is, perhaps, the most notable building in Ireland, and one of the oldest. During the religious wars and the clashes of the clans in the early history of Ireland it was the scene and the cause of much contention and violence. Its sacred walls were originally arranged as fortifications to defend it against the savage tribes and to protect the dignitaries of the church, who resided behind embattled gates for centuries. At one time St. Patrick’s was used as a barrack for soldiers, and the verger will show you an enormous baptismal font, from which he says the dragoons used to water their horses, and the interior was fitted up for courts of law. Henry VIII. confiscated the property and revenues because the members of its chapter refused to accept the new doctrines, and nearly all of them were banished from Ireland. He abolished a small university that was attached to the cathedral by the pope in 1320 for the education of priests. For five hundred years there was a continuous quarrel between St. Patrick’s and Christ Church Cathedral, which stands only two blocks away, because of rivalries over ecclesiastical privileges, powers, and revenues. Finally a compromise was reached, under which there has since been peace between the two great churches and relations similar to those of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s in London. Christ Church is the headquarters of the episcopal see of Dublin, and St. Patrick’s is regarded as a national church. The chief reason why St. Patrick’s has such a hold upon the affections and reverence of the people is because it stands upon the site of a small wooden church erected by St. Patrick himself in the year 450 and within a few feet of a sacred spring or well at which he baptized thousands of pagans during his ministry. The exact site of the well was identified in 1901 by the discovery of an ancient Celtic cross buried in the earth a few feet from the tower of the cathedral. The cross is now exhibited in the north aisle. The floor of the church is only seven feet above the waters of a subterranean brook called the Poddle, and during the spring floods is often inundated, but in the minds of the founders the sanctity of the spot compensated for the insecure foundations.",

In 1172 Strongbow, the Welch Earl of Pembroke, leader of the Norman invasion, swept away the original building to make room for the present edifice, which was fifty years in building. The present nave, transepts, and crypt are those that Strongbow erected, having been thoroughly repaired and restored by Henry Roe, a wealthy distiller, at a cost of £220,000, between 1870 and 1878. In 1178 Strongbow died of a malignant ulcer of the foot, which his enemies attributed to the vengeance of the early Irish saints whose shrines he had violated, and he is buried within the church he built. His black marble tomb is on the south side, with a recumbent effigy in chain armor lying upon the sarcophagus. A smaller effigy in black marble, representing the upper half of a human form, lies beside him and is said to mark the tomb of Strongbow’s son, whom his father literally cut in half with his mighty sword for showing cowardice in battle. Sir Henry Sidney, who discussed the question at length in 1571, declares that there is no doubt that the remains of Strongbow were deposited here, but there is another tomb, with a similar effigy of one-half of his son lying beside it, in an ancient church at Waterford, where Strongbow dwelt in a castle and made his headquarters. The claims of the Waterford tomb are considered much stronger than those of Christ Church in Dublin, because that was where he died and where his wife and family lived after him.",

One of the viceroys of the sixteenth century, in a letter to the King of England describing its partial destruction by fire, wrote that he had “lost nothing but a few barrels of powder and the worst castle in the worst situation in Christendom”. The tower has not been used as a prison since 1798 and 1803, the rebellions of Emmet and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and the documents relating to their conspiracy are preserved there in the very cells where the men who were convicted by them lay awaiting trial and execution. The late Mr. Lecky, the historian, searched them thoroughly, and gave a surprising account of the character of the private papers that were seized with the effects of the patriots in those days. Love letters, poems, reflections on various subjects, rules of conduct, maxims of the sages, drafts of speeches, and proclamations in soaring language, and many attempts at literary work are mixed up with the reports of spies, informers, detectives, and officials,—some of them from comrades whose treachery was never suspected and which Mr. Lecky was not permitted to publish even at this late day. Some people think these malicious and incriminating documents should be destroyed lest they may sometime come to light and ruin the reputation of men who are highly esteemed by their fellow countrymen. But no one seems willing to give the instructions.",

    "Description":"Parnell’s grave in Prospect Cemetery is not neglected, although I have seen it stated repeatedly that such was the case. It occupies the most prominent place in the cemetery, on the western side of the memorial chapel, on a spot corresponding with that occupied by the towering monument of Daniel O’Connell on the eastern side. The grave is in the center of a large circle, surrounded by an iron fence, shaded by beautiful trees, and large foliage plants which were in full bloom. The turf is well kept, and here and there are memorial wreaths preserved under glass globes. In the center of the circle is a high mound, protected by a hedge of arbor vitæ, and ornamented by several rose bushes. The grave is in the center of the mound. At the head is an iron cross six feet high, and at the foot the name “Parnell” is worked out in large letters of box. One of the employees of the cemetery, who showed us around, said that it was the intention of Parnell’s friends to erect a monument to correspond with that of Daniel O’Connell on the other side of the chapel, but after a discussion of several years they had decided to place the memorial downtown at the site I have already mentioned, where it would always be before the eyes of the public. O’Connell’s body is buried in a crypt underneath the monument. His heart is in a casket in the chapel of the Irish College at Rome.\n\nSeveral other famous Irish patriots are buried in Prospect Cemetery, and I asked the guide where the body of Robert Emmet was laid.\n\n“That’s a great sacret,” he answered mysteriously, “an’ I wouldn’t tell it to yer honor avin if I knew; with all respict to yer honor. It woul’ be the same as me life is worth. The soul of Robert Emmet has gone to God. His bones is in the hands of the friends of Ireland, but will remain in their prisint sacred hiding place until Ireland is free.”",

It is like an island of verdure in the midst of an ocean of trade and commerce. On one side of the campus the outside world is kept at bay by a continuous line of dormitories and lecture-rooms which overlook a busy street from the windows of one wall and a peaceful lawn from the windows of the other. On the south side the barrier is a high iron picket fence hidden in a wonderful hedge of hawthorn and laburnum bushes. On the other side of that hedge are shops, and a street-car line that leads to the more attractive part of the city. There are only two entrances to the college green, one at the east end and the other at the west, and it is nearly a half mile walk from one to the other across the green and among the buildings. The main entrance and the main buildings face the Bank of Ireland and look upon Dame Street, which is the Wall Street of Dublin. There is a little green crescent to divide the entrance from the street, with bronze figures of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith, two of the most distinguished of the alumni.",

But I am assured by competent authority that the former and more humane version is the true one, and all agree that ever since those boisterous days every officer of the law who has been caught within the college grounds has been given an involuntary bath from “Old Mary.”",

    "Description":"Trinity College is one of the few great institutions of Europe which give full degrees to women on the same terms as to men. There is no distinction in rules or conditions or in any other respect. Women are admitted to all of the several schools—arts, science, engineering, law, and medicine—on an equal footing. There are now about one hundred in attendance. At first the university gave degrees to all women who could pass the regular examinations, and they came here in droves from Oxford, Cambridge, and other institutions where they had been hearing lectures but are not given degrees. All they had to do was to enter the examinations and fulfill the requirements. But two years ago this practice was stopped, and now no degrees are conferred upon young women who do not take the full course at Trinity. The fees are the same as for men—$50. The women students are mostly Irish, although a few English girls, who are not satisfied with the certificates given them at Cambridge and Oxford, come over here from Girton and other institutions and work for the full degrees of B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and even for diplomas in law and medicine. To accommodate them the university has recently purchased a fine old mansion in Palmerston Park, where fifty or sixty girls are now lodged under the care of a matron, subject to rules similar to those which govern the men students in the dormitories on University Green. Twenty-two degrees were granted to women in 1908, and about the same number in 1907, chiefly in the department of arts, which is the same as our academic courses, and most of the recipients are intending to be teachers in women’s schools and colleges.",

The cars are large and neatly kept, the conductors and motormen are very polite and love to give information to strangers, although they are paid only thirty and thirty-six shillings a week, which would certainly make men of their occupation very reticent in America. The roofs of the cars are arranged with comfortable seats, from which one can see everything within the range of human vision and gratify his curiosity about what is behind the high stone walls, green with lichen and ivy and overhung with lustrous boughs. There isn’t much satisfaction going about in an automobile in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, because the roadways are mere tunnels between walls eight feet high and overhung with foliage, which makes a perpetual twilight, a damp, cool atmosphere, a dustless ride, and a picturesqueness that an artist would admire. The owners of suburban homes have shut themselves in so successfully that nobody can see what they are doing or enjoy the wondrous beauties of their private parks. But the seats on the top of a tram car permit the public to penetrate their secrets, give an abundance of fresh air, gratify the love of motion that we all inherited from our savage ancestors, and enable us to look beyond the barriers into beautiful gardens and groves.",

Nearly every winter’s gale sent a ship or two to destruction, and the bodies of hundreds of poor seamen have been washed up where the children are now playing in the sand. Here and there the skeletons of dead vessels may yet be seen, but the North Bull is no longer dangerous. Modern devices protect navigation, and in the midst of the heather and the glowing yellow gorse golf links have been laid out and a clubhouse has been erected, surrounded by lilacs, laburnums, and hawthorns, now in the full glory of their bloom. It is only twenty minutes’ ride by street car from the center of Dublin, and the business men can come out here to spend the long summer evenings at their sport.",

They were erected early in the nineteenth century as defensive watch-towers, when the country was in dread of an invasion by Napoleon. The name was taken from similar towers in Corsica and Sardinia, where they were erected for protection against pirates in the time of Charles V. These towers are said to have originally had bells which were struck by hammers to alarm the people in case of danger; hence they were called “martello” towers, that being the Italian word for “hammer.”",

The tumuli are scattered over a large area, and, according to the theories of scientists who have explored them, contained the bodies of successive royal families of Ireland until the invasion of the Danes, when they were desecrated, looted, and nearly destroyed, just as the tombs of the kings of Egypt were stripped of their treasures by the Assyrians and other invaders.",

He was buried as he ordered—in the bank of his rath, standing erect, with his shield and weapons, with his face turned southward toward his foes, the Lagenians (Leinstermen). Next northward is Rath na Riogh (Rath of the Kings), probably the oldest structure at Tara, and the royal residence. It is oval, and 853 feet long from north to south. Within its inclosure are: Teach Cormaic (Cormac’s House), a rath with an outer ring, probably built by Cormac Mac Art. Its diameter is about one hundred and forty feet. Next to the northwest, and joined to Teach Cormaic by a common parapet, is the Forradh (“place of meeting”). Its greatest diameter being 296 feet and the diameter of the inner circle 88 feet. To the north of these, but still within the Rath na Riogh, is a mound called Dumha na n-Giall (Mound of the Hostages), on the flat summit of which was probably a house wherein dwelt the hostages often required by the ard-ri of minor kings, of whose fealty he might have doubts. No doubt the hostages of Niall of the Nine Hostages were kept here. To the west of this mound are the remains of another, the Dumha na Bo, or Mound of the Cow. Outside the inclosure of the Rath na Riogh, on the north, is Rath na Seanaidh, or Rath of the Synods, so called because of the synods held there by St. Patrick and his successors, though it is of much older date.",

For ten dollars a month a Belfast mechanic can get a neat and comfortable six-room dwelling, 20 feet front and 36 feet deep, with a garden 100 feet in depth. For five dollars and seven dollars and fifty cents a month he can get four or five roomed cottages that are equally comfortable. And the mechanics there take a great deal more interest in their homes than those in the rest of Ireland. If you will look through the windows as you pass through the streets you will see them draped with neat Nottingham lace curtains and linen shades. There are shelves of books and pictures, neat carpets and center-tables with a family Bible and photograph album and religious newspapers and periodicals. There are often books on theology,—more than anything else,—commentaries on the Bible and other denominational works, for the well-to-do Belfast mechanic is a Presbyterian and always prepared to defend the doctrines of that faith. The manufacturers, the merchants, and the middle classes generally are Presbyterians. The land owners, the professional men, the nobility, and the aristocracy are nearly all members of the Church of Ireland, while the common laborers are Roman Catholics.",

Having taken this oath, “The O’Neill” turned his face to the four corners of Ireland to signify that he was ready to meet all foes from whatever quarter they might come; kissed his sword and his spear to signify that he was ready to use them wherever necessary, and then descended from the stone and was hailed with wild acclamations as the chief of the O’Neills, while his knights knelt before him pledging their loyalty and devotion.",

A stream of lava, at the most twenty-six hundred feet wide and about fifteen miles long, was arrested by some means upon the extreme north coast of Ireland, and in cooling took the form of detached columns from six to thirty feet long and from eight to twenty-four inches in diameter. There are more than forty thousand of these columns in three parallel terraces, standing upright and presenting a smooth surface, but they are all separate and no two of them are of the same size or shape. There is said to be only one triangle, only one nonagon, and only one of diamond shape in all the forty thousand. Most of them are pentagons and hexagons and octagons.",

For there, within the shadow of gaunt and gloomy mountains, St. Kevin, “The Fair Born,” a prince of the House of Leinster, which produced five saints in a single generation, three brothers and two sisters, built seven tiny churches in a group. It is known as the Valley of the Seven Churches. Each of them has its own individuality. Each of them is dedicated to a different saint, and all have been the homes and the places of worship and the object of pilgrimage for holy men and devout Christians for thirteen hundred years. As Sir Walter Scott says, they are probably the oldest buildings now surviving in any country in which the Christian religion was taught, and naturally have a corresponding interest and sanctity to all who love their Lord.",

    "Description":"Curragmore, the seat of the famous Beresford family, is twelve miles in the opposite direction from Waterford, over hill and down dale, and through a most delightful country. It is an ancient place, for the Beresfords are a very old family, descended from Sir Robert la Poer, who landed with Prince John at Waterford in 1185 and was given a vast tract of land that had belonged to an Irish earl who refused to submit to the sovereignty of the Norman king. That was the fashion in those days when people were not so particular about the rights of others as at present. In this highly moral and righteous generation there’s a court sitting regularly to hear any complaints that a tenant may wish to make concerning the rent exacted for his farm or his cottage. A difference of opinion over a bed of turnips or a rabbit or “any other kind of bird” is argued one side and then the other by the lawyers, and many people are questioned to ascertain who is wrong and who is right. But at the date when the first Beresford arrived at Waterford from over the channel, his majesty the king decided the ownership of the territory in Ireland according to his whims. A frown could cost a man a farm and a smile could win him one. But life has not been all sunshine and taffy for the Beresfords. They have had their troubles like the rest of us. In 1310 the wife of John la Poer was burned as a witch—one of the grandmothers of that much beloved and hearty old sailor, admiral of the North Atlantic fleet of Great Britain, who visited us only a few years ago and made so many friends among the people of America.",

The Cork family is one of the most famous in the history of Ireland, although not one of the oldest. The first earl lived on Cork Hill, where the Castle at Dublin stands. He was a native of Hereford County, England, and was born in 1566. He studied law at the Middle Temple, London, and was called to the Bar, but, having no clients, he embarked for Ireland as an adventurer. After a while he obtained the favor and protection of Queen Elizabeth, which enabled him to amass considerable wealth and won him his title. His brother Michael, who went to Ireland with him, became Bishop of Waterford. Richard, a nephew, became Archbishop of Tuam, and his son, Michael, became Archbishop of Armagh.",

It was the site of a monastery established here by Fin-Barre, the patron saint of Cork, who came here about the year 700, built a chapel, and started a monastic school that became famous and attracted many students from the continent of Europe. The city grew up around that monastery and was first composed of students who lived in huts and cabins of their own construction while they carried on their studies. Then business men and farmers began to come in and Cork became a place of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the Danish sea-rovers who, after plundering it again and again, took a fancy to the place and settled down here themselves. St. Fin-Barre was buried in his own church and his dust was afterward taken out of the tomb and enshrined in a silver reliquary which was carried away by one of the O’Briens when he drove the McCarthys, who happened to be a power in 1089, out of his stronghold and looted the place.",

But very few people and only the most daring athletes have ever tried the experiment. The miraculous stone is the sill of a window, which projects from the main wall near the top of the tower. As it is eight or ten inches below the level of the floor and across an open space of about twenty or twenty-four inches, it is not only difficult, but dangerous to attempt to reach it. A slip would send you head first to the ground, one hundred and twenty feet below. The only way in which it can be done is for the person who tries to support himself over the edge of the wall by straps from the top, and, with his face upward, draw himself across until his lips can reach the stone. Almost everybody that visits Blarney Castle comes home with a tale of the time he had in kissing the Blarney stone, but no one has seen him doing so for years, and it can only be done by carrying tackle to the castle. Mrs. Hanna Ford, a gentle and considerate old lady, who has been custodian of the place for more than thirty-six years, told me that she had never known but half a dozen people to kiss the stone in all that time.",

It was thoroughly altered and restored about fifty years ago by the father of the present Duke of Ormonde, and has since been occupied the greater part of the year by the family. Fortunately, in the extensions and restorations, the original character of the structure has been preserved and its individuality has not been impaired. It forms three sides of a large quadrangle with three round towers, castellated in the style of the twelfth century. The dining-hall is one of the finest rooms in Europe and contains many pieces of gold plate, antique ivory, and china that have been in the family for centuries. The picture gallery is a splendid apartment, one hundred and twenty feet long and thirty feet wide, and contains more than one hundred and eighty pictures, including family portraits by Van Dyck, Holbein, Lely, Kellner, Reynolds, and others, and gems of Murillo, Correggio, Salvatore Rosa, Claude Lorrain, Tintoretto, and other great masters. In the drawing-room is a picture of the Virgin and Child, by Correggio, which was presented to the second Duke of Ormonde by the Dutch government in recognition of his services in the Low Countries during the reign of Queen Anne. The garden and the park are superb and the family are generous enough to permit the public to share in their enjoyment of them.",

As it was a holiday, all the people in the neighborhood were gathered at Cronin’s Inn when the two coachloads of passengers drove in from Macroom, and several of them accompanied us across to Gougane Island and told us the history of that sacred place. There was an old man with bog-oak walking sticks to sell, and boys with post cards, for there isn’t a spot in Ireland that hasn’t been photographed and transferred to a post card in hideous colors. Mr. Benjamin Shorten, a man of importance in the community, had hailed the coach when it passed his house, and was therefore not only an entertainer but a fellow-passenger of the strangers within his gate. And it was a strange story that he told us of the restoration of the ruins and the erection, by Mr. John R. Walsh of Chicago, in memory of his parents, of the little shrine on the site of St. Fin-Barre’s oratory which had been blessed by St. Patrick fourteen hundred years ago.",

The name signifies “a rough glen,” and that describes it exactly—a deep cleft in the mountains, a gash which some irresistible glacier made ages ago in the rugged rocks, about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, which terminates upon an exquisite little sheet of water, a branch of the Bay of Bantry, on the far southwestern coast of Ireland. The glen is filled with wonderful trees and wonderful flowers, which seem to bloom perennially. The surrounding mountains are of the wildest description, being naked moorlands covered with heather and gorse and huge gray bowlders and peaks which project into the air. Among them, it is said, there are no less than 365 little lakes, that number having suggested to the pious peasants, who attribute everything to apostolic interposition, that some holy saint prayed effectually for a separate one to supply water for each day of the year. The rocks reach far away to the westward and down into the cold blue of an uneasy ocean, which beats impetuously upon the outer walls, but the water is seldom disturbed by more than a ripple within the bay. For a combination of ocean, mountains, lakes, rocks, waterfalls, forests, and flowers I have never seen the like, and any one can easily understand why Glengariff is called the most beautiful spot in Ireland.",

There is a long extension, however, entirely in ruins, but it gives an idea of the enormous dimensions of the castle. It was surrounded by outworks of great strength, and you can see traces of the round watch towers at the angles. A stone staircase leads to the top of the tower, where a beautiful view of the country can be obtained. Few ruins in Ireland are so extensive and so well kept.",

    "NameOfTraveler":"William Eleroy Curtis",
    "YearOfTravel":1908,
    "Description":"Muckross Abbey ranks with Melrose Abbey in Scotland and Kenilworth Castle in England as among the most picturesque and interesting ruins in the world. The walls and the Gothic windows, the tower and several other distinctive features are well preserved, and the ivy drapery makes it an exquisite picture. The abbey stands within the park of two hundred and ninety acres that surrounds Muckross House and is the property of Lord Ardilaun, who has many beautiful places in different parts of Ireland, and cannot possibly enjoy them all; but none is so beautiful as Muckross House. He purchased the property of the Herbert family who inherited it from Florence MacCarthy More, who, in 1750 married Agnes, daughter of Edward Herbert of this county, and they had one son who was the last MacCarthy More in the direct line, and that famous family became extinct, for he died without issue in 1770, and the estate passed into the possession of his mother’s family, being the nearest relatives. The Honorable Arthur Herbert died in 1866, and a beautiful Celtic cross has been erected to his memory upon the highest hill in the neighborhood, overlooking the park that he prized so highly, and where he enjoyed so much pleasure. His widow and daughters lived there for thirty years until they expired, when the place was offered at auction and Lord Ardilaun bid it in for £63,000 for the estate, and paid £10,000 more for furniture, pictures, live stock, and other property, making it cost him altogether about £73,000. And now he offers it for sale—the whole thing, a house of thirty-two rooms, a park of two hundred and ninety acres, the ruins of Muckross Abbey, and history and legends galore—for £75,000. And perhaps he would take less from the proper person. In 1907 a syndicate was organized to purchase the place and turn it into a Monte Carlo. They proposed to make the handsome old mansion a gambling-house and erect a large hotel with all possible allurements near by; but when Lord Ardilaun learned of the scheme, he instructed his solicitors to insert in the deed a clause stipulating that it should be used for residential purposes only, and that made it worthless to the syndicate. So Muckross Abbey and its beautiful surroundings are still in the market.\n\nThe abbey dates back to the dawn of Christianity in Ireland, and its site was originally occupied in the fourth or fifth century by a monastery founded by St. Finian of Innisfallen and his monks. The present building, however, was erected by Donald MacCarthy More, Prince of Desmond, in 1330, and was finished by his son in 1340 for the Franciscan friars, who occupied it as a monastery and as a college. There was some kind of an institution on the same site between the monastery of St. Finian and the present one, for an ancient manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, gives an account of its destruction by fire in the eleventh century. The founder, Donald MacCarthy More, built the beautiful chapel as a burial place for himself and his posterity. It is also the burial place of the O’Donaghues of the Glens, and in the very center of the choir is a large square tomb in which was deposited the body of “The Great O’Donaghue,” the chieftain of the lakes, of whom Mr. Maurice R. Moriarity, the custodian, gives many interesting legends in his history of the ruins.\n\nThe O’Donaghues were connected by marriage with the MacCarthys, kings of Munster, and had their headquarters at Blarney Castle, near Cork. Twelve generations, so far as the inscriptions can be deciphered, of that proud family are lying there, and more than twenty generations of O’Donaghues. The last MacCarthy buried here was Florence, husband of Agnes Herbert, who lived in Muckross House until his death in 1770. The last O’Donaghue buried here was Donal, a direct descendant of The O’Donaghue of the Glens, who was a member of parliament and died in 1889. His son Jeffrey, “The O’Donaghue,” as the head of the family is always called, is a barrister living in Dublin, a gentleman of high reputation and much influence, although he has lost almost everything but his proud name and a lineage that is interwoven with the history of Ireland since human actions were recorded.",

The village of Adare has about six hundred people living in model cottages, which he and his father built for them, with vegetable and flower gardens and everything that an Irish peasant could ask for, including both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. The former was once “The White Abbey,” founded by the Augustinians in 1230 and restored by the Earl of Dunraven in 1811 with great care. A portion of the monastery has been rebuilt for a national school and given to the Roman Catholics. The neighboring Franciscan Abbey, founded in 1315, was restored for use as the Protestant church in 1807. The Earl of Dunraven who lived in those days built a family mausoleum in connection with it, and turned the refectory of the monks into a schoolhouse for Protestant children. Although the earls of Dunraven have been members of the Church of Ireland, they have been generous and frequent benefactors of the Roman Catholic church, and there seem to have been successive generations of wise, thoughtful, and considerate men in that family.",

    "Description":"Galway is a foreign-looking little town, unlike any other we saw in Ireland, and much of the architecture is Dutch and Spanish, departing from the plain, ugly brick front without cornice or eaves which is so common elsewhere. The streets are irregular and run all sorts of ways; some very narrow and some very wide, and they vary in width at different places, with occasionally an odd-shaped space at the intersection. Everything looks old and shabby and out of repair. It is queer as well as significant to see buildings half in ruins in the principal streets and others with the glass broken out of the windows. There are some smart-looking shops, however, and neatly kept residences, but they are not frequent. Nor is the town well kept. The Common Council evidently lacks a sense of the æsthetic, because the streets are dirty, the park is scraggly, and the grass and trees are very much neglected. It is altogether the untidiest public park I saw in Ireland. Many of the people we met on the principal streets, particularly the women, are repulsive in their rags and dirty faces and unkempt hair and bare feet. We saw a few barefooted women in Tipperary and Limerick, but in Galway none of the working women wears shoes, although the men seem to be well shod. The women cover their heads with thick shawls that are often greasy and torn, and their faces show evidences of sorrow and privation, and perhaps other causes have left a mark.",

    "Description":"The scenery in Connemara reminds one very much of Norway except in the lack of the cleanliness for which the latter country is famous. The coast line is cut by deep jags and precipitous cliffs, like the fiords, and the mountains have the same stern and stony appearance, and the peat bogs that lie between them are similar to those in the Scandinavian countries, although the climate is much milder here. The fuchsia plant is commonly used for hedges, which all summer long is loaded with blossoms of purple and red. I had never seen a fuchsia hedge until I came to Ireland. The first was at Glengariff, on the southern coast, but since then we have found them everywhere along the Atlantic shore, in the western counties, hundreds of miles of them, inclosing pastures, meadows, and gardens and growing with wonderful luxuriance.",

In the Town there is neither Fort, nor Castle, nor scarce any people of warlike mindes.

An other street is situated on the hill side towards the River; because at the building thereof, there were many Pine trees, they named it Ocotelulco, which is to say, A pine apple plot. This street was beautifull, and most inhabited of all the Town, and there was the chiefest Market place, where all the buying and selling was used, and that place they called Tianquiztli; in that street was the dwelling house of Maxixca. Along the River side in the plaine standeth another street called Tizatlan, because there is much Lime and Chalke. In this street dwelled Xicotencatl, Captaine Generall of the whole Common-wealth. There is another street named by reason of the brackish water, Quiahuiztlan; but since the Spaniards came thither, all those buildings are almost altered, after a better fashion, and built with stone. In the plain by the riverside standeth the Town house, & other Offices, as in the City of Venice.",

And so is almost all Mexico new built with very faire and spatious houses with Gardens of recreation. Their buildings are with stone, and brick very strong, but not high, by reason of the many Earth-quakes, which would indanger their houses if they were above three stories high. The streets are very broad, in the narrowest of them three Coaches may goe, and in the broader six may goe in the breadth of them, which makes the City seeme a great deale bigger then it is. In my time it was thought to bee of betweene thirty and forty thousand Inhabitants Spaniards, who are so proud and rich, that half the City was judged to keepe Coaches, for it was a most credible report that in Mexico in my time there were above fifteen thousand Coaches. It is a by-word that at Mexico there are foure things faire, that is to say, the women, the apparell, the horses, and the streets. But to this I may adde the beauty of some of the Coaches of the gentry, which doe exceed in cost the best of the Court of Madrid and other parts of Christendome; for there they spare no Silver, nor Gold, nor pretious stones, nor Cloath of Gold, nor the best Silkes from China to enrich them.",

Some Hides, some Sugar, and some Tobacco are the chiefe commodities from thence. There are only two Townes of note in it, Oristana and Sevilla; here are built ships which have proved as well at sea, as those that are made in Spaine. This Island was once very populous, but now is almost destitute of Indians; for the Spaniards have slain in it more then 60,000; in so much that women as well here as on the Continent did kill their children before they had given them life, that the issues of their bodies might not serve so cruell a nation.",

It is reported for certaine that here in twenty daies herbes will ripen and roots also and be fit to be eaten, which is a strong argument of the exact temperature of the aire. It yeeldeth in nothing to Cuba, but excelleth it in three things especially; first in the finenesse of the gold, which is here more pure and unmixed; secondly, in the increase of the Sugar, one Sugar Cane here filling twenty and sometimes thirty measures; and thirdly, in the goodnesse of the soile for tillage, the corne here yeelding an hundred fold. This fertility is thought to be caused by four great rivers, which water and enrich all the four quarters of the Island; all four doe spring from one only mountaine, which standeth in the very midst and center of the Country, Juna running to the East, Artihinnacus to the West, Jacchus to the North, and Naibus to the South.",

From this Valley unto Guatemala, neither is there any ascent or descent but a plaine, broad and sandy way. The eye hath much to view, though compassed with Mountaines, in these two last leagues; for yet it may behold a Town of Indians which taketh up most of the way, and is counted as big as Chimaltenango, if not bigger, the houses lying scattered with a distance one from another, mingled with many fair buildings of Spaniards, who resort much thither from the City for their recreation. This Town is called Xocotenango, of a fruit named Xocotte, which is most plentifull there, and all about the Country; it is fresh and cooling, of a yellow colour when ripe, and of two sorts, some sweet, and others sowre, of the stones whereof the Indians make a fire; they lie so thick in the way, dropping from the trees for want of gathering and spending them all, that the Spaniards have begun to practise the buying of Hogs on purpose to let them runne about that high way, finding that they fat as speedily and as well with those plummes, as our Hogs doe in England with Akorns. All this way are also many faire gardens, which supply the Markets of Guatemala with herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers all the yeer. There are further in this Rode three water mills for the corn of the City, whereof the chief and the richest belongs to the Dominican Fryers of Guatemala, who keep there a Fryer constantly with three or foure Blackmores to doe and oversee the worke; What will not those Fryers doe to satisfie their covetous mindes? Even dusty Millars they will become to get wealth. The Frontispice of the Church of this Town is judged one of the best pieces of worke thereabouts; the high Altar within is also rich and stately, being all daubed with gold.",

With this my high conceiting thoughts stooped down to think of some second Chiapa; till having continued on a while by houses on my right hand and dunghils on my left, I came to a broader street having houses on each side, which seemed to promise a City at hand.",

Though the mountaines on each side doe strongly environ it, and especially on the East-side seem to hang over it, yet none of them are hinderers to Travellers, who over them have opened waies easie for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts. The way from Mexico, if taken by the coast of Soconuzco, and Suchutepeques comes into the City North-west-ward, which is a wide, open and sandy rode; if it be taken by Chiapa, it lieth North-east, and entreth into the City between the mountaines, as before hath been noted. West-ward to the South-sea the way lieth open through the valley and a champaigne Countrey. But South or South-East, the entrance is over high and steepy hils, which is the common Rode from Comayagua, Nicaragua, and the Golfo dulce or sweet Gulfe, where the ships come yeerly and unlade all the Commodities which are brought from Spaine for Guatemala. This also is the way followed by them who take a journey meer East-ward from this City. But the chiefest mountaines, which straighten in this City and valley are two, called Vulcanes, the one being a Vulcan of water, and the other a Vulcan or mountain of fire, termed so by the Spaniards, though very improperly a Vulcan may be said to containe water, it taking its name from the heathenish God Vulcan, whose profession and imployment chiefly was in fire. These two famous mountaines stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the valley; that of water hanging on the South-side almost perpendicularly over the City, the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old City. That of water is higher then the other, and yeelds a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the yeer green, and full of Indian Milpa's, which are plantations of Indian wheat; and in the small and petty Townes which lie some halfe way up it, some at the foot of it, there are Roses, Lillies, and other flowers all the yeer long in the gardens, besides Plantins, Apricockes, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits.",

These Indians are somewhat of more courage then those of other Townes, and in my time were like to rise up against the Spaniards for their unmercifull tyranny over them. The Churches are exceeding rich; in the Towne of Santiago, there was living in my time one Indian, who for onely vaine-glory had bestowed the worth of six thousand Duckates upon that Church, and yet afterwards this wretch was found to bee a Wizard and Idolater. These Indians get much mony by letting out great tuffes of feathers, which the Indians use in their dances upon the feasts of the Dedication of their towns.

I fried a young \"purp \", but the idea of eating dog meat rather set our stomaches against it. We are camped for the night at a clear slough of water, but I must give you a discription of these funny little animals, and their cities or communities They are a species of the \"mar- mot\", about as large as a guinea pig, of a brown or sandy color with heads like a terrier pup, which, I supose, has given them the name of dogs. They have a short stumpy tail, which is kept in a perpetual jerk when they are excited. They select for their city a level sandy plain, where they can easily dig their burrows. Their towns often rival in population the largest cities in Europe. There is frequently considerable regularity in ther streets. Their houses consist of little mounds, often two or three feet high, with a hole in the center, two or three feet deep vertically. Then extending to their apartments. As soon as they see such a monster as man, each one scampers off to his own house, and squats down in his hole, peeping out and barking lustily at the intruder, till he approaches too close, when they suddenly turn a sumer sault in to their burrows. If you are still, in a short time, they will look out again to reconnoiter. What is very strange, the owl and rattle snake are their constant companions, but we surmise for no good purpose, no doubt only to devour young pups.",

Prickly pears and sage brush are growing all along the road to-day. The Platte valley produces some very fine flowers, among which, are several varieties of the prickly pear, or cactus, which are now in bloom. The one, which is common in the states covers acres upon acres, and bears a rich yellow flower about the size of the palm of the hand. Some few are of a dark buff color, others some are tinted with various colors. The finest is a green prickly bulb, half imbeded in the sand bearing a bright red, many-leaved, rose-like flower, which is very handsome indeed. This cactus is known by the common name, as the \"melon thistle.\" In warm climates the prickly pear bears an excellent fruit, but I've heard no one say that the fruit comes to perfection so far north, yet I know of no reason to the contrary, unless, it is the shortness of the season. The roads being very bad we camped early, making only 15 miles. Those who went back to the bluffs have been winding their way over hills and ravines, sometimes in full view, sometimes out of sight. They can't come down to the river, and we hear that they are suffering for water.

One mistep of the horse would precipitate all into the deep water below. -- Afterwards we heard that a four mule team went over this bank the same day.\nJune 26 - We laid over to day having good pasture. Baked bread and pies in the fournoon. In the afternooon I mended our enameled cloth, which had got badly torn a few days ago in a gust of wind. The boys gathered some wild currants. I cooked them, but we did not relish them. This is the only kind of fruit we find on the way, except one day I saw some huckel berries growing on the mountain side. I often think of the fine fruit at home and the garden vegetables which I could relish more than any thing else Had a pleasant day. Could see hundreds of wagons passing on the South side of the river many were also passing on this side.",

It is a peculiar stream, ever shifting among numerous Islands, and in the dry part of the sea son it is almost lost in its deep sand bed. Although it bears no vesels upon its wide and rippling surface, yet it is of vast use to the emigrants and settlers on its banks. Rushing down from its snowy mountain sources, it bears its cooling waters through sandy plains and fertile meadows furnishing water and grass for the weary emigrants winding their way along its banks towards the far sundown of Uncle Sam's dominions. Good roads this morning but no water, travelled on till 2 o'clock p.m. to reach willow springs. Some of the teams were were about fagged out. Here we found about (500) hundred wagons camped, and had to wait our turn for hours to get our stock watered. There is no grass here, but some of the boys went back on the bluffs and found plenty so we concluded to lay over. We had a hard gust of wind which blew the sand into our faces till we were nearly suffocated.",

It is very difficult of ascent to the top of this gate owing to the numerous deep fissures among the craggy rocks Mr Dunlap and two others of our party made the difficult ascent and described the scene as grand and awful.

The scenery is beautiful, grand, often sublime. On either side, snow-capped mountains rear their tops to the clouds, their sides being robed in evergreens of pine and cedars while at their base nestles a rich herbage of vegetation, and varigated flowers, filling the air with rich odors, and here and there beautiful springs of pure crystal water, gush forth inviting the weary \"pilgrims\" to satisfy their thirst. [...] Passing out of this cañon, the road winds through heavy forests of pine and tamaracks, going down steep after steep, among rocks and loose stones till it again reaches another cañon, through, which, dashes another mountain stream. It was dark when we arrived in this cañon, and here, in a narrow place, with scarsely a mouthful of grass, we, with many others, are compelled to camp.",

The name it bears, and which has been given to it by modern travellers, has no connexion with its origin. Indeed, if we may credit Greek inscription, this monument is no older than the time of Dioclesian. It has a slight inclination to the South. The capital and base have never been finished. I did not measure its height; but it is loftier by two-thirds than the palm-trees around it. Cleopatra's Needles, of which one (as I before re- marked) has fallen, are obelisks of red granite, having three columns of hieroglyphics on each side. [...] The antique thimbles, which served for the base of these obelisks, still re- main; they rest on socles of three steps, are of Greco- Romanic construction, and confirm the architectural date of the received tradition, which affirms that their second erection occurred about forty years before CHRIST.",

Occasionally we were blind- ed by gusts of hot wind mixed with dust; and we knew, from the momentary oppression at our lungs, as it passed, that we were encountering the burning breath of the Desert. Here and there, on either hand, were circular villages, built on the rising ground, which, during the overflow of the Nile, be- come islands. The houses are of a conical form, built of brick and earth, and pierced with small, square holes, designed to admit just as much light as is strictly necessary, with just as little heat as possible. At intervals, too, we passed several isolated tombs of hermits and dervises, each shaded by a palm tree; that consecrated friend of the sepulchre, around the tops of which clouds of shrieking hawks flew at our approach.",

    "Description":"... at five hundred paces distance from Damanhour, were in the midst of the Desert, - so closely do the extremes of civilization and desolation approximate in this eastern world.\nWe trudged along for several hours through the sand ; and then, ascending a hill, we unexpectedly saw from its summit the Nile !\nDelightful landscapes now succeeded arid plains. In place of a palm-tree here and there lost in the burning horizon, we found forests of fruit-trees and fields of maize. Egypt is a valley, with a river in its centre and an immense garden on each side, shut in by the Desert. Birds of ruby and emerald, of brilliant song and plumage, unknown to us, fill the groves of mimosa and lilachs. Large droves of sheep and buffalo, led by lean, naked herdsmen, followed the course of the Nile which we were ascending. And, finally, by way of climax, two enormous wolves, attracted no doubt by the scent of the cattle, emerged from a wood fifty yards in front, and came to a halt as if to arrest our progress : our guides, however, succeeded in beating them off with stones. Night descended rapidly, and our way, intersected by ditches necessary to the irrigation of the country, became more and more toilsome. In many places our asses sunk to their knees in the swamps, and we were obliged to dismount; and occasionally we ford- ed actual torrents, wading to our armpits : this sort of bath, though much cooler, was also much less agreeable than that of Alexandria. At length the moon arose in full brilliancy, illumined our path, and gave a new character to this strange landscape. Despite our embarrassments, we could not be insensible to its beauties. On the summit of the hills which divide the valley from the Desert, the palm-trees gracefully waved their branches against the sky. Mosques were visible in every direction, their bases laved by the Nile, their walls surrounded by the shade and verdure of the sycamore. But we were constantly interrupted in our ecstacy, by a bog or a ditch ; so that, by the time Rosetta was in sight, we were drenched altogether, and our shoes, like Panurge's, took in water from our shirt-collars.",

A dome in the form of a heart reversed, surmounted by a crescent, crowns its white and festooned walls : from one of the angles, a madeneh of rare elegance elevates its galleries, while the opposite side seems to uphold an enormous mass of sand, resting like a hill on the declivity of the mountain. Tall palm- trees, also, shoot up their single stems through the thick and sombre foliage of the sycamores, crowning them as with an aigrette. The true believers say that the holy dervise, Abou-Mandour, sustains on his shoulders the mountains of sand which seem ready to swallow up the mosque, and choke the current of the Nile.",

    "Description":"Towards the close of the third day, after we had encountered divers head winds and shoals, three symmetrical mounds arose slowly under the glowing horizon; they were the Pyramids : and, at the same time, on our left, commenced the chain of Lybian mountains which enclose the Nile with their granite flanks. \nWe were unable to turn away from the gigantic monuments to which belonged so grand a record of antiquity, and so glorious a memento of modern days. There, too, was the battle-field of the modern Cambyses, where we, like Herodotus viewing the corses of the Persians and Egyptians, might have discovered the bones of our fathers. As the sun descended, his beams climbed the sides of the Pyramids, leaving their base in shade ; soon the summit alone sparkled, like a reddened point, and then a single ray, like a dis- tant beacon-light, seemed to float on the sharpened extremity. This soon detached itself and ascended towards the sky, as if to light up the stars, which, a moment after, began to twinkle in the firmament.",

At the foot of the Lybian range we began to perceive, through the sandy va- pours that darkened the air, the towers and domes of mosques surmounted with their crescents of bronze. By degrees this curtain, driven by the northern wind which wafted us along, was uplifted from Cairo, and we discovered the jagged outline of the tops of the buildings, their foundations being yet hidden by the swollen banks of the river.",

The lines traced on it indicate the years when the overflow of the water, reaching an unusual elevation, causes seasons of remarkable fertility. Here, every year, the sheiks of the mosques declare the height of the inundation, and apportion the measure of rejoicing which the people may indulge in ; or, with the resignation of Mussulmans, announce sterility and the fasting and famine to which the insufficient rising of the river condemns them. On our right stood the Pyramids of Gizeh, visible from the base to the summit; and there, too, was the hill formed by the Great Sphinx, which has guarded them for three thousand years, turning its granite face, mutilated by the soldiers of Cambyses, towards the tomb of the Pharaohs. On our left, was the bat-tlefield of Heliopolis, rendered famous by Kleber; its immense solitude extends farther than the eye can reach, and is enlivened by one sycamore which flourishes in the burning sand of the Desert.",

We sped through sumptuous bazaars, and streets crowded with Arabs and tents, until we arrived at the gigantic mosque of the Sultan Hassan. We next took the steep path leading, first, to Joseph's Divan, near which is a famous well, described to us by M. Taylor.

It is dug through a solid rock, in which also are steps for the descent: this stair-way is lighted partly by windows through the sides of the rock, and partly by torches.",

    "Description":"We had been seeing some sea-fowl as we went along ever since we started, and these became more numerous and diverse in kind the farther we ran down our longitude; so that we observed the greatest care in our navigation by day, and especially by night.\nBut all our watchfulness did not Isle of prevent us from discovering, at daybreak on the 28th of October, and already astern of us, a very flat palm-covered islet, which we must perforce have passed very close to in the course of the night. We made every endeavour to come up with it, but did not succeed until the third day ; when, having seen it to be inhabited, because of some big smokes they made, we got the boat into the water and she went away to reconnoitre the island with Lieut. Don Thomas Gayangos (and thenceforward every time the boat made a trip we went in her by turns) and her crew with their arms and other usual precautions. They examined the greater part of it, but found no spot where they could land, as the island is fringed all round with a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, making it impossible to get close in without involving great risk to the boat and crew. [...] From 26 to 20 Indians followed along the beach abreast of our boat, as well as on the reef and even in the water : it was observed that they were all pretty brown in colour, and there were two or three among them of more than ordinary stature. All were naked except for a whitey-grey breech-clout with which they had their parts covered.\nTheir hair was bristly and cut short at the neck, and in their hands they carried a long white club with a knob at one end; while, besides this long one, some of them held in the other hand another shorter one, about a vara in length, of some dark coloured or black wood. They set up a great yelling and made various signs by which we under- stood quite well that they meant defiance, and that they had no fear (though we could not be sure of this). They had neither women nor old men among them.\nThe entire island consists of a strip of low-lying land surrounding a lagoon within it which covers more surface than the whole of the land does; and on this we sawtwo canoes, one of them with two Indians and the other with six. The land is clothed all over with greenery, mostly scrub, and in parts there are some trees with medium-sized trunks and spreading branches. Coco-nut palms are the most numerous, and one may suppose that they get their breech-clouts from these, as well as the chief part of their sustenance; supplemented only by fish, of which there should be good store in the lagoon. The land is so low and flat that, when a short distance off, only the palms are to be seen, and these look as if growing out of the sea. By their antics, yells, and wonderment, one may believe that they have never seen any ship before.\nNo harbour was made out at any part of the island. It is situated, according to our observations and reckoning, in lat. 17° 20' S. and long. 240° 28' from the meridian of Tenerife! Our compass showed 8° 21' of Variation N.Ely.\nIt extends approximately three miles N. and S. and four E. and W.: in circumference ten miles. It is 1145 leagues distant from the Port of El Callao. The name of San Simón y Judas was given to it. Its examination being completed and a plan drawn of it as well as could be done from bearings, we delayed no longer, since this was not the island contemplated in our commission; and we pursued our course with the wind aft, moderate, from the E. and E.S.E.",

    "Description":"On the morning of the 31st of the same month of October we dis covered another island, which, from a distance, appeared like only a palm clump of the same kind as the former one ; and, as the wind was fresh and fair, it gave us an opportunity of coasting almost all round it in the Frigate, under short canvas and at a very little distance off, to reconnoitre for an anchorage while taking bearings as its extremities and outline came into view. It is low-lying land like the other ; and covered all over with brushwood, small trees and palms. It has a large lagoon within, occupying its centre, oval in outline like its circumference: we saw a canoe upon it towards the N.W. side.\n \n The natives made big smokes, and about 12 or 14 Indians were seen, apparently of the same type as those of the other isle of San Simón, with their long pikes in their hands, breech-clouts, and one amongst them who looked like a woman leading a small child by the hand. They made signs to us as if desirous that we should land, which we did not attempt to do, because it was clearly impossible, owing to the beach being everywhere beset with reefs and rocks on which there was a heavy breaking sea, and over which the water enters and leaves the lagoon-from which I conclude there is no channel into it. There are but few inhabitants in all the island. Those we saw appeared to be peaceably disposed, for of the small number who followed along the beach after the Frigate all were not armed with spears or long pikes; and their having women and children with them, and making signs for us to go in to where they were, makes one think this.\n \n It is situated, according to us, in lat. 17° 25' S. and long. 238° 40'. Our compass showed 8° 20' of Variation N.Ely as before. It extends six and a half miles S.E. and N.W., and three and a half N.E. and S.W., with a circumference of sixteen miles.

    "Description":"In the forenoon of the 9th of October we discovered another island of the same kind as the others, though larger.\nWe came near to it later and the boat went away to examine the E. and E.N.E. part of it, but found no place where a landing was practicable. She stayed but a few hours, however, as she was recalled from on board to bear a hand in towing the Frigate round the S.E. point of a bight in which she had got embayed very close in to the shore, through the wind having died down almost to a calm. We succeeded in working her clear of the land and the boat afterwards went in again to coast along and explore the S. and S.W. sides as far as to the N.W., taking soundings and noting down its points, bays, and lagoons, while we followed her at a moderate distance, N.W. But she neither found any appearance of bottom nor any place where the Frigate might let go an anchor : nor were they able to approach the beach anywhere without boat and crew becoming exposed to great risk (which our business did not warrant). Seeing then that the shore line from the N.W. round towards the N. was even more exposed and that the surf was breaking much more heavily along it, and that it was moreover begirt with reefs without a span's length of sandy beach anywhere', the boat was signalled to come away. \nSome 20 Indians of all ages and sexes were counted on the beach in the forenoon, whose build, clothing and weapons were the same as those of the other islands : there are some pretty blonde in hue, others of a tawny colour with frizzly hair, and others again with purely Indian features and the hair lank. The women were draped from the waist to their knees with the same material as the men's breech-clouts; and figured with blue on the shoulders, the entire buttocks, trunk, arms, and legs, in various patterns and stripes. In the afternoon also a great many collected when the boat approached, and as fast as she drew ahead some of them dropped behind, while fresh ones came out from their villages to replace them. Two of them were wearing strings of shells round their necks, and a woman was seen fishing in the lagoon with her net. \nThis island is larger than the others, but it, too, consists of very low-lying land surrounded by a reef which makes the islets that shut in the lagoon on its western side communicate with each other. These islets are also in- habited, and the whole island appears to teem with people, of whom the greater number are on the E. side. The soil is very fertile, for it is all covered with greenery and full of trees, especially coco-nut palms. Their dwellings are huts thatched with palm leaves, dotted about amidst the groves of palms. No doubt, by the signs they made, they are peaceably disposed ; although these too were almost all armed with very long spears or pikes, without knobs but having very sharp points\". \nThis island is situated in lat. 17° 55' S. and long. 236° 55'. Our compass showed 8° 15' of variation Nly. It extends twenty miles S.E. and N.W., and nine S.W. and N.E. Its circumference may be forty-nine miles; and it bears E. and W. 17° 30' Southerly with that of San Quintín, distant 32 leagues, and from El Callao 1214. It was allotted the name of Todos Santos'.",

    "Description":"In fact on the morning of the 16th of November at ten o'clock we sighted high land in the W.S.W. and made every endeavour to get near to it while daylight lasted.\nSeeing, as we approached, that it was no more than a high peak, the Comandante decided to reconnoitre it that same afternoon; and, being a moderate distance off by four o'clock, the boat went away to examine it, with the same precautions as usual (notwithstanding it was thought to be uninhabited).\nWhile the boat was still a good way off we saw number of people on the N.E. side clothed in white, and two canoes with two nude Indians in each. One of these came towards us and presently.. ... to suit her. She arrived in fact at a quarter after five, with her two Indians, who brought coco-nuts, which they at once handed up (the side) and gave in exchange for some trifle.\nWhat they asked for was in their language Curi, which we afterwards understood to be their name for nails or any other bits of iron? They would not come on board, nor accept anything after they had got through all their stock of coco-nuts for barter, in spite of our pressing invitations and coaxing; and as it was now late they took themselves off, making signs to us that they would return at sunrise.\nThe two Indians, though somewhat timorous, nevertheless showed themselves very affable, vivacious and intelligent.\nIn appearance they are well favoured, of good stature, fairly light in hue, being merely browned by the sun, and some- what tawny about their features and hair, which is crinkly and sticks up in an even mass all over. They had only breech-clouts on, the buttocks and hands being figured with a pigment between lead-colour and blue; and they were without weapons ofThe boat went on with her exploration round the island, and brought up with the grapnel at a spot on the W. side, between two rocks, where some of our people landed; but the warp having parted, and it being already late, they withdrew.\nIn the early morning as many as eight canoes with two or three Indians in each having managed to get quite close to the ship by daybreak, all bent on the same traffic as the previous afternoon's, many of them ventured on board, clambering up the side with great agility; and seeming very happy, taking notice of everything, but not showing much wonder.\nAt half-past eight our boat returned to the shore (and with her all the canoes) for the purpose of taking soundings and ascertaining whether it might be possible to anchor with the Frigate, both for our better satisfaction and to fill some water. One party of our men landed by means of the Indians' canoes at the same spot where they had done so the afternoon before, while the other party proceeded all round the island in the boat, taking soundings, and sketching a plan of it as they went. They found, however, no anchorage, whether for the Frigate or for the boat; nor, again, any place adapted for easily watering ship.\nBut they saw some twenty Indians or so of all ages and sexes, who comprised apparently all that were in the island.\nAccompanied and guided by a large number of these our men struck inland for something like a mile along a beaten path, and beyond that they had to clamber up by holding on to the roots of trees that stuck out from rifts in the rocks. They saw two clusters of huts, one of five and the other of seven huts, constructed of palm leaves, the poles of which they are framed being very neatly fitted together. Their greatest height is 3.5 varas, length from 8 to 10, and width 4.5 to 5.5: they are closed in only overhead. We found the jawbone of a corpse hanging up in one hut. Their furniture and chattels consist of little baskets and mats made of palm leaves and rushes; and in some cases a small wooden stool, very skilfully carved all out of one block and having its seat concave! In another there was a puppy of medium size, black and tan, with ears pointed and erect. In others they came across some pens containing pigs as large and as fat as those of Perú, and farther on a stone enclosure of 20 or 25 varas, decorated round about with posts carved as if with characters, which the Indians would not approach ; for, by the look of it, it is their burial place', which they hold in great respect.\nThey keep their fire below ground”, covered over with black porous stones' which lie strewn about the entire path and a good part of the hill. The whole of this latter is verdant and pleasing to the view ; but on the S.E and S.W. sides the soil is very fertile, and there the natives have their plantations of yams, plantains, coco-nut palms and other trees, some of which bear a sort of pine-cone of which they merely chew the segments at their insertion“, and others a fruit of the size and shape of an ordinary chirimoya, which, when cooked, is somewhat insipid but not ill tasted\". There are three different kinds of plantains, one of which is noteworthy for its size, for each fruit is nearly three inches in diameter and a cuartas in length: they eat these roasted. They make a sort of mash of these fruits with which they keep themselves sleek and lusty.\nBiscuits and salt pork are the only eatables of ours that they care for. In addition to the breech-clout, the men have some ponchos of finely made matting, and the women certain white drapery that they get from the bark of a tree after much beating out and working up. They clothe themselves with these from the waist downwards, and many of them over the whole figure.\nThe carpenter, also, went exploring ; but did not find anything particular in the way of timbers. They do all their wood-working with their stone hatchets and adzes, after the manner of our iron ones. They were shown howto plant and sow, and seeds of all the kinds we had on board were given to them.\nNeither minerals, nor aromatic plants, nor any spice tree, were observed. They have plenty of water of good quality ; but in a very inaccessible situation.\nNor was any image of importance noticed amongst them, nor did it appear that they render worship or adoration either to any animate thing or imaginary being.\nAs our people were coming away an old man presented a pig to the officer, without expecting anything in exchange ; and after bestowing ample rewards or gratuities on them, our men embarked, and with them three Indians all in very happy mood, while some canoes followed after the boat.\nOn seeing that she was being hoisted in and that we were going farther away, and already leaving them astern, two of the Indians departed : and we were only able to retain one, who came along quite unconcernedly. We heard him, and others too, several times mention “OTAHEYTE,” the name of the island the Instructions directed us to investigate, at the same time pointing to the W.\nIt is situated in lat. 17° 50' S. and long. 234° 55'. Our compass showed 70 of Variation N.Ely. It extends one mile and a third N. and S., E. and W. one; circumference four and a half miles. With the island of Todos Santos it bears E. and W. 3° Nly, distant 43 leagues; and from El Callao 1257.\nThe name of Cerro de San Cristóbal was given to this island, and the Indians call it Omayto.",

    "PlaceName":"Isla de Amat",
    "PlaceNameModern":"Tahiti",
    "NameOfTraveler":"Raimundo Bonacorsi",
    "YearOfTravel":1772,
    "Description":"The name ISLA DE AMAT was given to this island.\nIt extends N.N.W. and S.S.E. nine leagues, W.N.W. and E.S.E. thirteen and a half leagues, circumference from forty to forty-five leagues; and lies sixteen leagues distant from the small island of San Cristobal, and 1274 from El Callao. In figure it is like two islands united by a tongue of land two leagues in width which forms two lovely bays on its N.E. and S.E.' sides respectively; and the whole is encircled by a reef of rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, some three to as much as six cables distant from the main shore. Within this the sea is absolutely smooth. There are only two short stretches off the N. and S. extremities [of the island] where there is no reef and the coast is exposed. For entering through the reef and reaching the land there are several breaks with channels of ample depth which expand inside into roadsteads or regular harbours as the plan shows; although it is to be noted that only the one where we lay at anchor in the Frigate (called after Santa Maria Magdalena) on the S.E. side, in the district of Sallalara’, is at present properly surveyed and has had any exact plan made of it. Time did not permit of so detailed an examination of the others; and one ought to be very careful in entering or leaving by them all, their mouths being skirted by low reefs which are not noticed save at very short range, besides which the wind is apt to die away in the entrance, and in such case any vessel may become endangered by the tides and currents. For these reasons it is necessary to try to pass in with a good steady breeze, in the morning and on the flood tide, for the ebb is much stronger and lasts (at any rate at the surface) a longer time. In the harbour of Santa Maria Magdalena during the full and change [of the moon] high water occurs at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the rise is only from one to one and a half fathoms.\nThere are rocky patches dotted about over the bottom, too, which cause much injury to one's cables. Most of the country-side is mountainous and rugged, and only on the N.W. and S.W. sides are there any level tracts and gently sloping valleys, besides the strip of land formed by the large bays on its N.E. and S.W. Never- theless it consists of black soil throughout, very fertile and well wooded,-strewn, indeed, with some loose stones, but covered everywhere with wild herbage, trees of various kinds and sizes, brushwood and thorns, which form, in places, dense and impenetrable thickets. Water is very plentiful, for permanent streams pour down most of the ravines and unite at the skirts of the hills to form middling- sized brooks and rivers. Most of the cultivation is to be found in the valleys and flats which extend from the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach, for it is here only that the natives reside ; and, in places, these are only two or three cables or even less, in width. Only the district of Payala is fairly broad. Palms with many coco-nuts are in the greatest abundance, for the entire island is fringed with these trees which, from a little distance off, afford a most beautiful prospect. There are five kinds of plantains: two of them especially noteworthy, the one for its size, and the other for its fine flavour; the latter being something like those they call “de la tierra\" at Lima. They have plenty of yams, of which they plant quantities, and these serve them, together with the other fruits I have mentioned in the description of Mount San Cristobal, for preparing certain puddings and mashes that they partially bake, and after- wards eat cold: and which are very nourishing for them. There are also other fruits that they do not cultivate, some having the taste of a chestnut, others of a walnut, others of an apple; but they are not like those of Europe as to their form, nor as to the trees (they grow on), and are generally all of the poorest flavour to our palates. The few red sweet potatoes they also possess are exceedingly well-tasted. There is a root resembling ginger, and there are some white flowers like daisies, with a very nice scent: others in the likeness of poppies, which are also very pretty to look at, but the rest are commonplace”. Those who fare best are the Caciques and headmen, for they possess pigs of fair size, and also fowls; because (although we saw none) those who went round the island in the launch heard hens and cocks crow on two mornings, and they (the Chiefs] told us so too. Thus it is that the arii or Caciques are all stout, some of them to ungainliness, so that they have two Indians constantly kneading their legs and even then are scarcely able to stand upright.\nThe common people frequently suffer a dearth of food, and most of them support themselves on cockles, and some fish which they eat raw. The good and finer fish, of which there is great plenty in the sea, are (reserved) for the arii and principal persons. The men eat apart from the women, and they tuck such quantities into their mouths that they can scarcely chew: so that these all become regular little baker's ovens. There are dogs of several breeds: some quite small, and others very large and hairy. Mice in plenty and very tame. Of special birds only blue parroquets with red bill and feet; but there are parrots, wood-pigeons and many other common birds. In the space of two leagues for which [our people) were able to penetrate into the interior in the neighbourhood of the harbour, though they did so with much labour on account of the rugged nature of the hillsides and denseness of the forest, a few good timbers were noted; some like a kind of lignum vitae, others resembling the yellow guaiacum, others seemingly adapted for yards and topmasts, others for knees and various requirements in shipbuilding, and yet others apparently serviceable, but of which no proper opinion could be formed because we were unacquainted with their lasting qualities and grain.

Nearly one-fifth of the population of Argentina is to be found condensed in Buenos Aires, and much of it is urgently wanted elsewhere. It has survived all the vicissitudes of early colonization, and lived to complete in another half its destiny as the most magnificent and \"up to date\" of all the cities of South America. It is not a new growth, an upstart, liek many of the mushroom cities of North America. It possesses a history and the respectability which belongs of right to a town owning stirring traditions lasting through centuries. As a town, it belongs to a fine old worl aristocracy, and the same air which pervades Rio de Janeiro is perceptible in Buenos Aires, undestroyed, uncontaminated even, by the busy chaos of telephone wires, electric tram constructions, and other accessories of modern civilization which enclose it as an iron network.",

Since the dignified old Emperor Pedro stepped down from his throne to make way for the republic, Brazil has retrograded step by step. This is frankly admitted by Brazilians themselves, although they would not have the Empire back with magmficent possessions of as vet undeveloped natural resources, and a rich heritage of splendid possibilities, the material prosperity, the credit, and the respectability of Brazil has rather diminished than increased. Some of these national assests departed with the Empire, and Rio de Janeiro bears witness to a general downward tendency. It is written largely and plainly all over its dilapitated palaces and evil-smelling boulevards.",

It is here that one meets all the most effective dandies and the best-dressed women of the town, and the beauty of the gardens whitch stretch away on either side of the road, the attractions of the racecourse, and of certain sporting accessories, are quite sufficient to justify the popularity of this society migration.

There would be no inhabitants but for Buenos Aires.

    "Description":"Into the Tigre there flows a broad, flat stream called Las Palmas (or Lujan) which runs more or less parallel to the Parana, leaving a wide space of rich delta between them, intersected by a network or innumerable minor channels and waterways. Here on a Sunday morning a great part of Buenos Aires society loses itself. There are yacht clubs and rowing clubs, and every species of waterside amusement at the end of the 21 mile run by rail from the city, and there is enough space in the woods and gardens of the delta to absorb the whole pleasure-loving population of the city. Within memory of living people this delta was covered by forest and undergrowth thick enough to contain the lairs of the spotted jaguar of South America, which has left its name to the river but is no more to be found in its neighborhood. This is the fruit-growing suburb of the town. Miles upon miles of peach trees, mixed with figs and other fruit, extend in lines along the banks of the streams and canals, well-tended and cared for, and teh amount of fruit that is thrown upon the market from the delta country must be often in excess of the demand, even in this fruit-eating centre. The surface of the river is occasionally covered with the floating debris of the market gardens. A curious population has sprung up in the delta, which, I am told, is an admixture of Basque, Spaniard, and Italian, speaking Spanish and living an easy, indolent life in a sort of Eden which requires but little delving. They are a cheery, good-looking people, bright, intelligent, and contented, taking no great interest in politics, and indifferent to the revolutionary agitaions which occasionally rage around them. The richness of the delta alluvium extends to the districts which border it. It is on Las Palmas that the most productive grazing land in Buenos Aires providence is to be found. It is here that it is possible to put sixty sheep to an acre of grass (one hardly likes to write it down!), and these sixty sheep will live on that same acre all the year round. Cattle raising and agriculture are the backbones of the Argentine industry; the future of the country mostly depends on them.\n\n[Author describes in great detail horse breeding, cattle breeding, and sheep farming]",

Something of the Old World custom of separating women from men in large assemblies seems still to prevail in South America. At any rate I observed that the women love to place themselves in artistic rows (there is, by the way, one gallery reserved for women only), and admit of no ugly black and white blotches of male attire to interfere with the harmony of their perfect colour arrangements. It almost appears as if each individual unit dressed with a view to the effect of the whole company. And the total effect is brilliant, harmonious, and infinitely delicate and pleasing in colour expression. The opera itself is excellent ; no expense is spared by a music-loving people to obtain the best artists in the world. But that is a detail. No one goes to the Buenos Aires opera merely to listen to the music.",

Twenty kilometres (about 12 1/2 miles) from the junction are the famous falls of Iguazu, which may well be called phenomenal not only for the great beauty of their surroundings, but for their magnitude. More than a mile in width, and with a fall of over 200 feet, the whole volume of the river thunders down in a double cascade, sending up thick clouds of spray amidst the dense vegetation of a sub-tropical forest. The attraction of such scenery will tend rapidly to the development of the Misiones territory. Already the great landscape gardener of Buenos Aires, M. Thays, has taken the approaches to the falls in hand. A road of twelve or thirteen miles has been cut through the virgin forest, and every point of view which can give new interest to this magnificent spectacle will be made available. It will not be long before the great falls of South America will be as much of a world's show as those of the North.",

Mendoza is not the Mendoza of Spanish foundation in 1561. That lasted 300 years, and was completely destroyed by earthquake in 1861. [...] The present Mendoza is new, and looks it. the streets appear unfinished and teh houses stand in irregular and uneven rows on either side of them. the long avenue of the central boulevard has none of the grace of mature age, and the by-ways are but incomplete and muddy tracks, leading ti unknown surroundings.\n\nThe \"Bodegas,\" or wine making establishments of Mendoza, are its most attractive feature. A short drive from the station took us to one or two of the principal bodegas, which appear to carry on a large and successful trade in the peculiar wine of the country. It is a rough produce, and it never travels far. [...] There was one feature in the vineyards, noticeable by reason of its peculiarity. In the centre of each large field, an instrument which looked like a huge funnel or blunderbuss, was set up endways with its wide mouth pointing to the sky. It was, indeed, a blunderbuss of a special pattern, adapted for firing blank charges at thunderclouds in order to avert the plague of hail. Hail works destruction in vineyards all the world over; but it appears to be only in Italy and at Mendoza that this system of precipitating rain (and thus forestalling hail) is adopted.",

As the four batteries filed along teh boulevard under the chequered shadow of the trees they looked smart and servicable, well equipped, and well found both in men and mules. The men were distinctly above the average Argentine in physique, and some of teh mules were splendid animals. they form a new feature in the Argentine service, and it is certainly remarkable how soon both men and animals have been trained into all the outward appearance of smartness. [...] The uniform of light blue and white was perhaps a litte gay for artillery, but it was most effective for parade purposes. The batteries were brought into action just under the hills outside Mendoza. there was no hitch in the proceedings such as might have been expected with recruits so recently trained to the role of gunners, and the shooting appeared to be straight and effective. It would almost seem as if gunners, equally with cavalry, are \"born, not made,\" in Argentina.\n\nNaturally one expected to hear from the military officials of Argentina some expression of dissapointment at the prospect of peace after such elaborate and expensive preporations for war had been completed ; and undoubtedly the disappointment existed, but it was unexpressed. There was throughout the service a spirit of self-contained reserve in speaking of the chances of war which impressed me greatly.",

    "Description":"From Mendoza there starts a metre-gauge railway (the trans-Andine) up the barren valleys which lead to the Uspallata pass. Over the rising slopes which border the foothills, between stony unprofitable shelves of detritus and a scanty scrub of salt bush and acacia (growing scantier with the rise of the country), the rail runs easily. It might be a tract in the Baluch lowlands, or in the South African Karoo that we pass over-but for the frequent cactus. As we rise higher the hills grow to greatness, the landscape becomes variegated in colour, marbled on the hill-side with splashes of pink where the granite outcrop occurs, and powdery white about the lower slopes. But the prevailing tint is red. Bush there is little or none, but the feathery pampas grass fits itself into cracks and clefts, advertising its existence with waving plumes ; Farther up the line, where it twists in and out of frequent gullies, and breaks into ladder-rail to lift it over steeper grades, the walls of the valley approach each other. The river, smaller and swifter, and no longer meandering from side to side of the flat bottom of a slabsided canon, becomes white with the milky outflow of the glacier, and the stone-strewn sides of the slopes above it stand at steep angles. Now and then a perfect fan, smoothed and rounded, radiates out from a crack in the mountains, and down its steepest slope (just where the water-parting should be) is cut the water-course, defying all ordinary problems of gravitation and offering despair to the topographer. On the whole, I must confess to disappointment with my first view of the Andes. I did not expect Himalayan scenery, but I did expect something of the softer charm which radiates everlastingly from the pine-clad summits of the European Alps.",

    "Description":"In March, 1902, the Argentine section of the trans-Andine line ended abruptly at Puente del Inca (the Inca's bridge), where a remarkable natural bridge spans the river, and which is necessarily (in this country) attributed to the Incas. [...] However, the bridge of Puente del Inca has nothing really to do with the Incas. It is a curious natural feature that few people take the trouble to go and see. There is a very fairly comfortable hotel here, but the place and the hotel have already be left behind by the railway, which now reaches to Las Cuevas, just under the smooth slopes which entail the final struggle to the windy summit of the pass. When we passed that way in 1902, a night at the hotel and a drive in the very early hours of the morning was a necessity of the situation. The early drive was cold, and the party packed into the wagonette (drawn by four mules abreast) was too cold to be interested in the surroundings. The sky was clear and the stars intensely brilliant . At Las Cuevas (the present terminus) a change of animals was necessary, and the rest of the drive was but a weary drag up a dusty series of zigzags to the summit, nearly 12,000 feet above sea level.",

That drive to the roadside station of the narrow gaugue line was delightful: a broad, flat, white road, with easy grades; a gradual descent through flying clouds of dust to the sweet valley of the Aconcagua; a gentle change from the snow-patched crags of the summit and the stone-strewed slopes of the landslips below, to a tangle of wild green things admist which the tall fat spikes of a red-haired cactus stood up stiffly and strangely. It was all impressive, because it was so new, and so unlike anything that I had seen before. There was a certain familiarity about a rope bridge, across (or along) which an old woman was hauling herself slowly as she sat in the pendent wire loop. It was barbaric and hardly expected; and the galloping horses, driven in a circle over the wheat spread beneath them to be threshed, was another quaint glimpse of mediæval methods surviving in the modern world.",

Plantations have been formed near Talcahuano. There is, nevertheless, quite a large variety of useful timber from the southern forest already in the wood market, and so much demand has already been made on the best and most useful classes of wood, that large areas near the coast (notably, near Puerto Montt) have been denuded of much magnificent timber without any attempt at replacing it by plantation, or hope of preserving it by any system of conservancy. It was a reckless disregard of all ordinary laws of forestry which permitted the destruction of teh splendid growth of the alerce (Fitzroya Patagonica) near Puerto Montt. The ragged and weather-worn stumps which remain are witnesses to the splendid size of the trees and the ruthless nature of their destruction. there is not a good tree left. Fortunately, the best timber is at present found in positions more remote from the coast. Alerce and cypress are valuable whenever they are found, and it may happen that with the growth of the means of access to the upper valleys of teh Andes, where they chiefly exist at present, will come a growth of appreciation of the necessity for forest reservations, and forest nurseries.",

    "Description":"From the harbour of Talcahuano it is a very short run by rail to the lovely old town of Concepcion. The Intendente, or Governor, of the town rightly judged that the best he could offer to the stranger was a view of Concepcion from the hills above; so, after disposing of the inevitable reception (and the invariable but trying ordeal by champagne), we rode out of the quaint old plaza, across the poplar avenue (more stately and yet more blessed in the grace of its surroundings than the poplar avenue of Islamabad in Kashmir) , and up the steep red slopes of the hills to where we might watch the Bio-Bio interlacing the plains (threaded with poplar and now blue with the shimmer of autumn haze), and curling itself lazily to the lip of the sea. It was a typical view of Central Chile. The town of Concepcion (square built, with straight streets intersecting) packed its white houses round the central Plaza, and extended broken arms out into the yellow plains beyond. On one side of it were the sunlit hills, red and purple, with dark blotches of broken forest; and we stood on an outlying spur of them looking a cross the town and over the river to the shining sea. Below us was the Bio-Bio bridge, which is 1,889 metres in length and was opened in the year of grace 1889- so we were told. It wore an unsubstantial look because its girders rested on trestles with no apparent abutments, or protecting piers, to break the force of what is at times an unruly river. It looked just a narrow ribbon of communication between the town and the port of Talcahuano.\n\nIn every town of Chile the banks seem to occupy the best sites and to rise to the greatest architectural magnificence. So it is in Concepcion. But the shops are good, and the Club (with eighty English members) was emphatic in its welcome and impressive in its hopes of a speedy termination to a condistion of \"armed peace\" which handicapped trade and paralysed enterprise.",

The copper smelting is accessory to the coal mining, for no copper from Chilean territory is smelted here. The ores (carbonates and sulphates) are brought down from California in ships, and here undergo a succession of refining processes.\n\nBut memories of Lota are entwined with other visions than those of roaring furnaces and vast mountains of unutilised slag. There was a garden above Lota, on the cliffs overlooking the bay, which had been laid out by a Chilean lady, who, determined to redeem the black ugliness of the coal fields from which she derived her fortune by following the suggestions of artistic fancy, devoted the declining years of her life to landscape gardening. Nothing repays the artist in Chile like the development of its natural beauty in landscape form. For miles one might wander through the lovely leafy avenues of these gardens, turning occasionally into open spaces where fountains and statues broke the chequered lights, or where masses of flowers piled themselves in banks and beds against the velvet slopes of cultured turf and never lose sight altogether of the glitter of the western sea as it faded in hazy distance to meet the sunset.",

Cold and grey and misty was the usual condition of the atmosphere, but neither greyness nor mist could much affect the weird beauty of the endless procession of th e mountain scenery through which we glided and slid [...] Forest was everywhere about us, dense, shadowy, dark, and generally dripping. The long lines of the higher sierra were thick with it up to the point where the granite cliffs, polished and smoothed by ice-cap and glacier, gave foothold to vegetation only on their flat ledges. The little islets, that seemed to chase one another through the streaky grey sea, were rounded and packed with it [...] Sometimes there would come a break in the hills. Then one looked up the long blue vista of a valley, counting fold upon fold and spur upon spur, ever growing bluer and fainter in the distance, till a gleam of white shimmering light showed where the glacier lay at the end. Sometimes another inlet twisted out of the main course, running so deep into the heart of the hills that the head of it was lost to view. But the glacier made itself felt in the cold touch of the icy air which breathed from its mouth, and in the countless little white icebergs that tumbled along one after another round the curves of the inlet shore out into the open. Although it was difficult to imagine that anything so wet and so dripping as that prirmeval forest could ever make an effective blaze, still there were unmistakeable evidences of vast forest fires at intervals.",

    "Description":"Along the immediate rim of the sea there were usually rocks and kelp and mussels and sea creatures of many sorts. Here we could climb along with difficulty; but the leaving of the hard rocks of the shore, and the thrusting of one's body into the close set jungle of undergrowth was a process much more difficult. The countless masses of growing things, and the rotten substratum of things that had done growing, made a most insecure footing. The deep spongy moss let one in knee deep even when it covered a hard rocky surface. When it merely hid a slimy mass of interlaced and rotten tree trunks there was no known depth to which one might not descend. It would be easy enough for a man to disappear bodily (as in an Irish bog) whilst still wandering under the shade of those forest trees. The result is that no living four-footed creature is to be found in Patagonian jungles near the sea; and sport, as known to the British sportsman, does not exist [...] Thick as is t h forest growth there is nothing on the islands which can be called good timber. A few \"canoe\" Indians find there home in these still waters, punting from one small bay to another, and subsisting on the mussels (choros) and sea eggs which cluster thick on the rocky edges of the land. Immense \"middens,\" or mounds of cast-away shells, testify to a far more extensive Indian occupation than now exists, and all nautical wanderers through these by-ways of the sea speak of the rapid diminuation of the ancient coast tribes.\n\n[Author continues to describe his thoughts regarding the Native Americans he encountered]",

The entrance of the harbour is narrow, but becomes wider inside, and is enclosed on every side by high hills, where there are castles and fine houses, with many fruit gardens. On the left hand there is an eminence, surmounted by a great tower, said to have been built by Roldan, for which reason it is called the tower of Roldan. Opposite this hill there is another, where the city is built, and the gate and houses facing the harbour are so close to the water, that the walls are washed by it; and two towers stand out from the walls, rising from the sea about a sling's throw from each other.\n \n When it is necessary, a chain is stretched from one tower to the other, inside which the galleys and boats take refuge, in time of war. Between the town and the tower of Roldan there is a castle with high towers, battlements, and turrets, and a wall surrounds the whole, to guard the city. Towards the sea there are high rocks, so that no vessel could enter the port in time of war; and another wall runs along the sea face, within which there is a hill covered with vineyards and olive gardens, and between this hill and the wall there is a street, with many houses and shops. \n \n The houses of Gaeta are very handsome to look at outside ; they are very high, with windows towards the sea.\n \n The finest street is that which runs parallel to the sea, the others being steep, narrow, and bad for walking. In the chief street there is much merchandise, and the city has a considerable trade during the whole year.",

It is said that there is a record in the city, showing that this opening was made on the day on which Jesus Christ suffered his passion. Within the walls there are many beautiful houses and gardens, containing oranges, lemons, citrons, and vines, which are very pleasant to look upon.

The people of this island are Greeks, and were formerly subject to the empire of Constantinople; but they are now under a Genoese named Juan de Catalus, whose father married a daughter of the emperor. They tell a strange story concerning this Genoese: that about twenty years ago, when this lord, and his father and mother and two brothers were asleep in the castle, the earth shook and threw down the castle, killing them all except this Genoese lord, who escaped in the cradle in which he slept; and was found next day in a vineyard at the foot of the castle: and it was a great wonder that he thus escaped.

    "Description":"The island of Tenia, which is opposite the said city, used to be the port of the city, to which ships resorted. It was occupied by king Priam, who built a great castle on it, called Tenedos, for the defence of the shipping. This island used to be full of inhabitants, but it is now deserted. The boat was sent from the ship to procure water and wood, and some of the attendants of the embassy went to see the island, and found many vineyards and fruit trees, and game such as partridges and rabbits, and the ruins of a great castle.\n \n The reason why this island of Tenia is uninhabited, is as follows:-About twenty-two years ago, the emperor of Constantinople promised to give the said island to the Genoese, for assisting him with some galleys in his war against the Turk; but he afterwards sold it to the Venetians, who settled on it, and fortified the town and castle. When the Genoese heard this, they declared that the island belonged to them, and that the emperor had promised it to them, and that he had no right to sell it to any one.\n \n Thus there was discord between the Genoese and Venetians, and they both began to arm their feets, and committed great slaughter amongst each other, upon this island. Peace was made on condition that neither should have it; that the town and castle should be laid in ruins, and that the island should be left uninhabited. This is one of the causes why, at this day, there is enmity between the Genoese and Venetians.\n \n On Sunday afternoon a vessel arrived in the port of Tenio, and they sent to ask where she came from. She was from Gallipoli, a place belonging to the Turk, but on Grecian land, and was bound for Chios, with a cargo of wheat; and she brought news that a great pestilence raged at Gallipoli.\n \n The ambassadors were detained for thirteen days more, owing to the foul wind ; and from the said island of Tenio they could see a very high mountain called Monteston, which is in the land of Greece, and where there is a monastery of Greek monks, who lead very holy lives, and will not allow a woman, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor any tame thing which has young, to come near them : and they do not eat meat. This monastery is very rich, and they say that it is two days journey from the foot of the mountain to the summit, where the monastery stands; and, besides this one, there are fifty or sixty monasteries, where the monks all dress in black, and do not drink wine, nor eat meat, nor oil, nor fish, with blood ; and these things were related by some Greeks who were in the said ship, who had lived some time on that holy mountain.",

They say that even now there are three thousand churches, large and small; and within the city there are fountains and wells of sweet water ; and in a part below the church which is dedicated to the Holy Apostle, there is a bridge reaching from one valley to another, over houses and gardens, by which water used to come, for the irrigation of those gardens.\n ...\n The city of Constantinople is near the sea, as you have been told, and two sides face the sea; and in front is the city of Pera. Between the two cities is the port, and Constantinople is thus like Seville, and Pera is like Triana, with the port and the ships between them; and the Greeks do no call it Constantinople as we do, but Escomboli.",

    "Description":"The first thing they went to see, was the church of St. John the Baptist, which they call St. John of the stone, and which is near the emperor's palace. On the top of the first doorway of this church there was a very rich figure of St. John, well designed in mosaic; and near this doorway there was a lofty capital, raised on four arches; and the roof and walls are covered with beautiful images and figures in mosaic. This mosaic work is made of very small stones, which are covered with fine gilt, and blue, white, green, or red enamel, according to the colour which is required to depict the figures, so that this work is very marvellous to behold. \n Beyond this place there is a great court, surrounded by houses, and containing many cypress trees: and opposite the door into the body of the church there is a beautiful fountain, under a canopy raised upon eight white marble pillars, and the pipe of the fountain is of white stone. The body of the church is very lofty, and near the entrance there are three small chapels, each containing an altar, and the door of the centre chapel is plated with silver ; and by the side of the door there are four marble columns inlaid with small jaspers, and silver crosses, and precious stones : and there are curtains of silk across these doors, placed there that the priest may not be seen when he goes in to say mass. The roof is very rich, and inlaid with mosaics. On the roof of the body of the church there is a figure of God the Father ; and the walls are inlaid in the same manner nearly to the ground; and the floor is enriched with jaspers. The chapel was surrounded by seats of carved wood, and between each chair there was a brazier with ashes, into which the people spit, that they may not spit on the ground; and there are many lamps of silver and of glass.\n \n There are many relics in this church, of which the emperor keeps the key. On this day the ambassadors were shown the left arm of St. John the Baptist, from the shoulder to the hand. This arm was withered, so that the skin and bone alone remained, and the joints of the elbow and the hand were adorned with jewels set in gold. This church also contains many relics of Jesus Christ; but the ambassadors were not shown them on that day, because the emperor had gone out hunting, and had left the keys of the church with the empress, but he forgot to give her the keys of the place where these relics were kept. But on another day they were shown, as will presently be related. This church belongs to a monastery, and the monks have a very large hall, in the middle of which there is a table of white marble, thirty paces long, and there are many wooden seats round it; and there are three other small tables. Within the precincts of this monastery there are gardens, and vineyards, and other things which there is not space to describe.",

    "Description":"The same day they went to see another church called Peribelico, dedicated to St. Mary. At the entrance to this church there is a great court, containing many cypresses, walnut trees, elms, and other trees. The outer walls of the church are covered with images and other figures, in gold, blue, and other colours. On the left hand side of the entrance to the church there are many figures, and amongst them an image of St. Mary, with one of the emperor and another of the empress on each side. At the feet of the image of St. Mary there are representations of thirty castles and cities, with the names of Grecian cities written under them. They say that these cities and castles formerly belonged to this church, having been given by an emperor called Romanus, who lies interred here. At the feet of the image there were certain documents written in steel, and sealed with seals of wax and lead, which described the privileges enjoyed by this church over those cities and castles.\n \n There are five altars in the body of the church; which is very large and lofty, supported on pillars of various coloured marble, and the walls and floor are inlaid with jasper; and the ceiling is inlaid with very rich mosaics. On the left hand side, at the end of the church, there is a handsome stone monument, where the body of the emperor Romanus is interred: they said that this monument was formerly covered with gold and precious stones, but that when the Latins captured this city, ninety years ago, they plundered this tomb.\n \n In this church there is another great stone tomb, in which another emperor is interred, and this church also contains the other arm of the blessed St. John the Baptist, which was shown to the ambassadors. This was the right arm, and it was fresh and healthy ; and, though they say that the whole body of the blessed St. John was destroyed, except one finger of the right arm, with which he pointed when he said “ Ecce Agnus Dei,” yet certainly the whole of this arm was fresh and in good preservation, but it wanted the thumb. [There is another paragraph about the thumb involving a dragon.]\n In this same church they were shown a small cross, a palmo in length, ornamented with gold, with a small crucifix and it was placed in a recess which was covered with gold, so that it could be taken out and replaced at pleasure. They say that it is made of the wood of the true cross, on which our Lord Jesus Christ was placed, and its colour is black.\n \n Outside the church there is a cloister, where there are many beautiful representations of history, among which is the root of Jesse, showing the lineage whence came the blessed Virgin Mary. It was figured in mosaic; and was so wonderful, so rich, and so well drawn, that it surpassed all the other works. There are many monks belonging to the church, who showed the above things to the ambassadors and also took them into a very large and lofty refectory, in the midst of which there was a table of white marble, very well made, being thirty-five palmos long, and the floor was of marble flags. At the end of this refectory there were two small tables of white marble, and the ceiling was covered with mosaic work; and on the walls pictures were represented in mosaic work, from the salutation of the blessed Virgin Mary by St. Gabriel, to the birth of Jesus Christ our God, together with his journeys with his disciples, and all his blessed life, until he was crucified. In this refectory there were many flag stones, made to place meat and other food upon ; and in the monastery there were many cells, where the monks live ; and gardens, and water, and vineyards, so that this monastery is like a large town.",

    "Description":"On another day the ambassadors went to see a plain called the Hippodrome, where they joust. It is surrounded by white marble pillars, so large that three men can only just span round them, and their height is two lances. They are thirty-seven in number, fixed in very large white marble bases ; and above, they were connected by arches going from one to the other, so that a man can walk all round, on the top of them; and there are battlements, breast high, of white marble, and these are made for ladies, and maidens, and noble women, when they view the jousts and tournaments which are celebrated here. In front of these seats, there is a row of pillars, on which is a high seat, raised on four marble pillars, surrounded by other seats, and at each corner there are four images of white marble, the size of a man; and the emperor is accustomed to sit here, when he views the tournaments. Near these pillars, there are two blocks of white marble, one on the top of the other, of great size, each one being the height of a lance, or more; and on the top of these blocks there are four square blocks of copper.\n \n On the top of these blocks there is an immense stone, sharp at the end, at least six lances in height. It is not fixed in any way; so that it was marvellous to think how so great a mass of stone, yet so sharp and fine, could have been placed there. It is so high that it may be seen above the city, from the sea. This column has been placed there in memory of some great event; and on the base there is an inscription, announcing who it was who caused this stone to be placed there, and for what reason ; but as the writing was in Greek, and it was getting late, the ambassadors could not wait to have it read to them. But they say that it was raised to commemorate some great deed. Beyond it the range of columns continues, though they are not so high as the first, and the deeds of the knights are painted on them ; and between these columns there are three copper figures of serpents. They are twisted like a rope, and they have three heads, with open mouths. It is said that these figures of serpents were put here, on account of an enchantment which was effected. The city used to be infested by many serpents, and other evil animals, which killed and poisoned men ; but an emperor performed an enchantment over these figures, and serpents have never done any harm to the people of the city, since that time.\n \n The plain is very large, and is surrounded by steps, one rising above the other to a considerable height; and these steps are made for the people of the city; and below them there are great houses, with doors opening on the plain, where the knights who are going to joust are accustomed to arm and disarm.",

    "Description":"On the same day the ambassadors went to see the church which is called St. Sophia, which is the largest, most honoured, and most privileged of all the churches in the city; and it has canons who do duty as if it was a cathedral, and a patriarch, whom the Greeks call Marpollit.\n \n In a court, in front of the church, there are nine very large white marble pillars, the largest I ever beheld, and it is said that a great palace used to stand on the top of them, where the patriarch and his clergy held their meetings. In this same court, in front of the church, a wonderfully high stone column stands, on the top of which there is a horse made of copper, of the size of four large horses put together; and on its back there is the figure of an armed knight, also of copper, with a great plume on his head, resembling the tail of a peacock. The horse has chains of iron round its body, secured to the column, to prevent it from falling, or being moved by the wind. This horse is very well made, and one fore and one hind leg is raised, as if it was in the act of prancing. The knight, The knight, on its back, has his right arm raised, with the hand open, while the reins are held with the left This column, horse, and knight, are so large and high, that it is wonderful to see them. This marvellous horse is said to have been placed here by the Emperor Justinian, who erected the column, and performed great and notable deeds against the Turks, in his time.\n \n At the entrance to this church, under an arch, there is a small but very rich and beautiful chapel, raised upon four marble columns; and opposite this chapel is the door of the church. It is very large and high, and covered with brass, and in front of it there is a small court, containing some high terraces ; beyond which there is another door covered with brass, like the first. Within this door there is a broad and lofty nave, with a ceiling of wood, and on the left hand there are very large and well built cloisters, adorned with slabs of marble and jasper of various colours. The body of are of the church contains five lofty doors, all covered with brass, and the centre one is the largest. The body of the church is the loftiest, most rich, and most beautiful that can be seen in the whole world. It is surrounded by three large and broad naves, which are joined to it, so that mass may be heard in all parts of the church. The arches of the naves green jasper, and unite the roofs of the nave with that of the body of the church; but the summit of the latter rises much higher than that of the naves. It is dome shaped, and very high, so that a man must have good eyes who looks up from beneath ; and the church is one hundred and five paces long, by ninety-three broad; and the dome is supported by four pillars, very large and thick, covered with flags of many coloured jaspers ; and from pillar to pillar there are arches of green jasper, which are very high and sustain the dome. In the arches there are four very large slabs, two on the right hand and two on the left, which are coloured with a substance made from a powder, artificially, and called porphyry. The dome is covered with very rich mosaic work, and, over the high altar, the image of God the Father, very large, is wrought in mosaics of many colours; but it is so high up, that it only looks about the size of a man, or a little larger, though really it is so large that it measures three palmos between the eyes; but to him who looks at it, it does not appear to be more nor less than a man, and that is owing to the very great height it is placed above the ground.\n \n On the floor, in the centre of the part under the dome, there is a pulpit placed on four columns of jasper ; and the sides of it are covered with flags of jasper ; and this pulpit is surmounted by a capital, raised on eight very large jasper columns; and here they preach, and also say the gospel on feast days. The walls and floor of the church are lined with flags of jasper, worked all over with ornaments, very beautiful to behold. The part between the arches, which supports the dome, was of very handsome white stone, on which many appropriate figures were inlaid, and above that there was very rich mosaic. The arched roofs of the naves surrounded the dome, except where the high altar stood, all which was worth seeing. The said arched roofs were ninety paces broad, and four hundred and ten paces round, and they were beautifully inlaid with mosaics. In the wall, on the left hand side, there is a very large white slab, on which, among many other figures, was drawn, very naturally, without any human artifice of sculpture or painting, the most sacred and blessed Virgin Mary, with our Lord Jesus Christ in her most holy arms, with his most glorious forerunner, St. John the Baptist, on one side. These images, as I said before, are not drawn, or painted with any colour, or inlaid ; but the stone itself gave birth to this picture, with its veins, which may be clearly seen ; and they say that when this stone was cut, to be placed in this most holy place, the workmen saw these most wonderful and fortunate images on it, and, as this church was the most important one in the city, that stone was deposited in it. The said images appear as if they were in the clouds of heaven, and as if there was a thin veil before them.\n \n This appeared most wonderful, as a thing which God himself had shown; and at the foot of these images there is an altar, and a small chapel, in which they say mass ; and in this church was shown the holy body of a patriarch, which was entire, both in bone and flesh.\n \n The ambassadors were also shown the gridiron on which the blessed St. Lawrence was roasted; and in the church of St. Sophia there are vaults and cisterns, and subterranean chambers, which are strange things, wonderful to see. Near the church there are many fallen edifices, and doors leading to the church, closed and ruined. In the church there is a very large cistern under ground, capable of floating ten galleys. All these works, and many others in this church, were shown, so that they can neither be related nor written briefly; and so great is the edifice, and the wonderful works in the church are so numerous, that they take a long time to see. The roofs are all covered with lead. This church is privileged, and any person, either Greek or of any other nation, who commits a crime, either of robbery or murder, and takes refuge here, may not be taken hence.",

They then mounted on horseback, and went to see a church called “ Santa Maria de la Cherne,” which is within the city, and opposite to a ruined castle, which used to be a lodging, used by the emperors. The said castle was destroyed by an emperor, because he found his son in it, in a manner that will be related to you presently.\n \n This church of Santa Maria de la Cherne\" used to be a chapel of the emperor's, and the interior consists of three naves, the centre one being the largest and most lofty, and the other two being lower. They are vaulted, and the arches connect them together. These naves are adorned in the following manner. They are raised on great pillars of green jasper, and their bases are of white marble, inlaid with many figures. The ceilings and the walls, half way up, are covered with flags of jasper of many colours, with many figures and beautiful works artificially wrought upon them.\n \n The ceiling of the centre nave is very rich, made of timber in squares and beams, all gilded with very fine gold; and though parts of the church were much out of repair, this gilded ceiling looked as fresh and as beautiful as if it was just finished. In the centre nave there was a rich altar and a pulpit, also very rich; and all the furniture of the church is very rich and costly, and the roof was all covered with lead.",

Between the city walls and the sea, opposite Pera, there are many houses, in which many things are sold, and warehouses.\n \n Pera is a small city, but well peopled and surrounded with a wall, and it contains good and handsome houses. It is inhabited by Genoese, and is a lordship of Genoa. It is peopled by Genoese and Greeks, and is so close to the sea, that between the wall and the water there is not sufficient breadth for a carrack to pass. The wall runs along the shore, and then ascends a hill, on the top of which there is a great tower, whence the city is watched. This hill, however, is not so high as another outside the town, which rises above it; and on that eminence the Turk encamped when he besieged Pera and Constantinople, and here they fought, and hurled missiles from engines. The Turk twice assaulted the city, and blockaded it by sea and land for six months, with four hundred thousand men on land, and sixty galleons and ships by sea; but they were unable to enter, nor even to occupy a suburb, so that it seems that the Turks are not good combatants, as they could not enter.",

It is surrounded by very high mountains, and many great rivers fall into it. The sea boils and rises into great waves, when the wind springs up. This sea is also dangerous because, when ships approach the strait, it is very difficult to know it, and if they miss it, they go on shore and are lost, as has happened many times; also, if when the strait is made out, and the vessel is near it, any of the gales arise, she is in danger of being driven on shore, and in this manner a vessel was lately lost which was coming from Caffa.\"",

    "Description":"The ambassadors desired to depart at once, but they could not. They, however, hired horses to carry them as far as the land of Arsinga, and men to guard them. On Friday they set out, accompanied by ten men on horseback, and at the hour of mass they came to a castle, on the top of a high rock, which also belonged to Cabasica, where they found men in the road, who took a toll from them. At noon they came to a valley where they were told that there was a castle belonging to the Turks of a lineage called Chapenies, who were at war with Cabasica, and that in the valley there was a guard, which waited for passengers. At the hour of vespers they came to a town of Arsinga, called Alangogaza, and Cabasica's ten men took leave of them. On this day the road was very mountainous ; and in this town there was a Turkish cavalier, who held the place for the lord of Arsinga.",

Many people came out from the city, to receive and to see the ambassadors, and they were conducted to the lodgings which had been prepared for them. That night the lord of the city sent them boiled and dressed meat, and much fruit, and bread, and wine.\n \n [Subsequent pages contain some interesting points about food and drink as well as hospitality.]\n \n This city of Arsinga was built on a plain, near a river which is called Euphrates,' which is one of the rivers that come from Paradise. This plain is entirely surrounded by very high mountains, and on the top of the highest of these mountains there is much snow. There are many towns, and fruit gardens in the plain, which is covered with corn fields and vineyards, and very beautiful gardens. The city was not very large, and the walls and towers which surrounded it, were built of stone. It was built by the Armenians, and the sign of the cross is cut on many parts of the walls. The houses all have terraces, and the people walk along the terraces, as if they were streets. The city is very populous, and contains many fine streets, and it is very rich, and has much trade, and many beautiful mosques and temples. It is inhabited by many christians, Greeks, and Armenians. They say that when Timour Beg took and destroyed a Turkish city called Sabastria,' that the Turk came against this city of Arsinga, and entered it; but when Timour Beg conquered the Turk, he came to this city, and took it for himself.",

This city was in a plain, and on one side flowed the great river called Corras; and on the other there was a very deep and rocky valley, as broad as the flight of an arrow; and it encircled the city, until it united with the river. The valley and river made the city very strong, so that it could only be attacked where the river commenced; but at this place there was a very strong castle, with great towers, and it had two gates, one in front of the other. This city of Calmarin was the first city that was built in the world, after the flood, and it was built by the lineage of Noah. The people of the city said that, eight years ago, Tetani, Emperor of Tartary, besieged the city, and that they fought day and night for two days, and on the third there was a parley. They gave up the city, on condition that neither he, nor his people should enter it, but that the citizens should pay to him a certain annual tribute ; with which the emperor was satisfied, but he demanded that half the people of the city should be given up to him, to go with him to the land of Jugania,' where he was going to make war on the king Sorso. When the citizens had given up these men, the emperor attacked the city, entered it by force, pillaged and burnt it, making breaches in the walls, and killing many people.\n \n The greater part of the inhabitants were Armenians ; but the land of Armenia has been taken from the Christians by the Moors, as I will relate to you, presently. In this city there are very great edifices; and throughout all this country, they gave the ambassadors and their people lodging, and food, and horses; for all the land belonged to Timour Beg.",

It was very high, and the summit was covered with snow, and it was without woods; but there was much herbage upon it, and many streams. Near the road there were many edifices, and foundations of houses, of stone; and great quantities of rye was growing, as if it had been sown by man, but it was useless, and did not come to grain ; and there was also plenty of water cresses. At the foot of this mountain they came to the ruins of a town long since deserted, which was a league in length ; and the people of the country said that it was the first town that was built in the world, after the flood, and that it was founded by Noah and his sons.\n \n After leaving these ruins, they came to a great plain, in which there were many streams of water, and trees, and rose gardens, and fountains.\n \n The mountain had a very sharp peak, which was covered with snow, and they say that the snow never leaves this peak all the year round, either in winter or summer, and this is on account of its great height.\n \n On this day the ambassadors took their siesta by a beautiful fountain, near a stone arch; and while they were there, the clouds moved away, and the peak of the mountain appeared, but they suddenly returned, and the people said that it was very seldom visible.\n \n Next to this mountain, there was another, which also had a sharp peak, but not so high as the first, and between these two peaks there is one like a saddle, and they were all very high, and their summits were all covered with snow.",

    "Description":"On Wednesday, the 11th of June, at the hour of vespers, they arrived at the great city of Tabreez. This city is in a plain, between two high ranges of hills. It is not walled, and the hills on the left hand are very near the city, and are very hot, and the water which descends from them is not wholesome ; but those on the right hand are more distant, and they are very cold and capped with snow, and the water which descends from them is very good. These streams come down to the city, and flow through it in various directions.\n \n In the range of hills, opposite the city, there are two high rocks, which used to be united, but every year they move further from each other. In the range on the left hand side there is a high hill, which, they say, was once bought by the Genoese, from a ruler whose name was Sultan Veis, for the purpose of building a castle upon it. They add, that after it was sold, he changed his mind, and, when the Genoese wished to build the castle, he sent for them, and told them that it was not the custom for merchants to build castles in his country. He said that they might take their merchandize away, and that if they wanted to build a castle, they might move the hill out of his territory. When they answered him, he ordered their heads to be cut off.\n \n From the range of hills on the right hand, a great river descends towards the city, and is divided into many channels, which flow through the streets. In this city there are many well ordered streets and lanes, where they sell many things.\n \n In some of the streets there are very large buildings, with many doors, within which are shops, and there are officers who keep order. From these buildings there are gateways leading to certain streets, where they sell many things, such as cloth, silk, cotton, tafeta, and other stuffs ; and this city has a great trade.\n \n In one place, in these buildings, there are certain men who sell many kinds of scents and pigments for women; and the women come themselves to buy them, and they paint and anoint themselves. These women go about, covered all over with a white sheet, with a net, made of black horse hair, before their eyes, and thus they are concealed, so that no one can recognize them, In this city there are many grand edifices, especially mosques, which are ornamented very skilfully with mosaics, and blue and gold work, made in Greece. They say that these great works were made by very rich men, who were jealous of each other, and each strove to erect the most wonderful work, and in this way they spent their wealth.\n \n Amongst these edifices there was a great house, which was surrounded by a wall, very beautiful and rich, in which there are twenty thousand chambers and apartments; and they say that this house was built by a ruler of Persia, named Sultan Veis; with the treasure that was paid him, as tribute, by the Sultan of Babylon. He called this house Tolbatgana, which means “ the house of fortune.” This house is well built.\n \n The city of Tabreez is very large and rich, owing to the quantity of merchandize that passes through it, every day.\n \n [Folllowing paragraphs discuss food, religion, politics, government.]",

    "Description":"On Thursday, the 22nd of June, at noon, they arrived at the great city of Sultanieh, where they found Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg. On Friday morning they went to see the said Miran Meerza; and as it is the custom for every one who goes to see him, to give him some thing, the ambassadors brought some cloth, and other things.\n \n They found him in a palace, where there was a large fruit garden, full of armed men ; and he received them very well, and invited them into a tent where he was sitting, asking them after the health of the lord our king.\n \n After they had talked for a long time, they were asked to eat, and the ambassadors ate according to their custom, and, when they wished to go away, they were given some robes to dress in.\n \n This city of Sultanieh is in a plain, and has no wall; but it has a castle with strong walls, and handsome towers, and all the towers and walls were ornamented with patterns, and each tower had a small catapult on the top.\n \n This city is very populous, but it is not so large as Tabreez, though it possesses more trade. Every year, especially in the months of June, July, and August, very large caravans of camels arrive, with great quantities of merchandize. They mean the same as we do by the word caravan, namely, a drove of beasts. This city has a great traffic, and yields a large revenue to the lord. Every year many merchants come here from India, with spices, such as cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, manna, mace, and other precious articles, which do not go to Alexandria. Also all the silk which is made in Gheelan comes here, and Gheelan is a province near the sea of Bakou, where much silk is made every year. This silk of Gheelan is sent to Damascas, and Syria, and Turkey, and many other countries. Also there arrives all the silk which is made in the province of Xamahi, and merchants come here for silk, even Venetians and Genoese.\n \n This land is so hot that when any foreign merchant is struck by the sun, he is killed; and they say that when the sun strikes any one, it presently penetrates to his heart and kills him, burning his back very much; and those who escape, almost always remain quite yellow, and never return to their proper colour.\n \n There also arrive in this city many silken cloths, cottons, tafetas, and other stuffs from a land called Shiraz, which is near India, and from Yesen, and Serpi ; and from Khorassan there come cotton threads, and cotton cloths, woven in many colours. This land of Khorassan is a great territory, which extends from Tartary to India. Many precious stones also arrive in this city of Sultanieh. From Cathay vessels come within sixty days journey of this city, having navigated the western sea, which is the sea which bounds this land; and they come to a river, which is ten days journey from the city of Ormuz. The ships and boats which navigate this sea have no iron; but their timbers are joined with cords and wooden pegs; for if they were united with iron, they would soon be torn to pieces by the loadstones, of which there are many in that sea. These ships bring many pearls, and some of them bring rubies, (which are very fine in Cathay), and much spice; and from Ormuz these things are sent to all parts of the world.\n \n Most of the pearls are found in that sea of China, and they bring them to the city of Ormuz, to be pierced and cut; and the Moorish and Christian merchants say that they know of no place where the pearls can be pierced, except this city of Ormuz. The city of Sultanieh is sixty days journey from the city of Ormuz. They also say that these pearls are formed in large shells, which they call jacares; and those who come from Cathay, and from Ormuz, say that the pearl is formed in the shells, which are large, and as white as paper. Theybring them to this city of Sultanieh, and to Tabreez, where they make girdles and rings of them.\n \n All the merchants who come from the land of the Christians, from Caffa, and Trebizond, and the merchants of Turkey and Syria, come every year, at this time, to the city of Sultanieh, to make their purchases. This city is situated in a plain, and many channels of water pass through it, and in it there are many well ordered streets, where the people sell their merchandize. In this city there are several large inns, where the merchants lodge. The city is surrounded by very extensive and populous plains ; and on the right hand there are some mountains, and beyond them is a land called Koordistan. These mountains are very wild, and there is snow upon them all the year round. On the left hand there is another range of hills, which are very hot, and behind them is the province of Gheelan, and the sea of Bakou,' which is surrounded by land, and is not connected with any other sea whatever; and it is six days journey from Sultanieh to the sea of Bakou. Diamonds are found, on some islands in the sea of Bakou. Snow never falls in the land of Gheelan, because it is so hot; and it produces many citrons, lemons, and oranges.\n \n The city of Sultanieh has a great traffic, and yields a large yearly revenue to the lord ; and this city, with Tabreez, and the empire of Persia, was formerly governed by Miran Meerza, the eldest son of Timour Beg, but he has been deprived, for the following reasons :-Miran Meerza, being the ruler of this land, had many knights with him, and a large army, which his father had given him. Being in the city of Tabreez, he ordered a great number of houses, mosques, and fine buildings to be destroyed, and many were pulled down.\n \n He then went to Sultanieh, ordered the same to be done there, took his father's treasure out of the castle, and divided it amongst his followers. Outside the city, a little apart, there was a very fine edifice, built by a great knight, who lies interred within it. Miran Meerza ordered this also to be destroyed, and the body of the great knight to be cast out. [...]\n \n [Following paragraphs provide dialog between Miran Meerza and his father, etc.]",

After they had eaten, the knight said to them that, on another day, they should go and visit a great Meerza, who was son-in-law to the lord.\n \n When the ambassadors were going to depart, he gave Ruy Gonzalez a dress, and a hat, and said that he was to accept them as a token of the friendship which Timour Beg felt for his king.\n \n This city of Teheran was very large, but it had no walls, and it was a very delightful place, well supplied with everything ; but it was an unhealthy place, according to the natives, and fevers were very prevalent. The territory in which it stands is called Rei, which is a great and extensive lordship, possessed by the son-in-law of the lord.\n \n The road from Sultanieh to Teheran is very level, and the country is populous, and very hot.",

    "Description":"On Thursday they reached a great city, on the banks of a river, and two deserted castles.\n \n On Thursday, the 17th of July, in the night, they arrived at a city which is called Damghan, situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall, with a castle at one end.\n \n This city is in the province of Media. On this day it was so hot, with a hot fierce wind, that it was quite wonderful.\n \n The wind was so hot, that it seemed as if it came out of hell; and on this day a ger falcon escaped, and flew away.\n \n Outside the city there were two towers, so high that a man could scarcely throw a stone to the top of them. They were made of mud, and the heads of men; and there were air ;two other towers, fallen to the ground. These towers, which are made of heads, are built of the heads of a race of people called “white Tartars,” natives of a country between Turkey and Syria. When Timour Beg departed from Sebastria, and marched towards Damascus, he encountered these people, fought, and conquered them ; taking many prisoners, and sending them to settle at Damghan, which was thinly populated. When they arrived there, they collected together, and lived in the plains, as was their custom. When they were all assembled, they desired to return to their native land, and they set out on their journey, robbing every one they met. When they were near this city, the army of the lord met them, defeated them, and killed them without mercy. The lord then ordered that these four towers should be built, of their heads, plastered together with mud. He also ordered that every white Tartar, wherever he might be found, should be put to death, and so it was done. The army, when they received this order, killed every white Tartar they could find; so that along the roads, in one place ten, in another twenty dead bodies might be seen, and they say that sixty thousand of these Tartars were killed. The people of the city say, that they often see lights burning on the top of these towers in the night.",

    "Description":"On Tuesday, the 22nd of July, they slept at a city called Jagaro, and the day was very hot. This city was in a plain, at the foot of a mountain, without trees, and large pipes lead water from the mountain to the city. In the middle of the city there is a castle, on the top of a mound of earth, and the city had no wall of any kind. In the previous winter there was much snow, and when the summer came, it melted ; and so much water came down the pipes that it ruined the castle, and several houses. The road was very level, and there was not a single stone to be found on it; and the country was very hot, and with little water.\n \n When they arrived, they were given plenty of meat, and fresh horses; and they set out again with the knight whom the great lord had sent, who provided them with food, and with all that they required ; and gave them fresh horses every day, that they might travel faster. The lord had horses waiting at the end of each day's journey, at some places one hundred, and at others two hundred ; and thus the posts were arranged, on the road, as far as Samarcand. Those whom the lord sent in any direction, or who were sent to him, went on these horses as fast as they could, day and night.\n \n [...]\n \n Not only was this road thus supplied with post horses, but there were messengers on all the roads ; so that news could come from every province, in a few days. The lord is better pleased with him who travels a day and night for fifty leagues, and kills two horses, than with him who does the distance in three days.\n \n The great lord, considering that the leagues were very long, in his empire of Samarcand, divided each league into two, and placed small pillars on the roads, to mark each league; ordering all his Zagatays to march twelve, or at least ten of these leagues, in each day's journey. They call these leagues moles, because these turrets, which he caused to be built at the end of each league, and these leagues, the length of which he regulated, are in a country which is called Mogolia. The ambassadors travelled in the country, and saw the pillars, and each of the leagues was equal to two leagues of Castille.\n \n In truth it would scarcely be believed, unless it was actually seen, the distances which these fellows travel, each day and night; for they ride as far as their horses can carry them; and they do not only travel the distance which the lord has ordered, but they sometimes go over fifteen and twenty leagues in a day and night, without any consideration for the toil of their horses. When their horses are knocked up, they kill and sell them, if they are in an inhabited country; but we found many dead horses on the road, which had been killed by hard riding.",

These tents were not made in the usual way, but they were long, and of black cloth, and a people called Alabares lived in them.\n \n These people do not possess anything but their tents, and they do not live in cities or villages, but in the open plains, as well in winter as in summer. They have large flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, besides twenty thousand camels.\n \n They wander, with their flocks and herds, over all the territory of the lord, and pay a yearly tribute of three thousand camels and fifteen thousand sheep to him, for the right of grazing in his territory. When the ambassadors came to their tents, the chief came out, and led them to a tent, and gave them much milk and cream, according to their custom.\n \n They departed from the tents, and set out for the city, but Gomez de Salazar was left behind in a village, very ill, as he could not travel any longer.\n \n The city of Nishapore is in a plain, and is surrounded by gardens, and very handsome houses. The ambassadors were conducted to very fine lodgings, and the chiefs of the city came to them with meat, and fruit, amongst which were very large and good melons, and also they sent them much wine.\n \n After they had eaten, they were presented with a robe, as it was the order of the lord that, whenever they arrived at a city, they should either be presented with a robe or a horse.\n \n This city is very large, and well supplied with all things.\n \n It is the chief city of Media, and here they find torquoises, and, though they are met with in other places, those of Nishapore are the best that are known. They are found in the earth, near a river which descends from a mountain, above the city. The neighbourhood is very populous, and fertile. Here the land of Media ends, and the land of Khorassan commences, which is a great empire.",

These Zagatays have received the privilege from the lord, to go where they like for pasture for their flocks and herds, as well in summer as in winter; and they serve the lord in his wars, whenever they are called for. They do not leave their women, children, and flocks behind, when they go to the wars, but take them all with them. The women, who have little children, when they travel, carry them in small cradles before them, on their horses, and they tie these cradles with broad bands, which they fasten round their waists; and thus they travel with their children, and ride as light as if they were without them. The poor people carry their children and tents on camels, and this way of travelling is very wearisome for the children, as the camels go very uneasily. Not only do these people, whom we met on the road, live in these plains ; but there are a vast number of others, for, when we found some in any place, many others also appeared, in one part or another, and so we travelled amongst them. Near towns, and places where there was water and pasture, we met many of them, and they were so burnt by the sun, that they looked as if they had come out of hell. This country was very flat, and very hot, and most of the troops who followed the lord, travelled by night; and the ambassadors remained amongst these tents of the Zagatays, until night. \n \n On Friday, at noon, they came to a village, where they dined, and took their siesta. In the night they arrived at a great city, the name of which I have forgotten, but it was very large, and formerly it was walled, but now the wall is fallen, and most of the city is deserted, and in this city there were great edifices and mosques.

It is a league in width, and flows through a very flat country, with great and wonderful force, and it is very muddy. It is lowest in winter, because the waters are frozen in the mountains, and the snow does not melt: but in the month of April it begins to increase, and goes on increasing continually for four months ; and this is because the summer melts the ice and snow.\n \n Last summer they said that it had swollen much more than usual; for it increased so much that the water reached a village, near the banks, and destroyed many houses, doing great damage.\n \n This river descends from the mountains, flows through the plains of the territory of Samarcand, and the land of Tartary, and falls into the sea of Bakou. It separates the government of Samarcard from that of Khorassan.",

    "Description":"On the Thursday that the ambassadors reached this great river, they crossed to the other side, and, in the afternoon, they arrived at a great city called Termit, which once belonged to India the Less, but is now in the territory of Samarcand, having been conquered by Timour Beg, and from this place the empire of Samarcand begins. The territory of this empire of Samarcand is called Mongolia, and the language of the people is Mongol, so that those on the other side of the river do not know it, as they speak Persian: and the handwriting which they use on the Samarcand side of the river, is not understood by those on the other side.\n \n The lord has certain scribes who read and write this Mongol writing. The land of Samarcand is very populous, and very rich and fertile.\n \n [Paragraph about customs.]\n \n This city of Termit, which the ambassadors had reached, was very large and populous, and it was without any wall.\n \n The city was surrounded by many gardens and streams of water. I cannot tell you more of this city, because we were very tired when we reached our lodging, except that we passed through populous streets and squares, where they sold many things. The ambassadors were received with much honour, and supplied with all that they required, and were presented with a silken robe. In this city a messenger arrived from the lord, who came to the ambassadors, and said that the lord saluted them, and desired to know how they had borne the journey, and how they had been treated, and whether they would soon arrive. When this messenger departed, they gave him a robe, and they also gave a Florentine robe to the knight who had been sent first, and who had come with them, the ambassador from the Sultan of Babylon doing the same. They also gave a horse to the second knight, whom the lord had sent; for such is the custom of all who come to the lord, to give something, and thus respect the custom of giving and taking presents. Their greatness is considered according to the number of presents they give, in honour of the lord, and such is the measure of the praise they receive.",

These palaces had a long entrance, and a very high gateway. On each side there were arches of brick, covered with glazed tiles, and many patterns in various colours. These arches formed small recesses, without doors, and the ground was paved with glazed tiles. They are made for the attendants to sit in, when the lord is here.\n \n In front of the first entrance there was another gateway, leading to a great court yard paved with white stones, and surrounded by doorways of very rich workmanship. In the centre of the court there was a great pool of water, and this court was three hundred paces wide. The court led to the body of the building, by a very broad and lofty doorway, ornamented with gold and blue patterns on glazed tiles, richly and beautifully worked. On the top of this doorway there was the figure of a lion and a sun, [...]\n \n This doorway led to a reception room, the walls of which were covered with polished glazed tiles, in gold and blue patterns, and the ceiling was gilded all over. Thence the ambassadors were taken to so many chambers, that it would take a long time to describe them all, in which there were ornamental works in gold and blue, and many other colours, executed with wonderful skill. They were also shown the apartments which the lord has caused to be made for his women, which were covered with strange and rich ornaments, both on the walls, ceilings, and floors; and many skilled workmen were employed in this palace.\n \n Afterwards the ambassadors went to see a chamber, which the lord had set apart for feasting, and for the company of his women.\n \n In front of it there was a great garden, in which there were many shady trees, and all kinds of fruit trees, with channels of water flowing amongst them. The garden was so large, that great numbers of people might enjoy themselves there in summer with great delight, near the fountains, and under the shade of the trees. The workmanship of this palace was so rich that it would be impossible to describe it, without gazing and walking over everything, with slow steps. The mosque and palace are amongst the magnificent edifices which the lord has ordered to be built, in honour of his father, who lies interred there, and was a native of this city. But though he was a native of this city, he did not belong to the races of this land, but was of a lineage called Zagatay, which came from the land of Tartary when this country was conquered, as will presently be related to you.",

    "Description":"On Monday, the 29th of September, the lord went to the city of Samarcand, and lodged in some houses near the entrance, which he had ordered to be built in honour of the mother of his wife Caño, who was interred in a chapel within these houses. These houses were very rich, and they were not yet finished, but every day there were men working at them. On this day the lord gave a great feast, and sent for the ambassadors. ...\n \n On this day the ambassadors were brought to the plain, and, when they arrived, they found many handsome tents pitched, most of them on the banks of the river, close together, and it was a very beautiful sight.\n \n The ambassadors went through some streets of tents, where they sold all that was required by this great host; and, when they were near the tents of the lord, they were placed under an awning, made of white linen cloth, ornamented with cloths of various colours, and it was long, and secured above by cords, to two poles, and there were many awnings of this kind on the plain, and they make them long and high, that the sun may be screened off, and that air may enter. \n \n ...\n \n freely. Near these awnings, there was a great and lofty pavilion, which was like a tent, only square, and three lances high. It was a hundred paces broad, and had four corners, and the ceiling was round, like a vault. It was pitched against twelve poles, each as large round as a man, measured round the chest. They were painted gold and blue, and other colours, and from corner to corner there were poles, three fastened together, and making one. When they pitched the tents, they used wheels, like those of a cart, which were turned by men, and they have ropes fixed in various directions, to assist them. From the vault of the ceiling of the pavilion silken cloths descended, between each of the poles, which were fastened to them, and when they were fastened, they made an arch from one side to the other. Outside this square pavilion, there were porticoes, joined above to the pavilion, and supported by twenty-four poles, not so large as the central ones, so that the whole pavilion was supported by thirty-six poles. From this pavilion at least five hundred red cords were extended, and inside there was a crimson carpet, beautifully ornamented with silken cloths of many colours, and embroidered with gold threads. In the centre of the ceiling there was the richest work of all ; and in the four corners were the figures of four eagles, with their wings closed. The outside of the pavilion was lined with silk cloths, in black, white, and yellow stripes.\n \n At each corner there was a high pole, with a copper ball, and the figure of a crescent on the top; and in the centre, there was another tall pole, with a much larger copper ball and crescent; and, on the top of the pavilion, between these poles, there was a tower of silken cloths, with turrets, and an entrance door; and when the wind blew the pavilion about, or made the poles unsteady, men went on the top, and secured anything that was loose. This pavilion was so large and high that, from a distance, it looked like a castle ; and it was a very wonderful thing to see, and possessed more beauty than it is possible to describe.",

    "Description":"In this city of Samarcand there is much merchandize, which comes every year from Cathay, India, Tartary, and many other parts; and as there is not a place for the orderly and regular display of the merchandize for sale, the lord ordered that a street should be made in the city, with shops for the sale of merchandize, This street was commenced at one end of the city, and went through to the other. He entrusted this work to two of his Meerzas, and let them know that if they did not use all diligence to complete it, working day and night, their heads should answer for it.\n \n These Meerzas began to work, by pulling down such houses as stood in the line by which the lord desired the street to run, and as the houses came down, their masters fled with their clothes and all they had : then, as the houses came down in front, the work went on behind. They made the street very broad, and covered it with a vaulted roof, having windows at intervals to let in the light.\n \n As soon as the shops were finished, people were made to occupy them, and sell their goods; and at intervals in this street there were fountains. A great number of workmen came into the city, and those who worked in the daytime, were relieved by others who worked all night. Some pulled down houses, others levelled the ground, and others built the street; and day and night they made such a noise, that they seemed to be like so many devils.\n \n This great work was finished in twenty days, which was very wonderful; and the owners of the houses which were pulled down went to certain Cayris,\" who were friends of the lord ; and one day, when they were playing at chess with the lord, they said that, as he had caused those houses to be destroyed, he ought to make some amends to the owners.",

    "Description":"The city of Samarcand is situated in a plain, and surrounded by an earthen wall. It is a little larger than the city of Seville, but, outside the city, there are a great number of houses, joined together in many parts, so as to form suburbs.\n \n The city is surrounded on all sides by many gardens and vineyards, which extend in some directions a league and a half, in others two leagues, the city being in the middle. In these houses and gardens there is a large population, and there are people selling bread, meat, and many other things; so that the suburbs are much more thickly inhabited than the city within the walls. Amongst these gardens, which are outside the city, there are great and noble houses, and here the lord has several palaces. The nobles of the city have to year their houses amongst these gardens, and they are so extensive that, when a man approaches the city, he sees nothing but a mass of very high trees. Many streams of water flow through the city, and through these gardens, and among these gardens there are many cotton plantations, and melon grounds, and the melons of this land are good and plentiful ; and at Christmas time there is a wonderful quantity of melons and grapes. Every day so many camels come in, laden with melons, that it is a wonder how the people can eat them all.\n \n They preserve them from year in the villages, in the same way as figs, taking off their skins, cutting them in large slices, and then drying them in the sun.\n \n Outside the city there are great plains, which are covered with populous villages, peopled by the captives which the lord caused to be taken from the countries which he conquered. The land is very plentiful in all things, as well bread as wine, fruit, meat, and birds; and the sheep are very large, and have long tails, some weighing twenty pounds, and they are as much as a man can hold in his hand. These sheep are so abundant in the market that, even when the lord was there with all his host, a pair was worth only a ducat. Other things are so plentiful, that for a meri, which is half a rial, they sell a fanegal and a half of barley, and the quantity of bread and rice is infinite.\n \n The city is so large, and so abundantly supplied, that it is wonderful; and the name of Samarcand or Cimes-quinte is derived from the two words cimes great, and quinte a town. The supplies of this city do not consist of food alone, but of silks, satins, gauzes, tafetas, velvets, and other things. The lord had so strong a desire to ennoble this city, that he brought captives to increase its population, from every land which he conquered, especially all those who were skilful in From Damascus he brought weavers of silk, and men who made bows, glass, and earthenware, so that, of those articles, Samarcand produces the best in the world. From Turkey he brought archers, masons, and silversmiths. He also brought men skilled in making engines of war : and he sowed hemp and flax, which had never before been seen in the land.\n \n There was so great a number of people brought to this city, from all parts, both men and women, that they are said to have amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand persons, of many nations, Turks, Arabs, and Moors, Christian Armenians, Greek Catholics, and Jacobites, and those who baptize with fire in the face, who are Christians with peculiar opinions. There was such a multitude of these people that the city was not large enough to hold them, and it was wonderful what a number lived under trees, and in caves outside.\n \n The city is also very rich in merchandize which comes from other parts. Russia and Tartary send linen and skins ; China sends silks, which are the best in the world, (more especially the satins), and musk, which is found in no other part of the world, rubies and diamonds, pearls and rhubarb, and many other things. The merchandize which comes from China is the best and most precious which comes to this city, and they say that the people of China are the most skilful workmen in the world. They say themselves that they have two eyes, the Franks one, and that the Moors are blind, so that they have the advantage of every other nation in the world. From India come spices, such as nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, ginger, and many others which do not reach Alexandria.\n \n In the city there are many open places, in which they sellmeat cooked in many ways, fowls and other birds very nicely dressed ; and they are always selling, day and night, in these places. There are also many places for killing meat, fowls, pheasants, and partridges. At one end of the city there is a castle, which is defended on one side by a stream flowing through a deep ravine, and is very strong. The lord kept his treasure in that castle, and no man entered it except the magistrate and his officers. In this castle the lord had as many as a thousand captives, who were skilful workmen, and laboured all the year round at making head pieces, and bows and arrows.",

On the banks there were great plains of sand, and the sand was moved from one part to another, by the wind, and thrown up in mounds. In this sandy waste there are great valleys and hills, and the wind blew the sand away from one hill to another, for it was very light; and on the ground, where the wind had blown away the sand, the marks of waves and could not keep their eyes on this sand, when the sun was shining. This road cannot be travelled over, without a guide who knows the marks and signs of the desert, and these guides are called Anchies, and the ambassadors had one of these guides. On this road there is no water, except a few wells sunk in the sand, with vaulted roofs, and surrounded by brick walls, for if they were not covered, the sand would fill them up. The water of these wells is either rain or snow water; and in the last day's journey, they found no water, and they travelled all night; but at the hour of mass they came to a well, and drank, and gave water to their beasts, and they all had much need of it.\n \n [Location uncertain]",

They were eight days in this city, because they were forced to go and visit a grandson of the lord Timour Beg, named Omar Meerza, who was lord of Persia and other countries, and was wintering with his host in the plain which they call Karabagh. The most direct road to go there was by this city of Sultanieh, but as there was much snow on a range of mountains which they would have to cross, they waited until it became passable. Finally they were advised to go on to the city of Tabreez, whence they might more easily reach Karabagh, and they decided upon doing so.",

It is not yet determined whether it is an island or a main continent; but I am certain that it joins neither to Asia, Africa, nor America. This part of it that we saw is all low even land, with sandy banks against the sea, only the points are rocky, and so are some of the islands in this bay. The land is of a dry sandy soil, destitute of water except you make wells; yet producing divers sorts of trees; but the woods are not thick, nor the trees very big. Most of the trees that we saw are dragon-trees as we supposed; and these too are the largest trees of any there. They are about the bigness of our large apple-trees, and about the same height; and the rind is blackish and somewhat rough. The leaves are of a dark colour; the gum distils out of the knots or cracks that are in the bodies of the trees. We compared it with some gum-dragon or dragon's blood that was aboard, and it was of the same colour and taste. The other sort of trees were not known by any of us. There was pretty long grass growing under the trees; but it was very thin. We saw no trees that bore fruit or berries. We saw no sort of animal nor any track of beast but once; and that seemed to be the tread of a beast as big as a great mastiff-dog. Here are a few small land-birds but none bigger than a blackbird; and but few sea-fowls. Neither is the sea very plentifully stored with fish unless you reckon the manatee and turtle as such. Of these creatures there is plenty but they are extraordinary shy; though the inhabitants cannot trouble them much having neither boats nor iron.",

The soil is tolerably good within a mile and a half of the banks: I rode five or six miles out, in hopes of finding some eminence on which to ascend, but was disappointed, the country continuing a dead level, with extensive swamps, and barren brushes. The timber, dwarf box, and gum trees (all eucalypti), with a few cypresses and camarinas, scattered here and there: few traces of the natives were seen, and none recent. Upon the swamps were numerous swans and other wild fowl. In the evening we caught nearly a hundred weight of fine fish.",

    "Description":"I found Lake Torrens completely girded by a steep sandy ridge, exactly like the sandy ridges bounding the sea shore, no rocks or stones were visible any where, but many saline coasts peeped out in the outer ridge, and upon descending westerly to its basin, I found the dry bed of the lake coated completely over with a crust of salt, forming one unbroken sheet of pure white, and glittering brilliantly in the sun. On stepping upon this I found that it yielded to the foot, and that below the surface the bed of the lake consisted of a soft mud, and the further we advanced to the westward the more boggy it got, so that at last it became quite impossible to proceed, and I was obliged to return to the outer margin of the lake without ascertaining whether there was water on the surface of its bed further west or not. The extraordinary deception caused by mirage and refraction, arising from the state of the atmosphere in these regions, makes it almost impossible to believe the evidence of one's own eyesight; but as far as I could judge under these circumstances, it appeared to me that there was water in the bed of the lake at a distance of four or five miles from where I was, and at this point Lake Torrens was about fifteen or twenty miles across, having high land bounding it to the west, seemingly a continuation of the table land at the head of Spencer's gulf on its western side. Foiled in the hope of reaching the water, I stood gazing on the dismal prospect before me with feelings of chagrin and gloom. I can hardly say I felt disappointed, for my expectations in this quarter had never been sanguine; but I could not view unmoved, a scene which from its character and extent, I well knew must exercise a great influence over my future plans and hopes: the vast area of the lake was before me interminable as far as the eye could see to the northward, and the country upon its shore, was desolate and forbidding. It was evident, that I could never hope to take my party across the lake, and it was equally evident, that I should not be able to travel around its shores, from the total absence of all fresh water, grass, or wood, whilst the very saline nature of the soil in the surrounding country, made even the rain water salt, after lying for an hour or two upon the ground. My only chance of success now lay in the non-termination of Flinders range, and in the prospect it held out to me, that by continuing our course along it we might be able to procure grass and water in its recesses, until we were either taken beyond Lake Torrens, or led to some practicable opening to the north.",

For seven miles the country continued gently to ascend, the sandstone giving place to trap boulders, yielding a very rich soil, clothed with short green grass and melons, the soil being too stony for agricultural purposes, although I have seen country of a similar appearance in the island of Mauritius producing fine crops of sugar. Some of the melons weighed as much as five or six ounces, and were passably good eating, although rather bitter. At noon the country dropped suddenly to the northward, and we descended a deep rocky ravine, in which we soon found water and grass. Travelling now became difficult and sometimes dangerous to the horses; rugged and semi-columnar metamorphic sandstone cliffs hemmed in the ravines on either side, while large rounded boulders of trap-rock filled the bed of the stream, which in several places was running. We had a rather indifferent camp in latitude 21 degrees 29 minutes 10 seconds, the camp at Nickol Bay bearing west-north-west, distant seventy-five miles by account. Camp 40.",

    "Description":"I have now spent several weeks in New York, but shall postpone for the present any remarks upon the social, moral, or political characteristics of its inhabitants, in the hope that I shall hereafter have abundant opportunities of more extensive observation; the remaining pages of this letter shall rather be devoted to brief notices of the more remarkable peculiarities of their city. New York is built upon the southern point of Manhattan island, and enjoys a situation in every respect admirably suited for commercial purposes. The Hudson, or North River, passes it upon the one side; a narrow part of Long Island Sound, familiarly termed the East River, washes it upon the other; while in front is a noble bay, expanding between the shores of Long Island and New Jersey, in which the united navies of the world might spread their canvass. Below the bay are the Narrows, facilitating the defence of the harbour, and at various points above and below them are forts of such imposing strength, that it seems impossible that any naval armament can ever reach the city, unless in consequence of the co-operating exertions of a powerful land force. Ice very rarely, now, obstructs the navigation, and about twenty miles from the city the Atlantic opens to the vessels, without a rock or island thereafter to annoy them. With the eastern coast of\nAmerica, there is a convenient and safe communication through Long Island Sound; and the Hudson, having its source in the upper part of the state, affords an inland navigation, even for large vessels, of more than a hundred and fifty miles. The harbour of New York is one of the best in the country, and is capable of almostunlimited extension. The wharfs skirt both sides of the island, and piers project at rightangles into the stream, leaving intermediate slips, which have many of the advantagesof wet docks and are free from several of their inconveniences. The tides rise and fallabout six feet, but there is always water enough abreast of the piers to float the largestmerchantmen. They do not however enjoy the advantage of dry docks, for the tide doesnot ebb sufficiently to empty them and mechanical means have not yet been resorted to;but vessels which need repair are hove down in shallow water, first upon the one side and then upon the other.",

    "Description":"Boston occupies a small peninsula in Massachusetts bay, and possesses a safe and commodious harbour, strongly defended from maritime attacks. The commerce of Boston is very considerable; probably in this respect it ranks as the fourth city in the United States,\nfor New York, Philadelphia, and I believe New Orleans, are before it. The town has outgrown the limits of the position which it occupies, and Charlestown upon an opposite peninsula, and South Boston upon the main land, may be regarded as integral parts of the city. Circumscribed, however, as they are, the citizens have had the good taste to reserve a park of upwards of forty acres, upon which no buildings have been allowed to encroach. The Mall, as this is called, is surrounded with spreading elms, and is the finest that is to be found within the limits of any considerable town in the United States. It would be needless to remark how much it contributes to the beauty of the town, and the comfort of the inhabitants, were it not that so simple and so obvious an ornament is strangely overlooked in the larger American cities, notwithstanding the abundance of elbow room which all of them enjoy. Boston has much more of the appearance of a British town than New York. Many of the buildings are of a fine white granite, and most of the others are of brick; the streets are very compactly built, and although many are narrow and crooked, all exhibit a degree of order and cleanliness which will in vain be looked for in New York. On a finely rising ground at the upper part of the Mall, stands the State House, a building of humbler\npretensions as to size and materials than the New York City Hall, but in situation and architectural outline greatly superior. It is nearly square; in front is a lofty projecting colonnade of the Corinthian order, twelve columns in length, springing from a piazza of rusticated arches, but unhappily bearing only a balustrade, over which rises a small attic story with a pediment; and overtopping all is a large circular dome terminated by a small square lantern. From the lantern of the State House a most commanding view is obtained\nof the surrounding country. In front is Boston bay, studded with nearly forty islands, with fortifications and a light house; the shores which surround its ample basin, advancing and receding with most capricious irregularity, and forming numerous capes and peninsulas,\non one of the largest of which is the city. The vast amphitheatre around the bay exhibits a country richly variegated with hill and valley, immense forests and cultivated ground; and sprinkled with about twenty little towns of snowy whiteness, among which a dozen of\nspires may be counted.",

    "Description":"The position of Philadelphia, although not equal to that of New York, is yet well chosen in reference to the character of the surrounding country. The city stands upon an isthmus about two miles wide, between the Delaware and the Schuylkill, five miles above their confluence, and about an hundred and twenty miles from the sea. Both rivers are navigable up to the city by the largest merchantmen. The Delaware is here about a mile in width; the tide rises and falls about six feet, and vessels of 1200 tons can come up to the wharfs. In severe winters, the communication with the sea is still occasionally interrupted; but not so frequently as formerly, nor for so long at one time, and as the surrounding country becomes cleared of its forests the severity of the winters will be still\nfarther mitigated. The course of the two rivers at the city is very nearly north and south, but almost immediately above, they diverge; the Delaware to the northeast, and the Schuylkill to the north-west, thus materially facilitating the commercial communication with the interior of the State, and the adjoining one of New Jersey. The Delaware is navigable by large sloops and steam boats to Trenton, about thirty miles above, and the Schuylkill, although above the city comparatively shallow and disturbed with rapids, is navigable by small vessels and rafts to a considerable distance. A little deepening of this river in some places, and the cutting of short canals from one stream to another, would open a communication for some hundreds of miles into the interior. The ground on which the city stands, is covered with a stratum of fine clay; the banks of the Schuylkill furnish a plentiful supply of marble, and the country around is rich in timber, so that materials for building are most abundant. The appearance of the city from the river is by no means imposing; rather the opposite. The ground is generally level, and the mass of buildings present a dull heavy uniformity; most of those along the bank are by no means elegant, and only a solitary steeple rises above the dense horizon. The aspect however improves amazingly when you enter the streets, which are wide, straight, and clean, and, with only one exception, cross each other at right angles. The houses are in general of painted brick, but some of the more modern have a flight of marble steps in front, and the lintels of the doors and windows, and even the side walk in front, are of the same beautiful materials.",

    "Description":"Baltimore is built at the top of a small bay in the river Patapsco, near its entrance into the Chesapeake, and consists of two portions, nearly a mile asunder; the upper of which is properly speaking the town, and the lower called Fell's Point is the harbour. The water comes up to the town but it is shallow and in general none but coasters go past the Point. The bay is formed and protected by a peninsular tongue of land which stretches downwards into the river; the entrance is narrow and is completely commanded by a fort,\nwhich sustained a heavy bombardment during last war. The town is built with considerable regularity, upon portions of three hills and their intervening 220 valleys; many of the streets cross each other at right angles, and they are in general spacious and well paved. A large proportion of the buildings are of brick; the more ancient, in consequence of inattention to painting, have rather a gloomy aspect, but the modern ones resemble in every respect those of New York and Philadelphia. In public buildings Baltimore aspires to distinction, but some of the most considerable are as yet only in progress. A massy brick edifice which is intended for an Exchange has been roofed in; externally it is remarkable for dimensions rather than elegance, and of its internal appearance I can say nothing. Two new churches are going forward, the one destined to be a Romish Cathedral the other a Socinian Chapel. They stand very near each other, rather above the city, and as yet a considerable space is open around them.\nThe style of the respective buildings strikes me as somewhat appropriate to the system which it has been erected to support.",

    "Description":"I Have now the honour of addressing you from the metropolis of the United States. It is common here to call Washington ‘the city in the woods,’ I was therefore somewhat surprised to find that there is little or no wood near it. The aspect of the city indeed would have been much improved by a few trees, to fill up the vacancies, and thus afford something for the eye to rest upon between one group of buildings and another. The soil however is poor, and the probability is that there has never been much timber on this spot;\nI have noticed none of the stumps which are usually left when the forests are felled. The position which was selected for the Federal city, is a point of land embraced by the forking of the river Potowmak, about one hundred and twenty miles from its junction with the Chesapeake, and about two hundred and fifty miles from the sea. The principal branch of the river flows down upon the west, and unites with the smaller one from the eastward in front of the city. Ships of war of the largest size can float in safety three or four\nmiles above the junction of the streams. It was expected that this situation would have been found particularly favourable to commercial enterprize, and consequently that the population would rapidly increase; hitherto however these hopes have not been realized.\nGeorgetown, about a mile above upon the principal branch of the river, monopolizes the inland trade, and Alexandria seven miles below intercepts the foreign; while the barrenness of the surrounding country is discouraging to settlers. The prosperity of Washington therefore seems to be in a great measure dependent on its advantages as the seat of government, and these in a new government, economical even to penuriousness in the salaries of its public officers, cannot as yet be very important....The original plan of the city was on a most extensive scale. A parallelogram more than four miles and a half long, and two miles broad, was regularly divided into streets, avenues, and squares, and should the anticipations of its founders be realized, this will after all be but the nucleus of the future metropolis. The streets are laid out towards the cardinal points, crossing each other at right angles; the avenues intersect these diagonally, so as to avoid the tiresome sameness which is observable in Philadelphia, and extensive squares are to be placed at the crossings of these transverse lines. The avenues are from 130 to 160 feet wide, the streets from 80 to 110.",

    "Description":"Albany was, an early Dutch settlement and the streets are filled with Dutch names, of most difficult and cacophonous utterance. The town consisted originally of a single street, skirting the bank of the river, which takes a slight bend here; but it subsequently extended backwards very considerably, and some of the recent streets towards the north are spacious and well built, and as usual lined with poplars. In many places there is a singular mixture of poverty and splendour. A number of the old Dutch erections are still standing; small houses of red and yellow bricks, with the gable end to the street, having a door and window in the ground floor, a single window in the next, and above it the year of their erection embossed upon the surface in huge iron figures, and the whole surmounted with an iron weather-cock rusted upon the rod. There is an air of antiquity about these buildings, which is interesting in a country where antiquity is so rare. The modern erections exhibit the same tasteful style which prevails in New York and Philadelphia. Two or three of the public buildings are of white marble; one of them is surmounted with a very neat dome, but in another the effect of the marble wall is sadly disfigured by the untasteful addition of a red tiled roof. The Capitol, or State House has rather a neat portico, and a dome surmounted with a statue of Justice; it stands at the upper end of a very steep but wide street, running at right angles to the river. Near the Capitol is a very neat Academy with two wings, built of reddish coloured freestone.",

    "Description":"On Jan. 27, 1833, I arrived in York—now changed to Toronto, its aborigine name—the capital of Upper Canada. A very few years since the wilderness, a swamp and unknown; the whole country, up to 1784, being one vast forest: it now contains over 10,000 inhabitants. A cedar swamp produces good water, and is of itself healthy; which is likewise the case where hemlock, spruce and fir abound. General Simcoe, the first governor of the province, chose Toronto, which he called, little York, in 1794, as the best scite [sic] for a capital, though he contemplated London, in the London District, from its central position between the large lakes, and its favorable situation on the river Thames. Toronto is a mass of shops, the leading feature of Canadian and American towns, 75 insomuch\nthat you can hardly sneeze without bespattering a store. Its winters are six weeks shorter than those of Quebec. The original settlers of Upper Canada, (discovered by John Cabot, in 1497, whose family resided in England) were American refugees, and part of the 82nd\nregiment, disbanded on termination of the revolutionary war. Each private receiving 200 acres, without restrictions, but on discovering they would sell them for a bottle of brandy, the grant was reduced to 100, with settlement duties, and a residence of three years before enabled to sell. They located on the Long Sault, and at Niagara, formerly Newark. The first vessel which entered the Bay of Toronto, was a brig commanded by capt. Richardson, whose son is an elder in the Episcopal Methodist Society of this city. Twenty–seven steamboats ply on Lake Ontario, Bay of Quinte, and river St. Lawrence: I have counted seven at a time in Toronto Bay. Cranberry marshes in the township of Wedderburn, on account of their fever–breeding properties, are called the Infernal place: a Mr. J. Cummer, farmer and miller of Yonge Street, was the first person born in the township of Toronto: in 1834 he was thirty–five years of age. The episcopal–church is a well–built stone structure, has a choir and organ, and will contain 3000 persons. There are two catholic chapels in the city, three methodist, and four other places of public worship. The establishment of Upper Canada consists of the bishop of Quebec, two archdeacons, and circa sixty clergymen",

Here, I think, we first realized the strange incongruities of Canada; the mixture of advanced civilization with provincial incompleteness, as shown by these rough unfinished Canadian roads lighted up by brilliant electric light. Streets here are reckoned by miles; but they dwindle away into what we should consider merely “tracks,” and even in the cities themselves this curious anomaly is ever present: a handsome brick or stone house, and, next door to it, a wooden\nhovel; electric light, lighting up roads covered with “rocks” or impassable from mud or pools of water. But we toiled up above all these queer contrasts and the ugly provincial rectangular town, to Barrack Hill and the beautiful Government buildings of pink and cream sandstone; and a lovely autumn picture remains in my memory: on one side of the buildings a deep ravine, clothed with trees arrayed in all their autumn bravery; on the other a far-away stretch of wood and river, the Chaudière Falls as a background, and the famous lumber yards, looking quite picturesque, thanks to the enchantment of distance and the last lingering touch of a quickly sinking sun. The bright, crisp air turns suddenly grey and chill, and we hasten home to make final preparations for our start to Toronto\nand a first night in the famous Pullman cars.",

    "Description":"The sun of a November morning had just risen as I left Albany, and in a short time beamed upon swelling hills, green savannahs, and waving woods fringing the margin of the Hudson. At Coxsackie the river expands into a small lake, and the majestic Catsgill Mountains rise abruptly from the western side. The scenery among these mountains is very grand and varied. Its silence and rugged sublimity recall the Old World: it has rocky pinnacles and desert passes, inaccessible eminences and yawning chasms. The world might grow populous at the feet of the Catsgills, but it would leave them untouched and unprofaned in their stern majesty. From this point for a hundred miles the eyes of the traveller are perfectly steeped in beauty, which, gathering and increasing, culminates at West Point, a lofty eminence jutting upon a lake apparently without any outlet. The spurs of mountain ranges which meet here project in precipices from five to fifteen hundred feet in height; trees find a place for their roots in every rift among the rocks; festoons of clematis and wild-vine hang in graceful drapery from base to summit, and the dark mountain shadows loom over the lake-like expanse below. The hand wearies of writing of the loveliness of this river. I saw it on a perfect day. The Indian summer lingered, as though unwilling that the chilly blasts of winter should blight the loveliness of this beauteous scene. The gloom of autumn was not there, but its glories were on every leaf and twig. The bright scarlet of the maple vied with the brilliant berries of the rowan, and from among the tendrils of the creepers, which were waving in the sighs of the west wind, peeped forth the deep crimson of the sumach. There were very few signs of cultivation; the banks of the Hudson are barren in all but beauty. The river is a succession of small wild lakes, connected by narrow reaches, bound for ever between abrupt precipices. There are lakes more beauteous than Loch Katrine, softer in their features than Loch Achray, though like both, or like the waters which glitter beneath the blue sky of Italy. Along their margins the woods hung in scarlet and gold— high above towered the purple peaks—the blue waters flashed back the rays of a sun shining from an unclouded sky—the air was warm like June—and I think the sunbeams of that day scarcely shone upon a fairer scene. At mid-day the Highlands of Hudson were left behind—the mountains melted into hills—the river expanded into a noble stream about a mile in width—the scarlet woods, the silvery lakes, and the majestic Catsgills faded away in the distance; and with a whoop, and a roar, and a clatter, the cars entered into, and proceeded at slackened speed down, a long street called Tenth Avenue, among carts, children, and pigs.",

    "Description":"The exploit is one of the most agreeable which the traveller can perform, and the thick morning mist added to the apparent danger. We steamed for four or five miles farther down the river, when suddenly the great curtain of mist was rolled up as by an invisible hand, and the scene which it revealed was Montreal. I never saw a city which looked so magnificent from the water. It covers a very large extent of ground, which gently slopes upwards from the lake-like river, and is backed by the Mountain, a precipitous hill, 700 feet in height. It is decidedly foreign in appearance, even from a distance. When the fog cleared away it revealed this mountain, with the forest which covers it, all scarlet and purple; the blue waters of the river hurried joyously along; the Green and Belleisle mountains wore the rosy tints of dawn; the distances were bathed in a purple glow; and the tin roofs, lofty spires, and cupolas of Montreal flashed back the beams of the rising sun. A lofty Gothic edifice, something from a distance like Westminster Abbey, and handsome public buildings, with a superb wharf a mile long, of hewn stone, present a very imposing appearance from the water. We landed from the first lock of a ship-canal, and I immediately drove to the residence of the Bishop of Montreal, a house near the mountain, in a very elevated situation, and commanding a magnificent view. From the Bishop and his family I received the greatest kindness, and have very agreeable recollections of Montreal....Montreal is an extraordinary place. It is alive with business and enterprising traders, with soldiers, carters, and equipages. Through the kindness of the Bishop, I saw everything of any interest in the town. The first thing which attracted my attention was the magnificent view from the windows of the See-house, over the wide St. Lawrence and the green mountains of Vermont; the next, an immense pair of elaborately-worked bronze gates, at a villa opposite, large enough for a royal residence. The side-walks in the outskirts of the town were still of the villanous wood, but in the streets they were very substantial, and, like the massive stone houses, look as if they had lasted for two hundred years, and might last for a thousand more",

It is true we know not what awaits us in other portions of this Golden State, but we are constantly meeting people who having tried a residence in all other localities, return delightedly to this beautiful San Gabriel Valley. Along its northern borders stretches the Sierra Madre range of mountains, a barrier that effectually protects the city nestling at its feet from every rude, cold blast, and adds to it yet another blessing, that of pure water, the principal supply coming from Devil's Gate, though one would naturally look for fire from this source rather than cooling springs. The charm also of grandeur and sublimity, Pasadena by this proximity, does not lack. With David, we “lift our eyes unto the hills,” for we cannot help it. They entice us, they appall us, they command our reverence, they invite our ever changing admiration by their shifting phases. Severe in outline, seamed with gorges, and chasms, producing thus a strange wrinkled effect as if some Titan hand held aloft a vast drapery that thence fell naturally in seam, and crease, and fold; almost barren of vegetation, seemingly unwooded, though we are assured that impenetrable forests exist in some of their wildest depths, but in compensation for this softening charm of New England hills, the loftier Sierras veil themselves in shadowy mists and vapors, they play hide seek with fleecy clouds, that drift across their breasts and lurk in their deep valleys, while still rearing aloft their hoary heads into the clear blue ether which envelopes them with a light that was never seen before on sea or land, while grander than all, old “Baldy” smiles down on the fertile valley from his realm of snow. Cruel mothers (madres), these jagged peaks have proved to many venturesome climbers, nearly a dozen people having perished here in the last three years, in sight of home, being lured into some chasm, or death-trap, from which there was no escape.",

    "Description":"From earliest childhood the praises of Santa Barbara, more than of any other spot in California have been chanted in our ears; it has been pictured as the most favored haunt of Flora and Pomona, the chosen resort of poet and artist who find in its golden, dolce far niente atmosphere that inspiration sought in vain in harsher climes. It has offered health to the invalid, peace to the restless and broken in spirit, wealth to the investor, a perpetual delight to the visiting traveller, such as no other locality can, because forsooth, there is but one Santa Barbara in the world. Extravagant anticipations are rarely realized. Perhaps we had expected too much, or it was unfortunate that we did not visit this spot prior to our acquaintance with Pasadena, the contrast to that city's immaculate neatness and lavish cultivation being here so marked. Yet charms Santa Barbara undoubtedly possesses of a very high order. Its climate is perhaps without a parallel. Unlike many other southern resorts which omit winter from their calendar, it omits summer also, so that there is almost no change of seasons. Its placid resident does not spend six months of every year in preparing for the remaining semester, as in less favored New England. He knows neither torrid days nor frigid nights; the wear and tear of life is reduced to a minimum, likewise it would seem its zest and highest achievement. Mercury seldom ranges higher than our average summer days, and never drops to the freezing point. The most tender flowers bloom perpetually, unless forced to rest by being deprived of irrigation. Fruits of all kinds are always ripe. Strawberry short-cake was served in the waning days of November, also green peas, and tomatoes from a plant seven years old, that had borne continually. Oh yes, a climate that can lead the world we cheerfully concede to Santa Barbara. It is also “beautiful for situation,” covering the pleasant slope from the base of the Santa Ynez mountains, which form its picturesque background, down to the lovely Bay, not unlike the Bay of Naples in contour, whose misty horizon line is broken twenty miles away by three verdant islands, one of them being used as a ranch by the largest sheep owners in the world. There is also here a pretty curving beach, too rocky however for comfortable bathing, with a swiftly-running surf that one can stand to his heart's content to enjoy, but there is no opportunity to sit and list to the wild wave's roar, for a brief moment.",

    "Description":"Pasadena has a twin, and her name is Riverside. They are both “in verdure clad” right royally, and possess many attributes in common, resembling each other more closely perhaps in age, in rapid growth, and many minor characteristics than any other two cities of California. Pasadena is much the larger place; and while conceding to it a superior situation, a beauty of adornment, and a home-like charm found nowhere else, we must grant to Riverside the palm of fruit-culture. The acme of orange-fruitage is certainly attained here, both in extent and in quality. The orchards are indeed “groves,” the trees being so large and full as to completely overshadow and hide the residences, which we know exist somewhere in their green depths. Riverside is situated in San Bernardino County, seven miles from Colton. This county, by the way, is the largest in the United States. Within its borders fifteen States the size of “little Rhody” could be placed without crowding. The Santa Ana river runs through the neighborhood, hence the name—Riverside—chosen for the settlement in 1871, when the gigantic scheme for irrigation was begun. The soil of Riverside is a red clay mixed with sand—washed probably from the mountain,—a most unpromising, sterile-looking soil, but needing evidently only a little scratching and a plentiful supply of water to prove itself especially adapted to fruits of all kinds. Energetic labor was not lacking in the early settlers of this happily chosen locality, and their canal system of irrigation challenges the admiration of every visitor. The river above the town was tapped, and two cemented canals constructed, twelve and fourteen miles long, ten to twenty feet wide, from which sub-canals (100 miles of them) surround every block, with gateways through which the water can be admitted to the grounds from the main artery, at pleasure....The show-card of Riverside is of course Magnolia Avenue, the finest drive it is claimed in the world. To reach it, however, a drive of three miles from our pleasant quarters at the Glenwood is necessary. Back of Riverside as at Pasadena is an arroyo, or valley, 40 feet deep and a quarter of a mile wide. Crossing this, we, reach a portion of the town known as Brockton square, because its residents are all natives of that thriving city of Mass. Next comes a strip of Government land, a mile wide, and then the tract named by some New York investors, Arlington, through which the beautiful avenue runs. Its width of 132 feet is divided into a double drive by a magnificent continuous row of pepper-trees through its centre. On either side, and between the drives and the 20 feet wide promenades, is a varied growth of trees and palms, evergreens, the eucalyptus, which unless trimmed grows 8 to 15 feet in height every year, the beautiful gravilia, and at the four corners of each intersecting avenue, a magnolia tree. Extend this vista, flecked with its enchanting lights and shades, its sunbeams crossed by waving branches, for ten miles. Imagine on its outer borders a thick green hedge which encloses residences that here find frontage, or orange groves that are simply endless in every direction, their glossy green boughs weighed down with their wealth of ripened fruit, and one can readily believe it all seems too lovely to be true, like an illusion of some magician's wand.",

    "Description":"The modern city of San Diego is regularly laid out with broad avenues, suitably numbered and lettered, and very level, excepting on its northern boundary where Florence Hill rises somewhat abruptly, crowned with fine residences. Its stores have an Eastern look, and the prices of goods are very reasonable. Its people are pleasant and affable, and many are of New England birth. The chief natural charm of San Diego is undoubtably its equable climate, its uniform spring-like temperature, in summer or in winter; added to this, there is a buoyancy, a remarkable uplifting quality in the atmosphere. One does not feel that he weighs an ounce in San Diego, although the scales show a steady upward-going endency. There are sea-turns and breezes occasionally, but these are tempered by the peninsula which lies between the Bay and the Ocean—fair Coronado. And one attempts the description of this exceptionable seaside-resort most reluctantly, for it must be seen and felt to be thoroughly appreciated. With a temperature that allows fruits of tropical and temperate zones to ripen side by side, with a bay and an ocean on either hand, its beach one of the finest in the world, its surf magnificent, and with a radiant sunlit atmosphere that no pen can ever portray, or brush transmit, what wonder that this location was chosen for that Aladdin's palace—the Hotel del Coronado, the largest on the globe. It is a unique structure, with an architectural style of its own, stretching itself easily and gracefully over seven acres of ground, enclosing thus a courtyard where rare flowers bloom beneath the dashing spray of fountains, and palms shade the walks that lead thither from the drawing and music rooms, from rotunda and many private diningrooms that border this garden. When at evening electric lights shed their glamour o'er the scene, touching the verdure with such livid brilliancy, when choice music adds its charm to the soft air, when fair forms picturesquely clad, float in and out from light to shadow, we realize that childhood's dreams of fairy-land were all true and are now realized. Rumors reached our celibate ears of wonderful bridal suites in unvisited regions of this vast place that are dreams of Oriental splendor, but we gained or coveted no nearer acquaintance with their white and golden elegance. Besides this hotel, a thriving little town has sprung up on the peninsula in the last three years, with an ostrich farm, and pleasant little parks. Communication with the main land is by ferry-boat. Many delightful trips can be enjoyed from San Diego, one to Lakeside, a mountainous district in the Cajone canon, another to Ensenada, Mexico, by steamer, or, the Mexican border can also be reached by a twenty-mile ride in an open motor-car along the Bay to National City (a stirring place which still shows many evidences of a mushroom growth), through its suburbs, where olives are extensively cultivated, and from which diverges the road to Sweetwater Dam, the city's reservoir, thence across a desolate country given over to cacti of various kinds and grease-wood bushes, whose oily roots are sought for fuel, to Tia Juana where one can visit the Government building and be officially stamped, or drive to the monument marking the boundary line between California and Mexico.",

The fact that the site chosen for the city was a succession of hills and ridges proved no insurmountable obstacle. We had heard that San Francisco was built upon one hundred hills. We have not counted them, but do not believe the number overestimated. And such hills! The usual comparison “steep as the roof of a house” does only partial justice to their acute incline. Nothing could climb some of them it would seem but a cat or a squirrel and yet up their successive and thickly settled terraces mount steadily and speedily the cable cars with which the city is completely honeycombed in every direction, naught but the tops of their roofs being visible to the observer at the foot of the hill. And, reaching the summit, the cars pitch almost perpendicularly downward as a fly descends the walls of a room, or as a ship dips into the trough of a heavy sea, only to mount a higher and steeper hill beyond, continuing this see-sawing, style of locomotion for miles all over the city. Exaggeration here is an impossibility, for it is all so utterly incredible, even while we gaze.",

    "Description":"Six miles from San Francisco, as the sea-gull flies, across the pleasant waters of the bay, stands the beautiful city of Oakland, with Alameda and Berkeley on either side. Oakland has been called the city of residences (or in slang parlance, Frisco's bedroom), and it wears the title appropriately. It has a diurnal population of about 65,000, and while possessing a thriving little business centre of its own, its wide level streets are chiefly occupied by beautiful villas and homes. The gardens which surround them remind us at this winter season of Pasadena taking a nap, and an opossum kind of nap too, a partial rest with one eye open, for Nature never sleeps in this wondrous land. Everywhere rose bushes are bristling with buds that await only a few more (lays of sunshine to expand, magnolias promise even earlier unfoldment, and the callas are already in their prime; indeed Oakland seems pre-eminently their chosen home, for every yard displays its abundant share of these snowy, mammoth 82 flowers. And we note here such variety of trees from the native live-oak, (whose abundance christened the city), the locust and cottonwood, to the ornate, feathery-leaved acacia, in its many subdivisions, the mustard, fig, cypress, and numberless varieties of palms. We counted fifteen new specimens of trees and shrubs which we had never seen before, in one short walk, and were obliged to remain in ignorance as to their proper classification, for the resident, to the manor born, never knows, and doesn't even know that he does not know...The social atmosphere of Oakland is genial, quiet, restful and receptive to the advanced thought of the day. For this and many other reasons the traveller is induced to cast anchor in this calm haven and taste the rare pleasure of a long sojourn in this lovely place, indeed a life-sentence could be delightfully served out, here. The climate, while not so mild in winter as southern resorts, knows no sultry weather in mid-summer. Its sky is often blue and serene when a small hurricane is blowing through the streets of the larger city across the bay. There is a beautiful lake in the eastern part of Oakland surrounded by handsome villas, and in every direction there are the most enticing walks and drives, one of especial charm leading out to Piedmont, situated as its name implies, on the foot-hills of the Contra Costa range. A more magnificent view than the one obtained from this height can hardly be imagined. Oakland lies at our feet like a crescent moon; just beyond, Alameda stretches her long arm into the blue bay; on the further shore of this broad expanse of waters, San Francisco sits on her many hills, while others still higher,rise behind her. From our vantage ground we can look straight through the Golden Gate, in whose royal portals the white masts of coming and departing vessels are tipped with flame in the light of the setting sun, which makes a long lane of glory between the green islands of this inland sea. What peace rests upon it! What diverse craft here find anchorage! At present there are Her Britannic Majesty's flag-ship Swiftshire, our own Charleston, in virgin white from stem to stern, a French man-of-war, and the Chinese mail steamer, together with sloops, whalers, ferry-boats and tugs innumerable, plying busily in every direction.",

There are two miles of beautiful beach within the city limits, and in the cliffs beyond, the first sculptor, Neptune has carved grottoes and natural bridges, which richly reward a drive thither, although this natural curiosity does not equal the beauty of La Jolla on the San Diego shore.

    "Description":"At Palisade, the last place of interest passed before nightfall, some very picturesque scenery is enjoyed, the precipitous rocks on either side being sprinkled with a yellowish moss which resembles copper veining. At this point also a narrow-gauge road diverges to Eureka, where is located the richest gold mine in Nevada. We awake next morning in sight of that strange phenomenon, America's Dead Sea, skirting its borders until we approach Ogden, the terminus of four important railway systems, a city whose beautiful situation we did not have time to inspect as we turn aside here to visit the Mormon Saint's Rest—Salt Lake City. Perhaps no point in our long journey is regarded with a more curious interest than is the capital of Utah. Its strange history, its religion, built upon only nine commandments of the\nDecalogue, its long defiance of U. S. laws, with other unusual features increase one's natural desire to see this strange land. In our first drive about the city it was easy to decide that its beauty had been over-rated. We had heard of wide shaded streets with a gently purling river of pure water from the mountains, bordering every curb-stone. We found a swiftly-flowing muddy current in one gutter only of many of the streets, we found wide thoroughfares, it is true, but they were untidy, rough and ill-kept, and the sidewalks were in no cleanlier condition. The trees were almost wholly of the white locust species, which being now in full flower added a needed touch of grace and beauty to the city, which was also bathed in a clear radiant mountain atmosphere imparting a peculiar brilliancy to the\nsky. A perpetual inspiration is the Wasatch range of snowy peaks, which overlook the city and whose altitude of 13,000 feet it is difficult to realize, being ourselves now nearly 5000 feet above the level of the sea.",

It is a beautiful and thriving town, and with the advantages of both a natural and artificial navigation, is destined to become one of the most important places in the state. Its present population is estimated at upwards of 12,-000, and the number of buildings at rising of 2000. The Erie canal commences in this village, near the outlet of the Buffalo creek, and passes through an extensive and perfectly level plot, equidistant from the shore of the lake and the high grounds called the Terrace. From the canal are cut, at very suitable distances, lateral canals and basins, rendering the whole of the lower town contiguous to water communication. Stores and warehouses are so constructed as to receive the boats along side. In its location, Biiffalo is in the midst of the enterprize and business of this new world. All the manufactures and migrating population from the north and east here find a resting place, and the agricultural products of the west, coming from the long extended lakes, here seek a new avenue to the Atlantic, The lower town is rapidly spreading over that part below the Terrace, where begins a gentle and equal rise of ground, continuing nearly and perhaps quite two miles, and then falls away to a perfect level as far as the eye can reach, bounded only by the horizon. Upon this elevated ground there is a charming view of the lake, Niagara river, the canal with all its branches, the Buffalo creek, the town itself, and the Canada shore; a prospect from which every one parts with reluctance. The streets are very broad, and passing from high grounds over the Terrace to the water, are intersected with cross streets. There are three public squares of some extent, which add much to the beauty of the town. The public buildings are a court-house, situated on the highest part of Main-street, well proportioned and handsomely ornamented. The large park in front of it, which has been recently enclosed and set round with forest trees, will in a short time add much to the beauty of this part of the town.",

It stands on a dead level with the sea, two noble rivers, the Ashley and the Cooper, enclosing it on a wide peninsula called the Neck. Most of the houses contain a piazza, extending from the ground to the top, giving to the rooms in each story a shady open walk.

The soubriquet of the City of Brotherly Love, which it now bears, was given to it by Penn himself. This city lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, six miles above their junction; the site however is so low and level, that it does not make a very impressive appearance from any approach. But the elegance, symmetry, and neatness of its streets, and the picturesque character of the higher suburban land to the northward, fully compensate for this want. The streets of Philadelphia, which run north and south from the Schuylkill to the Delaware, are named after the trees, a row whereof grow on each side; but whether from a poetic spirit, or to aid the memory, some of the names are changed, that the following couplet, embracing the eight principal ones, may form a handy guide to the stranger or the resident...The United States Mint is situated in Philadelphia, and there is also a Navy Yard. Many of the bank edifices are very elegant, built of marble and other materials. Churches, Art Societies, and Literary and Scientific Institutions abound in Philadelphia. This city, like many others in America, is liberally supplied with water. Magnificient basins are built in a natural mound at Fairmount, about two miles distant; the water is forced up into these basins from the river by powerful water-wheels, worked by the said river, which is dammed up for the purpose of obtaining sufficient fall, as the stream is sometimes very low.",

One of the chief attractions in this city, is a very splendid Monument erected to the memory of Washington; it is built of pure white marble, is 196 feet in height inclusive of the basement, and is surmounted by a colossal statue of the “pater patriæ”; it is said to be the chief among the structures of the kind. In several respects Baltimore deserves the name of a fine city. It possesses many elegant public buildings; its streets are wide, long, and full of life and activity.",

    "Description":"Today I journeyed on by rail to Washington, the political capital of the United States. The principal object of attraction is the Capitol, which stands on a rising knoll, commanding an extensive panoramic view of the surrounding country. The building is on a grand scale, and faced with marble, which glittering in the sunbeams, gives it a very imposing appearance, which will be materially enhanced when the two wings are completed, the corner stone of which was laid in 1851. The Senate Chamber, and the Hall of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, are in the wings of the Capitol, on either side of the central building. The grand rotunda contains eight large pictures, illustrating scenes in American history, painted for the Government by native artists. The corner stone of this splendid structure was laid by Washington himself, Sept: 18th. 1793. The surrounding grounds, which are beautifully cultivated, and embellished by fountains and statuary, embrace from twenty five to thirty acres. The Presidents' Mansion is situated on a high terrace at the other extremity of the city, near which are the buildings of the Navy and War Departments, and also those of the State and Treasury Departments, the latter is a new and very imposing structure....The Capitol took much of my attention to day, and I was delighted with all\nthat I had the chance of seeing. Washington is delightfully situated on the banks of the Potomac River; the site of the city was chosen by Washington himself. The principal street is Pennsylvania Avenue, it is more than a mile in length, is very broad, and well planted\nwith trees.",

It is the largest capital of the Mississippi region, and with its population of over 200,000, is the fifth in extent and importance in all the Union. Its central position on the Ohio River has made it a receiving and distributing depot for all the wide and rich country tributary to those great waters. The streets in this great city are mostly of good width, well paved, and well lighted with gas. Main street, the great business highway, is five and a half miles long, and is intersected at right angles by fourteen leading streets, named First, Second, and so on. Amongst the principal buildings is the Observatory, which has a beautiful position upon Mount Adams, in the eastern part of the city. It commands an extensive view of the Ohio, and of the surrounding country. There are a great number of Churches, and Schools in the city, and also several Benevolent Institutions. Cincinnati is distinguished for the culture of the grape, and it is chiefly owing to the perseverance of Mr. Longworth, that they have been so far successful in producing wine. I learnt that about fifty thousand gallons is made per year. The wine is called “Catawba”, and is made both still and sparkling.",

    "Description":"After having passed through a lovely and romantic dell, you make a descent of about thirty feet, and then you perceive a sudden and very evident decrease in the temperature, and you find yourself all at once fairly within the precincts of this nether world. The temperature of the cave is uniformly the same, both in summer and winter, viz 59 deg. Fahrenheit, remarkably dry, and of extraordinary salubrity, and hence considered highly beneficial for invalids. A short distance from the entrance you pass the remains of numerous Saltpetre Vats, as in 1814 immense quantities of Saltpetre were manufactured in the Cave, and although the manufacture has been stopped some long time, yet the quantity of nitrous earth still remaining is enormous. The first object of interest is the “Great Vestibule”, this vast chamber has one single unsupported arch, covering an area of one and a half acres of ground. The lofty roof, a hundred feet above your head, becomes at length dimly seen; a glimpse is obtained of its enormous dome, with great groined arches and lofty buttresses formed of stalactitic rock. A little further on we come to “Audubon's Avenue”, which extends for about half a mile, but presents nothing of very special interest; we then pass through the main Cave for another half mile, when we reach the “Kentucky Cliff's”, so called from a fancied resemblance to the Cliffs on the Kentucky River: then making a descent of about forty feet, we enter the “Church”. This is a grand apartment, a hundred feet in diameter, with a roof formed of one solid seamless rock suspended seventy feet overhead. Religious services have been performed in the dim religious light of torches, under this magnificent roof. The “Gothic Avenue” is next reached, it is forty feet high and thirty wide, and is nearly two miles in length.",

    "Description":"St Louis lies upon the right bank af the Mississippi river; it is twelve hundred miles above the city of New Orleans. As early as 1764 St Louis was settled as a trading station for the trappers of the West; four years after it passed from the French into the hands of the Spaniards, who kept possession until it was transferred to the United States in 1804. The rapid increase of St Louis is almost as extraordinary as that of Cincinnati, and perhaps more so, when it is considered, not only that it is further west by hundreds of miles, but that it has to contend with the overflowing of the Mississippi, which has, on more than one occasion, risen to the first floor of the houses and stores built on the edge of the levee; fortunately, the greater part of the town, being built on higher ground, escapes the ruinous periodical inundations. In 1830 the population was under seven thousand, since which date the city has so rapidly increased, that in 1852 its population was bordering on 100,000. The natives of the United States form about one-half of the community, and those of Germany one-fourth; the remainder are chiefly Irish. The public edifices of St Louis, in its municipal buildings, churches, market-houses, and charitable institutions, are certainly creditable to the enterprise of the people. There are about forty churches, one fourth of which are Roman Catholic, many of them are very imposing. There are numerous manufacturing establishments in the city, amongst which flour-mills, and sugar refineries rank the foremost.",

    "Description":"Today I amused myself by seeing over Chicago. This is the largest and most important city in Illinois, and in its rapid growth, the most remarkable in the Union. In 1831 it was only an Indian trading post, and as late as 1840 its population did not number 5000, while in 1857 it scarcely fell short of 160,000. The city is on the southern shore of Lake Michigan; the site is an extremely level plain, stretching away for miles in beautiful and fertile prairies. It is divided into three portions by the two branches of the Chicago River, which unite within a mile of the lake. The Michigan and the Wabash Avenues—the one on the lake shore and the other next behind—are noble thoroughfares, in their extent, their architecture, and, more especially, in their fine lines of noble trees; I enjoyed a walk in the afternoon in these beautiful Avenues. The most striking of the public edifices are the Merchants' Exchange and the Court House; I ascended to the summit of the latter and was well repaid for the trouble by the beautiful view of the city and the surrounding country. While I was in Chicago great and ruinous competition was being carried on by the Railway Companies running between that city and New York, (a distance of nearly a thousand miles); tickets were to be had to convey passengers the aforesaid distance for 12 dollars, and this went on for a fortnight....Chicago boasts of numerous very fine buildings, many of the “Stores” rivalling in extent and build with those in New York. It is wonderful to think of the surprising growth of this Western City, and the next few years (by which time they will have completed the improvement in the streets) will doubtless effect still greater strides in this enterprising place.",

    "Description":"After the first feelings of mingled awe and delight were over, I began in some degree to realise the sublimity of the scene. What overcomes the visitor at first is the continual roar of the mass of mighty waters, it is perfectly deafening, but as soon as the ear becomes\naccustomed to it, they descend with a lulling and soothing sound. The noise of the Falls is sometimes heard at a very great distance, but of course it is constantly modified by the direction and strength of the wind. The great Lakes of North America—Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie—pour the flood of their accumulated waters into Lake Ontario, through a channel of about 36 miles in length. This channel is named the Niagara River, and is part of the boundary between Canada and the State of New York. Twenty two miles below its commencement at Lake Erie occur these celebrated Falls of Niagara. These Falls are divided into two by Goat Island. The Canadian or Horse-Shoe Fall is in reality Niagara itself, it is 2000 feet wide, and 160 feet high. The American Falls are 900 feet wide, and about 160 feet high, stupendous as they are, they must be considered no more than an offshoot from the main cataract. Over this magnificent precipice it is said the irresistible tide rushes at the rate of a hundred million tons of water every hour! Niagara, according to the testimony of all who dwell near it, is never more beautiful than in the cold midwinter, when no tourists visit it, and when the sides of the chasm are corrugated and adorned with pillars and stalactites of silvery frost; and when huge blocks of ice from Lake Erie, weighing hundreds of tons, are hurled down the Rapids and over the Falls, as if they were of no greater specific gravity than feathers or human bodies, and reappear half a mile lower down the river, shivered to numberless fragments. It is a tradition of Niagara that, in 1822 or 1823, such a thick wall of ice was formed above Goat Island that no water flowed past for several hours, and that in the interval the precipice at the Horse Shoe Fall was perfectly bare and dry. A picture of the scene, painted at the time, is still in existence.",

    "Description":"It is one of the most ancient cities on the North American Continent, having been founded in 1642. It contains a population of 75,000. It is not only a beautiful but a solidly-built city, and wears a general air and aspect of strength befitting the climate. By the French Roman Catholics, who form nearly one half of the population, it is called affectionately the Ville Marie, or town of the Virgin Mary; the names of its principal streets, derived from those of the Saints in the Romish Calendar, testify alike to the fervency and to the faith of its founders. The quays of Montreal are unsurpassed by those of any city in America; built of solid limestone, and uniting with the locks and cut stone wharves of the Lachine Canal, they display for several miles a mass of continuous masonry. Unlike the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi, no unsightly warehouses disfigure the river side. A broad terrace, faced with gray limestone, the parapets of which are surmounted with a substantial iron railing, divides the city from the river throughout its whole length. Amongst the public buildings, the most remarkable is the Roman Catholic Cathedral; of the vastness of the interior of this edifice, an idea may be formed from the fact that it is capable of accommodating nearly 12,000 persons. The view from the summit of its towers, one of which I ascended embracing the city and its suburbs, the river, and the surrounding country—is exceedingly beautiful. Other elegant public edifices claim the attention of the visitor, also numerous banks, nunneries, and churches: all of these buildings are erected in a most durable manner.",

    "Description":"Quebec is the capital of United Canada, and after Montreal, the most populous city in British North America; it is the quaintest and most remarkable city in the New World—picturesque as Edinburgh and strong as Gibraltar. Everybody who has seen or read of Quebec must remember the magnificent towering rock overhanging the river, on the summit of which the citadel is placed, forming at once the chief stronghold of its defence, and the grandest feature of its scenery. The city is divided into two sections, called the Upper and the Lower Towns; the Upper Town occupying the highest part of the promontory, which is surrounded by strong walls and other fortifications; and the Lower Town, being built around the base of Cape Diamond. The latter is the business quarter. I had not been many hours in Quebec before I stood at the wall of the citadel, overlooking the river from a dizzy height of 300 feet—the standard of Great Britain floating over my head; the red-coated soldiers of my native land pacing their rounds, and suggesting, by their general appearance, the dear old country, from which I was separated by so many thousand miles of ocean; and on the soil of whose noble colony I stood, and felt that I was no longer a “foreigner”, as I was sometimes reminded when in the United States. The Citadel with its numerous buildings covers about 40 acres; its impregnable position makes it perhaps the strongest fortresa on the American Continent. The view from the citadel is most lovely, taking in, as it does, the opposite banks of the great river for nearly 50 miles up and down. I heard it said, that a gentleman once remarked, that the only scene he knew more glorious than that which meets the eye from the citadel at Quebec was Rio Janeiro, which he believed to be by far the grandest in the world; but the Rio lacks the associations of Quebec. Who could forget that beneath its walls two chieftains, the bravest of the brave, fell on the same battle field.",

The coast there runs north and south, and the land encloses a huge bay with a strait. 47In this bay,136 we were told, were to be found many large cities of Christians and Moors, including one called Quambay [Cambay], as also six-hundred known islands, and within it the Red Sea and the “house” [Kaabah] of Mecca.\n \n On the following Sunday [April 29] we once more saw the North Star, which we had not seen for a long time.\n \n On Friday, the 18th of May,after having seen no land for twenty-three days, we sighted lofty mountains, and having all this time sailed before the wind we could not have made less than 600 leagues. The land, when first sighted, was at a distance of eight leagues, and our lead reached bottom at forty-five fathoms. That same night we took a course to the S.S.W., so as to get away from the coast. On the following day [May 19] we again approached the land, but owing to the heavy rain and a thunderstorm, which prevailed whilst we were sailing along the coast, our pilot was unable to identify the exact locality. On Sunday [May 20] we found ourselves close to some mountains, and when we were near enough for the pilot to recognise them he told us that they were above Calecut, and that this was the country we desired to go to.",

    "Description":"[A description of Calecut.] The city of Calecut is inhabited by Christians. They are of a tawny complexion. Some of them have big beards and long hair, whilst others clip their hair short or shave the head, merely allowing a tuft to remain on the crown as a sign that they are Christians. They also wear moustaches. They pierce the ears and wear much gold in them. They go naked down to the waist, covering their lower extremities with very fine cotton stuffs. But it is only the most respectable who do this, for the others manage as best they are able.\n \n [...]\n \n [Christian Church.] When we arrived [at Calecut] they took us to a large church, and this is what we saw:—\n \n The body of the church is as large as a monastery, all built of hewn stone and covered with tiles. At the main entrance rises a pillar of bronze as high as a mast, on the top of which was perched a bird, apparently a cock. In addition to this, there was another pillar as high as a man, and very stout. In the centre of the body of the church rose a chapel, all built of hewn stone, with a bronze door sufficiently wide for a man to pass, and stone steps leading up to it. Within this sanctuary stood a small image which they said represented Our Lady. Along the walls, by the main entrance, hung seven small bells. In this church the captain-major said his prayers, and we with him.\n \n We did not go within the chapel, for it is the custom that only certain servants of the church, called quafees,161 should enter. These quafees wore some threads passing over the left shoulder and under the right arm, in the same manner as our deacons wear the stole. They threw holy water over us, and gave us some white earth, which the Christians of this country are in the habit of putting on their foreheads, breasts, around the neck, and on the forearms. They threw holy water upon the captain-major and gave him some of the earth, which he gave in charge of someone, giving them to understand that he would put it on later.\n \n Many other saints were painted on the walls of the church, wearing crowns. They were painted variously, with teeth protruding an inch from the mouth, and four or five arms.\n \n Below this church there was a large masonry tank, similar to many others which we had seen along the road.\n \n [...]\n \n [Progress through the Town.] After we had left that place, and had arrived at the entrance to the city [of Calecut] we were shown another church, where we saw things like those described above. Here the crowd grew so dense that progress along the street became next to impossible, and for this reason they put the captain into a house, and us with him.\n \n The king sent a brother of the bale, who was a lord of this country, to accompany the captain, and he was attended by men beating drums, blowing anafils and bagpipes, and firing off matchlocks. In conducting the captain they showed us much respect, more than is shown in Spain to a king. The number of people was countless, for in addition to those who surrounded us, and among whom there were two thousand armed men, they crowded the roofs and houses.",

And when we arrived there, men of much distinction and great lords came out to meet the captain, and joined those who were already in attendance upon him. It was then an hour before sunset. When we reached the palace we passed through a gate into a courtyard of great size, and before we arrived at where the king was, we passed four doors, through which we had to force our way, giving many blows to the people. When, at last, we reached the door where the king was, there came forth from it a little old man, who holds a position resembling that of a bishop, and whose advice the king acts upon in all affairs of the church. This man embraced the captain when he entered the door. Several men were wounded at this door, and we only got in by the use of much force.\n \n [A Royal Audience, May 28.] The king was in a small court, reclining upon a couch covered with a cloth of green velvet, above which was a good mattress, and upon this again a sheet of cotton stuff, very white and fine, more so than any linen. The cushions were after the same fashion. In his left hand the king held a very large golden cup [spittoon], having a capacity of half an almude [8 pints]. At its mouth this cup was two palmas [16 inches] wide, and apparently it was massive. Into this cup the king threw the husks of a certain herb which is chewed by the people of this country because of its soothing effects, and which they call atambor. On the right side of the king stood a basin of gold, so large that a man might just encircle it with his arms: this contained the herbs. There were likewise many silver jugs. The canopy above the couch was all gilt.",

The governor is entitled the Kehrpun, and is sent from Tibet. The houses of this country, hitherward from Matayan, were all in a ruinous and deserted condition, a number of persons having been carried off the year before by a party of people called Dardi, an independent mountain tribe, three or four marches north from Diras, who speak the Pushtu as well as the Daradi language: their religion is not known. It is said to be a journey of ten stages to Badakhshan from Kashmir, through the country of the Dardis. The invaders were about 300, and they carried off 250 persons. The prisoners they make in these predatory incursions they sell as slaves. After this transaction a party of matchlock men were stationed at Diras, by order of the ruler of Kashmir, under the son of Málik Ahkárn, who holds half the revenue of the country from Matayan to Diras, in jagir from the Raja of Tibet.",

Rice and jawar, and chenna are never sown. From Matayan to Lé the water is bad, and engenders asthma and goitre ; the latter in Hindi is called Gilher: it does not seem prevalent, however, in the town of Lé; but shortness of breath, caused by the water, is very general.

It is governed by a Hakim, nominated by the Amir of Kokan: the road leading to it is level and good, and the Kirghizes, whose tents occur, are dependent upon this government. From Kashghar to Kurghasham they are dependant on the former place; that is, they carry their fuel, charcoal, and other things, to Kashghar for sale. They\n are privileged to have free transit, and require no passport, but come\n and go at pleasure : they are subject to China. Those from Kurghasham to Osh are the subjects of the Amir of Kokan: they possess extensive herds of cattle and horses. In the time of Narbuta Be\n they obstructed the road, but they were compelled by (his son)\n Alem Khan to leave it free to travellers. Osh is celebrated by the\n name of Takhti Suliman, and the tomb of Asef Barkhia, the vizir of\n Suliman, is still shown here: it is of great size. The throne of\n Suliman is on a small hill west from Osh, surmounted by a building\n with a dome. In the spring great numbers of people repair hither\n in pilgrimage to the tomb from all the surrounding countries,\n bringing with them articles of various descriptions for sale and\n barter. A bazaar is held in Osh every Tuesday. In the warm\n season the place swarms with mosquitoes, and the people construct\n a tall frame of four long posts in the centre of their houses, and\n sleep on the top of it. Nimangan is the name of a city two stages\n from Osh, west north-west, the fruit of which is very famous.",

It is a large city, without a wall; from the time of Narbuta Be it has become populous-beyond it there are not many more stations; it has a number of canals supplying every house. Amer Khan is the present ruler-two years ago, or in the beginning of A. H. 1228, it was subject to Alem Khan, his elder brother; but, in consequence of his tyrannical conduct, he became the object of universal detestation, and upon his march to Tashkend, the whole army mutinied, and, deserting him, raised the younger brother to the sovereignty of Kokan. After a short time, Alem Khan returned to Kokan to recover his authority, but lost his life in the attempt.\n \n Alem Khan and Amer Khan were both sons of Narbuta Be. The Amir of Kokan maintains a force of ten thousand horse, and pays them by grants of villages and lands; they cannot keep the field above two months at a time, as they carry with them provision for no longer a period. The other troops, raised by the tribes, amount to thirty thousand ; but they only engage to serve one month at a time, and that only once a year. Their services are not paid by the Amir. The people subject to the Government of Kokan are of the Kirghiz, Turk, Kapcbak, Ming, and Kazzak races. The troops are mostly armed with spears--some carry matchlocks. The chief cities belonging to the Amir are Osh, Namangan, Kasán, Chus, one stage from Namangan, Andejan, Marghinan, Kánbadám, Ashferek, Khojend. All these, except Chus and Namangan, are to the left of the Sir, the same river as the Sihun. Namangan and Chus and the hill country of Indejan are on the right of the river: the latter is rich in verdure and abounds with fruit. The forts of Turkestan are Sharukhiah, Tashkend, and Siram.\n \n [Text goes on for another page with some description of country.]",

    "Description":"The city of Samarkand, two hours, west by south; a celebrated city, and the seat of the sepulchre of Amir Timur ; a lofty building with an immense cupola : within it is a remarkable slab of a brilliant green stone, and above it is a plate with an inscription, with the name of Timur engraved on it. Formerly the dome was gilt, but Shah Murad Be stripped off the gilding, and took it away; it is now merely of stucco. The attendants are in much poverty; they told me that formerly they were supported by an allowance from the Emperors of Hindustan, which ceased with Mohammed Shah ; and they wished to know if there were in India any of the descendants of Timur, whom they might apprise of their condition. The observatory of Mirza Ulugh Beg was formerly here, but it was demolished by Shaiban Khan, and there is only a mound of rubbish left.\n \n The tombs of Khojeh Abdullah Ahrar, of Abul Mansur Maturidi, of the author of the Bedaya, and other eminent and illustrious men are also to be seen here.\n \n Samarkand is defended by a mud wall, as well as a citadel of earth. The interior of the fort is inhabited, as well as the suburb; in the centre of the city is a large hexagonal building, surmounted by a cupola, and in each angle is a market. There are many large colleges in the city; the largest is the Madressa Khanum, but it is now in ruins. Some of the colleges are still maintained, as those of Shirnak and Tilakari, founded by Baling tosh Beg; the principal of the Shir nak college is named Abu Sayid; he is the chief cazy also, and is one of the most learned and amiable men in Samarkand. The Tilakari college has two principals and two scholars. Opposite to the Shir nak college is that of Ulugh Beg, in which is the chamber of Mullah Jami.\n \n The Governor of Samarkand is Dowlet Be Kushbegi. Before\n the reign of Shah Murad Be, Samarkand was in an entirely dilapidated condition, and the colleges were haunted by lions and wolves. Shah Murad by great exertion repeopled the city, and it increases daily in population. There are two markets a week, on Sunday and Thursday. Horses of the Bokhara breed are cheap. The situation and climate of this city are delightful, and running streams supply it with water. A variety of tribes are to be met with in the neighbourhood, as Mohammedans from China, and Kapchaks, and Karakalpaks; formerly, perhaps, they were scattered in different cities, but they are now collected, and are all called Usbeks. The weight of Samarkand is, one tila, equal to one miskal, but the market miskal is equal to five tilas ; five bazar miskals are one gharribek, two gharribek make one pashezek, two pashezeks one yetimék, two yetiméks one nimkhora, two nimkhoras are one nim charek, two nimchareks one charek, four chareks one seer, sixteen seers one maund. Weights were formerly differently reckoned, but they have been fixed\n at these rates during the last two years.",

    "Description":"The city Bokhara, two hours west. Bokhara is surrounded by a mud wall, and contains a citadel within which the king resides. The city abounds with squares and markets, and the suburbs with gardens. The inhabitants of Bokhara are natives of Iran, and Rüm, and Nogais from Russia, and people from Kabul, and Peshawer, attracted thither by the good government of Mir Hyder and the perfect security of travelling. There are many colleges and students. Each college has endowments in land; besides which the king gives personal allowances to the teachers and disciples, out of the Máli Zikat, (or tax levied for charitable purposes) the rest of which is invariably distributed amongst the needy and distressed, and never goes into the royal coffers. All the affairs of the state are conducted by the king himself, without the assistance of any principal ministers, except Hakim Be, who when the king goes out from the city on any journey, is left in charge of the citadel and the administration of affairs. The collection of the Máli Zikat, and other imposts, is in the hands of Hakim Be also, under supervisal of the king: no other officer of the state has equal authority.\n \n There is a market for horses four days in each week. On Saturday, Monday, and Thursday, it is held in the city, on the side of the gate of the desert near the citadel: on Wednesday, it occurs without the city near the tomb of Baha-ud-din. Horses of no value only are brought to market, their price is from ten to fifteen tilas: horses of higher cost, or from 100 to 150 tilas, are to be had of the dealers at their own houses, and are brought by brokers for inspection: but there are very few, and it would be difficult at any one time to collect from fifty to one hundred horses of this class.\n \n [The text goes on for several paragraphs about horses and camels before moving toward politics. There is some interest in connections with Russia.]\n \n The tombs of Bokhara, either in the city or in its neighbourhood, are very numerous: amongst them are those of Hezret Said Amir Kulal, Khajeh Beha-ud-din of Nakshebend, Imam Abu Hefs Kabir, and Imam Ahmed Ghazali, of the author of the Shereh Wakaya, of Baba Paradoz (the darner) of Hezret Imlah and of Shah Murad Be Wali Niami; this last has no dome nor turrets: they say that the earth from this last tomb has many healing\n qualities.\n \n [Text about some of the surrounding territory.]\n \n The houses of Bokhara are like those of Peshawer; they are built of unbaked bricks, and are two or three stories high; the walls are thin and are strengthened with wooden buttresses: the markets are mostly covered in, and there are several Serais for the accommodationn of merchants, as the serai of Alem Khan, where the Hindus from Shikarpur and other places alight. The hire of a chamber is one tila per month: the Hindu traders pay also the jezia to the king. They bring indigo chiefly, and tobacco. Another serai is the Nogha-i, where the Nogay and other traders put up: the Nogays are Musselmans subject to Russia, some of them are residents in Bokhara. There are about fifty druggists' shops in the city; but no skilful physician-the practitioners are all ignorant of the science; and when any medical professor comes along with the merchants from Peshawer or other places, he is held in very high estimation. The most common disease is the rishteh, (Guinea worm) and few people are free from it, like colds in Hindustan in the winter season; the people of Bokhara are very dexterous in the treatment of it, and extract it by incision, in this manner : if the head of the rishteh be near the wrist and the tail near the elbow, they carry the finger along it, to ascertain its course, and then lay the skin open with a lancet for three or four fingers breadth, a little below the head, which they draw back to the place where the incision began; they then make another incision of a similar kind, and so proceed gradually till they come to the origin of the worm, and remove it entirely. Other complaints are fevers, leprosy, and affections of the bowels. It happens sometimes, that where the physicians have engaged to cure the sick, and the patient has died, the heirs have demanded the price of blood; in that case the king has declared that when the physician knows his profession, he shall be held\n acquitted; but if he proves an ignoramus he is condemned to pay\n the usual amercement--these cases are too frequent to be much\n attended to; but a physician leads but an uncomfortable sort of\n life in Bokhara.",

    "Description":"And in the good ship 'Atrato' I reached that emporium of travellers, St. Thomas, on the 2nd of December. We had awfully bad weather, of course, and the ship did wonders. When men write their travels, the weather has always been bad, and the ship has always done wonders. We thought ourselves very uncomfortable—I, for one, now know better—and abused the company, and the captain, and the purser, and the purveyor, and the stewards every day at breakfast and dinner; not always with the eloquence of the Frenchman and his walnut, but very frequently with quite equal energy. But at the end of our journey we were all smiles, and so was the captain. He was tender to the ladies and cordial to the gentlemen; and we, each in our kind, reciprocated his attention. On the whole, O my readers! if you are going to the West Indies, you may do worse than go in the 'Atrato.' But do not think too much of your withered apples.\n \n I landed at St. Thomas, where we lay for some hours; and as I put my foot on the tropical soil for the first time, a lady handed me a rose, saying, \"That's for love, dear.\" I took it, and said that it should be for love. She was beautifully, nay, elegantly dressed. Her broad-brimmed hat was as graceful as are those of Ryde or Brighton. The well-starched skirts of her muslin dress gave to her upright figure that look of easily compressible bulk, which, let 'Punch' do what it will, has become so sightly to our eyes. Pink gloves were on her hands. \"That's for love, dear.\" Yes, it shall be for love; for thee and thine, if I can find that thou deservest it. What was it to me that she was as black as my boot, or that she had come to look after the ship's washing?\n \n I shall probably have a word or two to say about St. Thomas; but not now. It is a Niggery-Hispano-Dano-Yankee-Doodle place; in which, perhaps, the Yankee-Doodle element, declaring itself in nasal twang and sherry cobblers, seems to be of the strongest flavour; as undoubtedly will be the case in many of these parts as years go on revolving. That nasal twang will sound as the Bocca Romana in coming fashionable western circles; those sherry cobblers will be the Falernian drink of a people masters of half the world. I dined at the hotel, but should have got a better dinner on board the 'Atrato,' in spite of the withered apples.",

    "Description":"From St. Thomas we went to Kingston, Jamaica, in the 'Derwent.' We were now separated from the large host of Spaniards who had come with us, going to Peru, the Spanish Main, Mexico, Cuba, or Porto Rico; and, to tell the truth, we were not broken-hearted on the occasion.\n \n [...]\n \n Kingston harbour is a large lagune, formed by a long narrow bank of sand which runs out into the sea, commencing some three or four miles above the town of Kingston, and continuing parallel with the coast on which Kingston is built till it reaches a point some five or six miles below Kingston. This sandbank is called \"The Palisades,\" and the point or end of it is Port Royal. This is the seat of naval supremacy for Jamaica, and, as far as England is concerned, for the surrounding islands and territories. And here lies our flag-ship; and here we maintain a commodore, a dock-yard, a naval hospital, a pile of invalided anchors, and all the usual adjuncts of such an establishment. Some years ago—I am not good at dates, but say seventy, if you will—Port Royal was destroyed by an earthquake.\n \n Those who are geographically inclined should be made to understand that the communication between Port Royal and Kingston, as, indeed, between Port Royal and any other part of the island, is by water. It is, I believe, on record that hardy Subs, and hardier Mids, have ridden along the Palisades, and not died from sun-stroke in the effort. But the chances are much against them. The ordinary ingress and egress is by water. The ferry boats usually take about an hour, and the charge is a shilling. The writer of these pages, however, has been two hours and a quarter in the transit.",

    "Description":"Were it arranged by Fate that my future residence should be in Jamaica, I should certainly prefer the life of a country mouse. The town mice, in my mind, have but a bad time of it. Of all towns that I ever saw, Kingston is perhaps, on the whole, the least alluring, and is the more absolutely without any point of attraction for the stranger than any other.\n \n It is built down close to the sea—or rather, on the lagune which forms the harbour, has a southern aspect, and is hot even in winter. I have seen the thermometer considerably above eighty in the shade in December, and the mornings are peculiarly hot, so that there is no time at which exercise can be taken with comfort. At about 10 a.m., a sea breeze springs up, which makes it somewhat cooler than it is two hours earlier—that is, cooler in the houses. The sea breeze, however, is not of a nature to soften the heat of the sun, or to make it even safe to walk far at that hour. Then, in the evening, there is no twilight, and when the sun is down it is dark. The stranger will not find it agreeable to walk much about Kingston in the dark.\n \n Indeed, the residents in the town, and in the neighbourhood of the town, never walk. Men, even young men, whose homes are some mile or half-mile distant from their offices, ride or drive to their work as systematically as a man who lives at Watford takes the railway.\n \n Kingston, on a map—for there is a map even of Kingston—looks admirably well. The streets all run in parallels. There is a fine large square, plenty of public buildings, and almost a plethora of places of worship. Everything is named with propriety, and there could be no nicer town anywhere. But this word of promise to the ear is strangely broken when the performance is brought to the test. More than half the streets are not filled with houses. Those which are so filled, and those which are not, have an equally rugged, disreputable, and bankrupt appearance. The houses are mostly of wood, and are unpainted, disjointed, and going to ruin. Those which are built with brick not unfrequently appear as though the mortar had been diligently picked out from the interstices.\n \n But the disgrace of Jamaica is the causeway of the streets themselves. There never was so odious a place in which to move. There is no pathway or trottoir to the streets, though there is very generally some such—I cannot call it accommodation—before each individual house. But as these are all broken from each other by steps up and down, as they are of different levels, and sometimes terminate abruptly without any steps, they cannot be used by the public. One is driven, therefore, into the middle of the street. But the street is neither paved nor macadamized, nor prepared for traffic in any way. In dry weather it is a bed of sand, and in wet weather it is a watercourse. Down the middle of this the unfortunate pedestrian has to wade, with a tropical sun on his head; and this he must do in a town which, from its position, is hotter than almost any other in the West Indies. It is no wonder that there should be but little walking.\n \n But the stranger does not find himself naturally in possession of a horse and carriage. He may have a saddle-horse for eight shillings; but that is expensive as well as dilatory if he merely wishes to call at the post-office, or buy a pair of gloves. There are articles which they call omnibuses, and which ply cheap enough, and carry men to any part of the town for sixpence; that is, they will do so if you can find them. They do not run from any given point to any other, but meander about through the slush and sand, and are as difficult to catch as the musquitoes.",

    "Description":"That which tends in part to the desolation of Kingston—or rather, to put the proposition in a juster form, which prevents Kingston from enjoying those advantages which would naturally attach to the metropolis of the island—is this: the seat of government is not there, but at Spanish Town. Then our naval establishment is at Port Royal.\n \n [...]\n \n New York, probably, might be no whit improved were the National Congress to be held there; nor Amsterdam, perhaps, if the Hague were abandoned; but it would be a great thing for Kingston if Spanish Town were deserted.\n \n The Governor lives at the latter place, as do also those satellites or moons who revolve round the larger luminary—the secretaries, namely, and executive officers. These in Jamaica are now so reduced in size that they could not perhaps do much for any city; but they would do a little, and to Kingston any little would be acceptable. Then the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly sit at Spanish Town, and the members—at any rate of the latter body—are obliged to live there during some three months of the year, not generally in very comfortable lodgings.\n \n Respectable residents in the island, who would pay some attention to the Governor if he lived at the principal town, find it impossible to undergo the nuisance of visiting Spanish Town, and in this way go neither to the one nor the other, unless when passing through Kingston on their biennial or triennial visits to the old country.\n \n And those visits to Spanish Town are indeed a nuisance. In saying this, I reflect in no way on the Governor or the Governor's people. Were Gabriel Governor of Jamaica, with only five thousand pounds a year, and had he a dozen angels with him as secretaries and aides-de-camp, mortal men would not go to them at Spanish Town after they had once seen of what feathers their wings were made.\n \n It is like the city of the dead. There are long streets there in which no human inhabitant is ever seen. In others a silent old negro woman may be sitting at an open door, or a child playing, solitary, in the dust. The Governor's house—King's House as it is called—stands on one side of a square; opposite is the house of the Assembly; on the left, as you come out from the Governor's, are the executive offices and house of the Council, and on the right some other public buildings. The place would have some pretension about it did it not seem to be stricken with an eternal death. All the walls are of a dismal dirty yellow, and a stranger cannot but think that the colour is owing to the dreadfully prevailing disease of the country. In this square there are no sounds; men and women never frequent it; nothing enters it but sunbeams—and such sunbeams! The glare from those walls seems to forbid that men and women should come there.\n \n The parched, dusty, deserted streets are all hot and perfectly without shade. The crafty Italians have built their narrow streets so that the sun can hardly enter them, except when he is in the mid heaven; but there has been no such craft at Spanish Town. The houses are very low, and when there is any sun in the heavens it can enter those streets; and in those heavens there is always a burning, broiling sun.\n \n But the place is not wholly deserted. There is here the most frightfully hideous race of pigs that ever made a man ashamed to own himself a bacon-eating biped. I have never done much in pigs myself, but I believe that pigly grace consists in plumpness and comparative shortness—in shortness, above all, of the face and nose. The Spanish Town pigs are never plump. They are the very ghosts of swine, consisting entirely of bones and bristles. Their backs are long, their ribs are long, their legs are long, but, above all, their heads and noses are hideously long. These brutes prowl about in the sun, and glare at the unfrequent strangers with their starved eyes, as though doubting themselves whether, by some little exertion, they might not become beasts of prey.\n \n The necessity which exists for white men going to Spanish Town to see the Governor results, I do not doubt, in some deaths every year. I will describe the first time I was thus punished. Spanish Town is thirteen miles from Kingston, and the journey is accomplished by railway in somewhat under an hour. The trains run about every four hours. On my arrival a public vehicle took me from the station up to King's House, and everything seemed to be very convenient. The streets, certainly, were rather dead, and the place hot; but I was under cover, and the desolation did not seem to affect me. When I was landed on the steps of the government-house, the first idea of my coming sorrows flitted across my mind. \"Where shall I call for you?\" said the driver; \"the train goes at a quarter past four.\" It was then one: and where was he to call for me? and what was I to do with myself for three hours? \"Here,\" I said; \"on these steps.\" What other place could I name? I knew no other place in Spanish Town.\n \n [...]",

    "Description":"I have spoken in disparaging terms of the chief town in Jamaica, but I can atone for this by speaking in very high terms of the country. In that island one would certainly prefer the life of the country mouse. There is scenery in Jamaica which almost equals that of Switzerland and the Tyrol; and there is also, which is more essential, a temperature among the mountains in which a European can live comfortably.\n \n I travelled over the greater part of the island, and was very much pleased with it. The drawbacks on such a tour are the expensiveness of locomotion, the want of hotels, and the badness of the roads. As to cost, the tourist always consoles himself by reflecting that he is going to take the expensive journey once, and once only. The badness of the roads forms an additional excitement; and the want of hotels is cured, as it probably has been caused, by the hospitality of the gentry.\n \n [...]\n \n It is of course known that the sugar-cane is the chief production of Jamaica; but one may travel for days in the island and only see a cane piece here and there. By far the greater portion of the island is covered with wild wood and jungle—what is there called bush. Through this, on an occasional favourable spot, and very frequently on the roadsides, one sees the gardens or provision-grounds of the negroes. These are spots of land cultivated by them, for which they either pay rent, or on which, as is quite as common, they have squatted without payment of any rent.\n \n These provision-grounds are very picturesque. They are not filled, as a peasant's garden in England or in Ireland is filled, with potatoes and cabbages, or other vegetables similarly uninteresting in their growth; but contain cocoa-trees, breadfruit-trees, oranges, mangoes, limes, plantains, jack fruit, sour-sop, avocado pears, and a score of others, all of which are luxuriant trees, some of considerable size, and all of them of great beauty. The breadfruit-tree and the mango are especially lovely, and I know nothing prettier than a grove of oranges in Jamaica. In addition to this, they always have the yam, which is with the negro somewhat as the potato is with the Irishman; only that the Irishman has nothing else, whereas the negro generally has either fish or meat, and has also a score of other fruits besides the yam.\n \n The yam, too, is picturesque in its growth. As with the potato, the root alone is eaten, but the upper part is fostered and cared for as a creeper, so that the ground may be unencumbered by its thick tendrils. Support is provided for it as for grapes or peas. Then one sees also in these provision-grounds patches of coffee and arrowroot, and occasionally also patches of sugar-cane.",

The former may be best done on horseback, as the roads are, one may say, non-existent for a considerable portion of the way, and sometimes almost worse than non-existent in other places.\n \n One of the most remarkable characteristics of Jamaica is the copiousness of its rivers. It is said that its original name, Xaymaca, signifies a country of streams; and it certainly is not undeserved. This copiousness, though it adds to the beauty, as no doubt it does also to its salubrity and fertility, adds something too to the difficulty of locomotion. Bridges have not been built, or, sad to say, have been allowed to go to destruction. One hears that this river or that river is \"down,\" whereby it is signified that the waters are swollen; and some of the rivers when so down are certainly not easy of passage. Such impediments are more frequent in the east than elsewhere, and on this account travelling on horseback is the safest as well as the most expeditious means of transit. I found four horses to be necessary, one for the groom, one for my clothes, and two for myself. A lighter weight might have done with three.",

It was once a military station, and the empty barracks, standing so beautifully over the sea, on an extreme point of land, are now waiting till time shall reduce them to ruin. The place is utterly desolate, though not yet broken up in its desolation, as such buildings quickly become when left wholly untenanted. A rusty cannon or two still stand at the embrasures, watching the entrance to the fort; and among the grass we found a few metal balls, the last remains of the last ordnance supplies.\n \n But Port Antonio was once a goodly town, and the country round it, the parish of Portland, is as fertile as any in the island. But now there is hardly a sugar estate in the whole parish. It is given up to the growth of yams, cocoas, and plantains. It has become a provision-ground for negroes, and the palmy days of the town are of course gone.\n \n [...]\n \n I had another adventure at Port Antonio. About two o'clock in the morning there was an earthquake, and we were all nearly shaken out of our beds. Some one rushed into my room, declaring that not a stone would be left standing of Port Royal. There were two distinct blows, separated by some seconds, and a loud noise was heard. I cannot say that I was frightened, as I had not time to realize the fact of the earthquake before it was all over. No harm was done, I believe, anywhere, beyond the disseverance of a little plaster from the walls.",

The road goes through Spanish Town, and then divides itself, one road going westward by the northern coast, and the other by that to the south. I went by the former, and began my journey by the bog or bogue walk, a road through a magnificent ravine, and then over Mount Diabolo.

Of a delicious mountain tarn he makes his punch-bowl; he loves to leap from crag to crag over the wildest ravines; he builds picturesque bridges in most impassable sites; and makes roads over mountains at gradients not to be attempted by the wildest engineer.

I never saw grass to equal the guinea grass in some of the parishes; and at Knockalva I looked at Hereford cattle which I have rarely, if ever, seen beaten at any agricultural show in England. At present the island does not altogether supply itself with meat; but it might do so, and supply, moreover, nearly the whole of the remaining West Indies. Proprietors of land say that the sea transit is too costly. Of course it is at present; the trade not yet existing; for indeed, at present there is no means of such transit. But screw steamers now always appear quickly enough wherever freight offers itself; and if the cattle were there, they would soon find their way down to the Windward Islands.",

    "Description":"I took a third expedition up to Newcastle, where are placed the barracks for our white troops, to the Blue Mountain peak, and to various gentlemen's houses in these localities. For grandeur of scenery this is the finest part of the island. The mountains are far too abrupt, and the land too much broken for those lovely park-like landscapes of which the parishes of Westmoreland and Hanover are full, and of which Stuttlestone, the property of Lord Howard de Walden, is perhaps the most beautiful specimen. But nothing can be grander, either in colour or grouping, than the ravines of the Blue Mountain ranges of hills. Perhaps the finest view in the island is from Raymond Lodge, a house high up among the mountains, in which—so local rumour says—'Tom Cringle's Log' was written.\n \n [...]\n \n I have hunted in Carmarthenshire, and a man who has done that ought to be able to ride anywhere; but in riding over some of these razorback crags, my heart, though it did not faint visibly, did almost do so invisibly. However, we got safely to Newcastle, and our fair friends returned over the same route with no other escort than that of a black groom. In spite of the crags the ride was not unpleasant.\n \n One would almost enlist as a full private in one of her Majesty's regiments of the line if one were sure of being quartered for ever at Newcastle—at Newcastle, Jamaica, I mean. Other Newcastles of which I wot have by no means equal attraction. This place also is accessible only by foot or on horseback; and is therefore singularly situated for a barrack. But yet it consists now of a goodly village, in which live colonels, and majors, and chaplains, and surgeons, and purveyors, all in a state of bliss—as it were in a second Eden. It is a military paradise, in which war is spoken of, and dinners and dancing abound. If good air and fine scenery be dear to the heart of the British soldier, he ought to be happy at Newcastle. Nevertheless, I prefer the views from Raymond Lodge to any that Newcastle can afford.",

To enable me to do this, I provided myself with a companion, and he provided me with five negroes, a supply of beef, bread, and water, some wine and brandy, and what appeared to me to be about ten gallons of rum; for we were to spend the night on the Blue Mountain Peak, in order that the rising sun might be rightly worshipped.\n \n For some considerable distance we rode, till we came indeed to the highest inhabited house in the island. This is the property of a coffee-planter who lives there, and who divides his time and energies between the growth of coffee and the entertainment of visitors to the mountain. So hospitable an old gentleman, or one so droll in speech, or singular in his mode of living, I shall probably never meet again. His tales as to the fate of other travellers made me tremble for what might some day be told of my own adventures. He feeds you gallantly, sends you on your way with a God-speed, and then hands you down to derision with the wickedest mockery. He is the gibing spirit of the mountain, and I would at any rate recommend no ladies to trust themselves to his courtesies.\n \n [...]\n \n I have nothing remarkable to tell of the ascent. We soon got into a cloud, and never got out of it. But that is a matter of course. We were soon wet through up to our middles, but that is a matter of course also.

    "Description":"[Trigger warnings]\n \n Cien Fuegos is a small new town on the southern coast of Cuba, created by the sugar trade, and devoted, of course, to commerce. It is clean, prosperous, and quickly increasing. Its streets are lighted with gas, while those in the Havana still depend upon oil-lamps. It has its opera, its governor's house, its alaméda, its military and public hospital, its market-place, and railway station; and unless the engineers deceive themselves, it will in time have its well. It has also that institution which in the eyes of travellers ranks so much above all others, a good and clean inn.\n \n My first object after landing was to see a slave sugar estate. I had been told in Jamaica that to effect this required some little management; that the owners of the slaves were not usually willing to allow strangers to see them at work; and that the manufacture of sugar in Cuba was as a rule kept sacred from profane eyes. But I found no such difficulty. I made my request to an English merchant at Cien Fuegos, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the proprietor of an estate some fifteen miles from the town; and by their joint courtesy I saw all that I wished.\n \n On this property, which consisted altogether of eighteen hundred acres—the greater portion of which was not yet under cultivation—there were six hundred acres of cane pieces. The average year's produce was eighteen hundred hogsheads, or three hogsheads to the acre. The hogshead was intended to represent a ton of sugar when it reached the market, but judging from all that I could learn it usually fell short of it by more than a hundredweight. The value of such a hogshead at Cien Fuegos was about twenty-five pounds. There were one hundred and fifty negro men on the estate, the average cash value of each man being three hundred and fifty pounds; most of the men had their wives. In stating this it must not be supposed that either I or my informant insist much on the validity of their marriage ceremony; any such ceremony was probably of rare occurrence. During the crop time, at which period my visit was made, and which lasts generally from November till May, the negroes sleep during six hours out of the twenty-four, have two for their meals, and work for sixteen! No difference is made on Sunday. Their food is very plentiful, and of a good and strong description. They are sleek and fat and large, like well-preserved brewers' horses; and with reference to them, as also with reference to the brewers' horses, it has probably been ascertained what amount of work may be exacted so as to give the greatest profit. During the remainder of the year the labour of the negroes averages twelve hours a day, and one day of rest in the week is usually allowed to them.",

    "Description":"There is nothing attractive about the town of Havana; nothing whatever to my mind, if we except the harbour. The streets are narrow, dirty, and foul. In this respect there is certainly much difference between those within and without the wall. The latter are wider, more airy, and less vile. But even in them there is nothing to justify the praises with which the Havana is generally mentioned in the West Indies. It excels in population, size, and no doubt in wealth any other city there; but this does not imply a great eulogium. The three principal public buildings are the Opera House, the Cathedral, and the palace of the Captain-General. The former has been nearly knocked down by an explosion of gas, and is now closed. I believe it to be an admirable model for a second-rate house. The cathedral is as devoid of beauty, both externally and internally, as such an edifice can be made. To describe such a building would be an absurd waste of time and patience. We all know what is a large Roman Catholic church, built in the worst taste, and by a combination of the lowest attributes of Gothic and Latin architecture. The palace, having been built for a residence, does not appear so utterly vile, though it is the child of some similar father. It occupies one side of a public square or pláza, and from its position has a moderately-imposing effect. Of pictures in the Havana there are none of which mention should be made.",

    "Description":"But the glory of the Havana is the Paseo—the glory so called. This is the public drive and fashionable lounge of the town—the Hyde Park, the Bois de Boulogne, the Cascine, the Corso, the Alaméda. It is for their hour on the Paseo that the ladies dress themselves, and the gentlemen prepare their jewelry. It consists of a road running outside a portion of the wall, of the extent perhaps of half a mile, and ornamented with seats and avenues of trees, as are the boulevards at Paris. If it is to be compared with any other resort of the kind in the West Indies, it certainly must be owned there is nothing like it; but a European on first seeing it cannot understand why it is so eulogized. Indeed, it is probable that if he first goes thither alone, as was the case with me, he will pass over it, seeking for some other Paseo.\n \n But then the glory of the Paseo consists in its volantes. As one boasts that one has swum in a gondola, so will one boast of having sat in a volante. It is the pride of Cuban girls to appear on the Paseo in these carriages on the afternoons of holidays and Sundays; and there is certainly enough of the picturesque about the vehicle to make it worthy of some description. It is the most singular of carriages, and its construction is such as to give a flat contradiction to all an Englishman's preconceived notions respecting the power of horses.\n \n The volante is made to hold two sitters, though there is sometimes a low middle seat which affords accommodation to a third lady. We will commence the description from behind. There are two very huge wheels, rough, strong, high, thick, and of considerable weight. The axles generally are not capped, but the nave shines with coarse polished metal. Supported on the axletree, and swinging forward from it on springs, is the body of a cabriolet such as ordinary cabriolets used to be, with the seat, however, somewhat lower, and with much more room for the feet. The back of this is open, and generally a curtain hangs down over the open space. A metal bar, which is polished so as to look like silver, runs across the footboard and supports the feet. The body, it must be understood, swings forward from these high wheels, so that the whole of the weight, instead of being supported, hangs from it. Then there are a pair of shafts, which, counting from the back of the carriage to the front where they touch the horse at the saddle, are about fourteen feet in length. They do not go beyond the saddle, or the tug depending from the saddle in which they hang. From this immense length it comes to pass that there is a wide interval, exceeding six feet, between the carriage and the horse's tail; and it follows also, from the construction of the machine, that a large portion of the weight must rest on the horse's back.",

No Englishman omits to hear, as he enters the harbour, that these forts were taken by the English in Albemarle's time. Now, it seems to me, they might very easily be taken by any one who chose to spend on them the necessary amount of gunpowder. But then I know nothing about forts.",

Looking up the side of the hills one sees the sugar-canes apparently in cleanly order, and they have an air of substantial comfort. Of course the times are not so bright as in the fine old days previous to emancipation; but nevertheless matters have been on the mend, and people are again beginning to get along. On the journey from Nevis to Antigua, Montserrat is sighted, and a singular island-rock called the Redonda is seen very plainly. Montserrat, I am told, is not prospering so well as St. Kitts or Nevis.\n \n These islands are not so beautiful, not so greenly beautiful, as are those further south to which we shall soon come.

Antigua has its own bishop, whose diocese includes also such of the Virgin Islands as belong to us, and the adjacent islands of St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat.\n \n Neither is Antigua remarkable for its beauty. It is approached, however, by an excellent and picturesque harbour, called English Harbour, which in former days was much used by the British navy; indeed, I believe it was at one time the head-quarters of a naval station. Premising, in the first place, that I know very little about harbours, I would say that nothing could be more secure than that.

And here we are among the rich green wild beauties of these thrice beautiful Caribbean islands. The mountain grouping of both these islands is very fine, and the hills are covered up to their summits with growth of the greenest. At both these islands one is struck with the great superiority of the French West Indian towns to those which belong to us. That in Guadaloupe is called Basseterre, and the capital of Martinique is St. Pierre. These towns offer remarkable contrasts to Roseau and Port Castries, the chief towns in the adjacent English islands of Dominica and St. Lucia. At the French ports one is landed at excellently contrived little piers, with proper apparatus for lighting, and well-kept steps. The quays are shaded by trees, the streets are neat and in good order, and the shops show that ordinary trade is thriving. There are water conduits with clear streams through the towns, and every thing is ship-shape. I must tell a very different tale when I come to speak of Dominica and St. Lucia.\n \n [...]\n \n Dominica and St. Lucia export annually about 6,000 hogsheads of sugar each. Martinique exports about 60,000 hogsheads. Martinique is certainly rather larger than either of the other two, but size has little or nothing to do with it.

Speaking of St. Pierre, in Martinique, the author says: \"The streets are neat, regular, and cleanly. The houses are high, and have more the air of European houses than those of the English colonies. Some of the streets have an avenue of trees, which overshadow the footpath, and on either side are deep gutters, down which the water flows. There are five booksellers houses, and the fashions are well displayed in other shops. The French colonists, whether Creoles or French, consider the West Indies as their country. They cast no wistful looks towards France. They marry, educate, and build in and for the West Indies, and for the West Indies alone. In our colonies it is different. They are considered more as temporary lodging-places, to be deserted as soon as the occupiers have made money enough by molasses and sugar to return home.\"",

    "Description":"To my mind, Dominica, as seen from the sea, is by far the most picturesque of all these islands. Indeed, it would be difficult to beat it either in colour or grouping. It fills one with an ardent desire to be off and rambling among those green mountains—as if one could ramble through such wild, bush country, or ramble at all with the thermometer at 85. But when one has only to think of such things without any idea of doing them, neither the bushes nor the thermometer are considered.\n \n One is landed at Dominica on a beach. If the water be quiet, one gets out dryshod by means of a strong jump; if the surf be high, one wades through it; if it be very high, one is of course upset. The same things happen at Jacmel, in Hayti; but then Englishmen look on the Haytians as an uncivilized, barbarous race. Seeing that Dominica lies just between Martinique and Guadaloupe, the difference between the English beach and surf and the French piers is the more remarkable.\n \n And then, the perils of the surf being passed, one walks into the town of Roseau. It is impossible to conceive a more distressing sight. Every house is in a state of decadence. There are no shops that can properly be so called; the people wander about chattering, idle and listless; the streets are covered with thick, rank grass; there is no sign either of money made or of money making. Everything seems to speak of desolation, apathy, and ruin. There is nothing, even in Jamaica, so sad to look at as the town of Roseau.\n \n The greater part of the population are French in manner, religion, and language, and one would be so glad to attribute to that fact this wretched look of apathetic poverty—if it were only possible. But we cannot do that after visiting Martinique and Guadaloupe. It might be said that a French people will not thrive under British rule. But if so, what of Trinidad? This look of misery has been attributed to a great fire which occurred some eighty years since; but when due industry has been at work great fires have usually produced improved towns. Now eighty years have afforded ample time for such improvement if it were forthcoming. Alas! it would seem that it is not forthcoming.\n \n It must, however, be stated in fairness that Dominica produces more coffee than sugar, and that the coffee estates have latterly been the most thriving. Singularly enough, her best customer has been the neighbouring French island of Martinique, in which some disease has latterly attacked the coffee plants.",

    "Description":"We then reach St. Lucia, which is also very lovely as seen from the sea. This, too, is an island French in its language, manners, and religion; perhaps more entirely so than any other of the islands belonging to ourselves. The laws even are still French, and the people are, I believe, blessed (?) with no Lords and Commons. If I understand the matter rightly, St. Lucia is held as a colony or possession conquered from the French, and is governed, therefore, by a quasi-military governor, with the aid of a council. It is, however, in some measure dependent on the Governor of Barbados, who is again one of your supreme governors. There has, I believe, been some recent change which I do not pretend to understand. If these changes be not completed, and if it would not be presumptuous in me to offer a word of advice, I would say that in the present state of the island, with a Negro-Gallic population who do little or nothing, it might be as well to have as much as possible of the Queen, and as little as possible of the Lords and Commons.\n \n To the outward physical eye, St. Lucia is not so triste as Dominica. There is good landing there, and the little town of Castries, though anything but prosperous in itself, is prosperous in appearance as compared with Roseau.\n \n St. Lucia is peculiarly celebrated for its snakes. One cannot walk ten yards off the road—so one is told—without being bitten. And if one be bitten, death is certain—except by the interposition of a single individual of the island, who will cure the sufferer—for a consideration. Such, at least, is the report made on this matter. The first question one should ask on going there is as to the whereabouts and usual terms of that worthy and useful practitioner. There is, I believe, a great deal that is remarkable to attract the visitor among the mountains and valleys of St. Lucia.",

In settling this island, the chief difficulty the English had was with the old native Indians, who more than once endeavoured to turn out their British masters. The contest ended in their being effectually turned out by those British masters, who expelled them all bodily to the island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; where their descendants are now giving the Anglo-American diplomatists so much trouble in deciding whose subjects they truly are. May we not say that, having got rid of them out of St. Vincent, we can afford to get rid of them altogether?\n \n Kingston is the capital here. It looks much better than either Roseau or Castries, though by no means equal to Basseterre or St. Pierre.\n \n This island is said to be healthy, having in this respect a much better reputation than its neighbour St. Lucia, and as far as I could learn it is progressing—progressing slowly, but progressing—in spite even of the burden of Queens, Lords, and Commons. The Lords and Commons are no doubt considerably modified by official influence.",

    "YearOfTravel":1859,
    "Description":"When I settle out of England, and take to the colonies for good and all, British Guiana shall be the land of my adoption. If I call it Demerara perhaps I shall be better understood. At home there are prejudices against it I know. They say that it is a low, swampy, muddy strip of alluvial soil, infested with rattlesnakes, gallinippers, and musquitoes as big as turkey-cocks; that yellow fever rages there perennially; that the heat is unendurable; that society there is as stagnant as its waters; that men always die as soon as they reach it; and when they live are such wretched creatures that life is a misfortune. Calumny reports it to have been ruined by the abolition of slavery; milk of human kindness would forbid the further exportation of Europeans to this white man's grave; and philanthropy, for the good of mankind, would wish to have it drowned beneath its own rivers. There never was a land so ill spoken of—and never one that deserved it so little. All the above calumnies I contradict; and as I lived there for a fortnight—would it could have been a month!—I expect to be believed.\n \n [...]\n \n Guiana is an enormous extent of flat mud, the alluvial deposit of those mighty rivers which for so many years have been scraping together earth in those wild unknown upland countries, and bringing it down conveniently to the sea-board, so that the world might have sugar to its tea. I really think my friend was right. There is no limit to the fertility and extent of this region. The only limit is in labour. The present culture only skirts the sea-board and the riversides. You will hardly find an estate—I do not think that you can find one—that has not a water frontage. This land formerly belonged to the Dutch, and by them was divided out into portions which on a map have about them a Euclidical appearance. Let A B C D be a right-angled parallelogram, of which the sides A B and C D are three times the length of the other sides A C and B D. 'Tis thus you would describe a Demerara property, and the Q. E. D. would have reference to the relative quantities of sugar, molasses, and rum producible therefrom.\n \n But these strips of land, though they are thus marked out on the maps with four exact lines, are presumed to run back to any extent that the owner may choose to occupy. He starts from the water, and is bounded on each side; but backwards! Backwards he may cultivate canes up to the very Andes, if only he could get Coolies. Oh, ye soft-hearted, philanthropic gentry of the Anti-Slavery Society, only think of that; a million hogsheads of sugar—and you like cheap sugar yourselves—if you will only be quiet, or talk on subjects that you understand!\n \n The whole of this extent of mud, beyond the present very limited sugar-growing limits, is covered by timber. One is apt to think of an American forest as being as magnificent in its individual trees as it is huge in its extent of surface. But I doubt much whether this is generally the case. There are forest giants no doubt; but indigenous primeval wood is, I take it, for the most part a disagreeable, scrubby, bushy, sloppy, unequal, inconvenient sort of affair, to walk through which a man should be either an alligator or a monkey, and to make much way he should have a touch of both. There be no forest glades there in which uncivilized Indian lovers walk at ease, with their arms round each other's naked waists; no soft grass beneath the well-trimmed trunk on which to lie and meditate poetical. But musquitoes abound there; and grass flies, which locate themselves beneath the toe-nails; and marabunters, a villanous species of wasp; and gallinippers, the grandfathers of musquitoes; and from thence up to the xagua and the boa constrictor all nature is against a cool comfortable ramble in the woods.",

    "Description":"If there be a deficiency in Georgetown—it is hardly necessary to explain that Georgetown is the capital of the province of Demerara, and that Demerara is the centre province in the colony of British Guiana; or that there are three provinces, Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo, so called from the names of the three great rivers of the country—But if there be a deficiency in Georgetown, it is in respect to cabs. The town is extensive, as will by-and-by be explained; and though I would not so far militate against the feelings of the people as to say that the weather is ever hot—I should be ungrateful as well as incredulous were I to do so—nevertheless, about noonday one's inclination for walking becomes subdued. Cabs would certainly be an addition to the luxuries of the place. But even these are not so essential as might at the first sight appear, for an invitation to dinner always includes an offer of the host's carriage. Without a carriage no one dreams of dragging on existence in British Guiana. In England one would as soon think of living in a house without a fireplace, or sleeping in a bed without a blanket.\n \n For those who wander abroad in quest of mountain scenery it must be admitted that this colony has not much attraction. The country certainly is flat. By this I mean to intimate, that go where you will, travel thereabouts as far as you may, the eye meets no rising ground. Everything stands on the same level. But then, what is the use of mountains? You can grow no sugar on them, even with ever so many Coolies. They are big, brown, valueless things, cumbering the face of the creation; very well for autumn idlers when they get to Switzerland, but utterly useless in a colony which has to count its prosperity by the number of its hogsheads. Jamaica has mountains, and look at Jamaica!\n \n [...]\n \n Georgetown to my eyes is a prepossessing city, flat as the country round it is, and deficient as it is—as are all the West Indies—in anything like architectural pretension. The streets are wide and airy. The houses, all built of wood, stand separately, each a little off the road; and though much has not been done in the way of their gardens—for till the great coming influx of Coolies all labour is engaged in making sugar—yet there is generally something green attached to each of them. Down the centre of every street runs a wide dyke. Of these dykes I must say something further when I come to speak again of the sugar doings; for their importance in these provinces cannot well be overrated.\n \n The houses themselves are generally without a hall. By that I mean that you walk directly into some sitting-room. This, indeed, is general through the West Indies; and now that I bethink me of the fact, I may mention that a friend of mine in Jamaica has no door whatsoever to his house. All ingress and egress is by the windows. My bedroom had no door, only a window that opened. The sitting-rooms in Georgetown open through to each other, so that the wind, let it come which way it will, may blow through the whole house. For though it is never absolutely hot in Guiana—as I have before mentioned—nevertheless, a current of air is comfortable. One soon learns to know the difference of windward and leeward when living in British Guiana.",

    "Description":"From Georgetown, Demerara, to New Amsterdam, Berbice, men travel either by steamer along the coast, or by a mail phaeton. The former goes once a week to Berbice and back, and the latter three times. I went by the mail phaeton and returned by the steamer. And here, considering the prosperity of the colony, the well-being and comfort of all men and women in it, the go-ahead principles of the place, and the coming million hogsheads of sugar—the millennium of a West Indian colony—considering all these great existing characteristics of Guiana, I must say that I think the Governor ought to look to the mail phaeton. It was a woful affair, crumbling to pieces along the road in the saddest manner; very heart-rending to the poor fellow who had to drive it, and body-rending to some of the five passengers who were tossed to and fro as every fresh fragment deserted the parent vehicle with a jerk. And then, when we had to send the axle to be mended, that staying in the road for two hours and a half among the musquitoes! Ohe! ohe! Ugh! ugh!\n \n It grieves me to mention this, seeing that rose colour was so clearly the prevailing tint in all matters belonging to Guiana. And I would have forgiven it had the phaeton simply broken down on the road. All sublunar phaetons are subject to such accidents. Why else should they have been named after him of the heavens who first suffered from such mishaps? But this phaeton had broken down before it commenced its journey. It started on a system of ropes, bandages, and patches which were disgraceful to such a colony and such a Governor; and I should intromit a clear duty, were I to allow it to escape the gibbet.\n \n But we did reach New Amsterdam not more than five hours after time. I have but very little to say of the road, except this: that there is ample scope for sugar and ample room for Coolies.",

At ten o'clock I found myself at the hotel, and pronounce it to be, without hesitation, the best inn, not only in that colony, but in any of these Western colonies belonging to Great Britain. It is kept by a negro, one Mr. Paris Brittain, of whom I was informed that he was once a slave. \"O, si sic omnes!\" But as regards my experience, he is merely the exception which proves the rule. I am glad, however, to say a good word for the energies and ambition of one of the race, and shall be glad if I can obtain for Mr. Paris Brittain an innkeeper's immortality.\n \n His deserts are so much the greater in that his scope for displaying them is so very limited. No man can walk along the broad strand street of New Amsterdam, and then up into its parallel street, so back towards the starting-point, and down again to the sea, without thinking of Knickerbocker and Rip van Winkle. The Dutchman who built New Amsterdam and made it once a thriving town must be still sleeping, as the New York Dutchman once slept, waiting the time when an irruption from Paramaribo and Surinam shall again restore the place to its old possessors.\n \n At present life certainly stagnates at New Amsterdam. Three persons in the street constitute a crowd, and five collected for any purpose would form a goodly club. But the place is clean and orderly, and the houses are good and in good repair. They stand, as do the houses in Georgetown, separately, each surrounded by its own garden or yard, and are built with reference to the wished-for breeze from the windows.",

    "Description":"[Trigger warnings.]\n \n Barbados is a very respectable little island, and it makes a great deal of sugar. It is not picturesquely beautiful, as are almost all the other Antilles, and therefore has but few attractions for strangers.\n \n But this very absence of scenic beauty has saved it from the fate of its neighbours. A country that is broken into landscapes, that boasts of its mountains, woods, and waterfalls, that is regarded for its wild loveliness, is seldom propitious to agriculture. A portion of the surface in all such regions defies the improving farmer. But, beyond this, such ground under the tropics offers every inducement to the negro squatter. In Jamaica, Dominica, St. Lucia, and Grenada, the negro, when emancipated, could squat and make himself happy; but in Barbados there was not an inch for him.\n \n [...]\n \n As to its appearance, it is, as I have said, totally different from any of the other islands, and to an English eye much less attractive in its character. But for the heat its appearance would not strike with any surprise an Englishman accustomed to an ordinary but ugly agricultural country. It has not the thick tropical foliage which is so abundant in the other islands, nor the wild, grassy dells. Happily for the Barbadians every inch of it will produce canes; and, to the credit of the Barbadians, every inch of it does so. A Barbadian has a right to be proud of this, but it does not make the island interesting. It is the waste land of the world that makes it picturesque. But there is not a rood of waste land in Barbados. It certainly is not the country for a gipsy immigration. Indeed, I doubt whether there is even room for a picnic.\n \n The island is something over twenty miles long, and something over twelve broad. The roads are excellent, but so white that they sadly hurt the eye of a stranger. The authorities have been very particular about their milestones, and the inhabitants talk much about their journeys. I found myself constantly being impressed with ideas of distance, till I was impelled to suggest a rather extended system of railroads—a proposition which was taken in very good part. I was informed that the population was larger than that of China, but my informant of course meant by the square foot. He could hardly have counted by the square mile in Barbados.\n \n And thus I was irresistibly made to think of the frog that would blow itself out and look as large as an ox.",

    "Description":"Bridgetown, the metropolis of the island, is much like a second or third rate English town. It has none of the general peculiarities of the West Indies, except the heat. The streets are narrow, irregular, and crooked, so that at first a stranger is apt to miss his way. They all, however, converge at Trafalgar Square, a spot which, in Barbados, is presumed to compete with the open space at Charing Cross bearing the same name. They have this resemblance, that each contains a statue of Nelson. The Barbadian Trafalgar Square contains also a tree, which is more than can be said for its namesake. It can make also this boast, that no attempt has been made within it which has failed so grievously as our picture gallery. In saying this, however, I speak of the building only—by no means of the pictures.\n \n There are good shops in Bridgetown—good, respectable, well-to-do shops, that sell everything, from a candle down to a coffin, including wedding-rings, corals, and widows' caps. But they are hot, fusty, crowded places, as are such places in third-rate English towns. But then the question of heat here is of such vital moment! A purchase of a pair of gloves in Barbados drives one at once into the ice-house.\n \n And here it may be well to explain this very peculiar, delightful, but too dangerous West Indian institution. By-the-by, I do not know that there was any ice-house in Kingston, Jamaica. If there be one there, my friends were peculiarly backward, for I certainly was not made acquainted with it. But everywhere else—at Demerara, Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Thomas—I was duly introduced to the ice-house.",

    "Description":"No scenery can be more picturesque than that afforded by the entrance to Port of Spain, the chief town in the island of Trinidad. Trinidad, as all men doubtless know, is the southernmost of the West Indian islands, and lies across the delta of the Orinoco river. The western portion of the island is so placed that it nearly reaches with two horns two different parts of the mainland of Venezuela, one of the South American republics. And thus a bay is formed closed in between the island and the mainland, somewhat as is the Gulf of Mexico by the island of Cuba; only that the proportions here are much less in size. This enclosed sea is called the Gulf of Paria.\n \n [...]\n \n On the mainland, that is the land of the main island, the coast is precipitous, but clothed to the very top with the thickest and most magnificent foliage. With an opera-glass one can distinctly see the trees coming forth from the sides of the rocks as though no soil were necessary for them, and not even a shelf of stone needed for their support And these are not shrubs, but forest trees, with grand spreading branches, huge trunks, and brilliant coloured foliage. The small island on the other side is almost equally wooded, but is less precipitous. Here, however, there are open glades, and grassy enclosures, which tempt one to wish that it was one's lot to lie there in the green shade and eat bananas and mangoes. This little island in the good old days, regretted by not a few, when planters were planters, and slaves were slaves, produced cotton up to its very hill-tops. Now I believe it yields nothing but the grass for a few cattle.\n \n Our steamer as she got well into the boca drew near to the shore of the large island, and as we passed along we had a succession of lovely scenes. Soft-green smiling nooks made themselves visible below the rocks, the very spots for picnics. One could not but long to be there with straw hats and crinoline, pigeon pies and champagne baskets. There was one narrow shady valley, into which a creek of the sea ran up, that must have been made for such purposes, either for that, or for the less noisy joys of some Paul of Trinidad with his Creole Virginia.\n \n As we steamed on a little further we came to a whaling establishment. Ideas of whaling establishments naturally connect themselves with icebergs and the North Pole. But it seems that there are races of whales as there are of men, proper to the tropics as well as to the poles; and some of the former here render up their oily tributes. From the look of the place I should not say that the trade was flourishing. The whaling huts are very picturesque, but do not say much for the commercial enterprise of the proprietors.\n \n [...]\n \n As my sojourn in Trinidad did not amount to two entire days, I do not feel myself qualified to give a detailed description of the whole island. Very few, I imagine, are so qualified, for much of it is unknown; there is a great want of roads, and a large proportion of it has, I believe, never been properly surveyed.",

That which is the larger, and the seat of government, is called the Port of Spain, and lies near to the northern horn. \n \n […]\n \n From them we went on through many smaller islands to Port of Spain. This is a large town, excellently well laid out, with the streets running all at right angles to each other, as is now so common in new towns. The spaces have been prepared for a much larger population than that now existing, so that it is at present straggling, unfilled, and full of gaps. But the time will come, and that before long, when it will be the best town in the British West Indies. There is at present in Port of Spain a degree of commercial enterprise quite unlike the sleepiness of Jamaica or the apathy of the smaller islands.\n \n [...]\n \n Immediately round Port of Spain the country is magnificent, and the views from the town itself are very lovely. Exactly behind the town, presuming the sea to be the front, is the Savanah, a large enclosed, park-like piece of common, the race-course and Hyde Park of Trinidad. I was told that the drive round it was three English miles in length; but if it be so much, the little pony which took me that drive in a hired buggy must have been a fast trotter.",

And then the necessary freedom from boredom, etiquette, and Governor's grandeur, so hated by Governors themselves, which must necessarily be brought about by such a residence! I could almost wish to be a Governor myself, if I might be allowed to live in such a cottage.",

In this I referred not only to the settlers, but to those also who are constantly passing through it. In the shops and stores, and at the hotels, one meets the same mixture. The Spanish element is of course strong, for Venezuela, New Granada, Central America, and Mexico are all Spanish, as also is Cuba. The people of these lands speak Spanish, and hereabouts are called Spaniards. To the Danes the island belongs. The soldiers, officials, and custom-house people are Danes. They do not, however, mix much with their customers. They affect, I believe, to say that the island is overrun and destroyed by these strange comers, and that they would as lief be without such visitors. If they are altogether indifferent to money making, such may be the case. The labouring people are all black—if these blacks can be called a labouring people. They do coal the vessels at about a dollar a day each—that is, when they are so circumstanced as to require a dollar. As to the American element, that is by no means the slightest or most retiring. Dollars are going there, and therefore it is of course natural that Americans should be going also. I saw the other day a map, \"The United States as they now are, and in prospective;\" and it included all these places—Mexico, Central America, Cuba, St. Domingo, and even poor Jamaica. It may be that the man who made the map understood the destiny of his country; at any rate, he understood the tastes of his countrymen.\n \n [...]\n \n But we must give even the devil his due. Seen from the water St. Thomas is very pretty. It is not so much the scenery of the island that pleases as the aspect of the town itself. It stands on three hills or mounts, with higher hills, green to their summit, rising behind them. Each mount is topped by a pleasant, cleanly edifice, and pretty-looking houses stretch down the sides to the water's edge. The buildings do look pretty and nice, and as though chance had arranged them for a picture. Indeed, as seen from the harbour, the town looks like a panorama exquisitely painted. The air is thin and transparent, and every line shows itself clearly. As so seen the town of St. Thomas is certainly attractive. But it is like the Dead Sea fruit; all the charm is gone when it is tasted. Land there, and the beauty vanishes.\n \n [...]\n \n A hot climate, it is generally thought, interferes with the appetite, affects the gastric juices with lassitude, gives to the stomach some of the apathy of the body, and lessens at any rate the consumption of animal food. That charge cannot be made against the air of St. Thomas. To whatever sudden changes the health may be subject, no lingering disinclination for food affects it. Men eat there as though it were the only solace of their life, and women also. Probably it is so.",

It is a deserted little country villa or chateau, called San Pedro, standing in a farm-yard, and now containing no other furniture than a marble bust of the Dictator, with a few wretchedly coloured French prints with cracked glass plates. The bust is not a bad one, and seems to have a solemn and sad meaning in its melancholy face, standing there in its solitary niche in the very room in which the would-be liberator died.\n \n For Bolivar had grand ideas of freedom, though doubtless he had grand ideas also of personal power and pre-eminence; as has been the case with most of those who have moved or professed to move in the vanguard of liberty. To free mankind from all injurious thraldom is the aspiration of such men; but who ever thought that obedience to himself was a thraldom that could be injurious?\n \n And here in this house, on the 17th December, 1830, Bolivar died, broken-hearted, owing his shelter to charity, and relieved in his last wants by the hands of strangers to his country. When the breath was out of him and he was well dead, so that on such a matter he himself could probably have no strong wish in any direction, they took away his body, of course with all honour, to the district that gave him birth, and that could afford to be proud of him now that he was dead;—into Venezuela and reburied him at Caracas. But dying poverty and funeral honours have been the fate of great men in other countries besides Columbia.",

    "Description":"I then went on to Cartagena. This is a much better town than Santa Martha, though even this is in its decadence. It was once a flourishing city, great in commerce and strong in war. It was taken by the English, not however without signal reverses on our part, and by the special valour—so the story goes—of certain sailors who dragged a single gun to the summit of a high abrupt hill called the \"Papa,\" which commands the town. If the thermometer stood in those days as high at Cartagena as it does now, pretty nearly through the whole of the year, those sailors ought to have had the Victoria cross. But these deeds were done long years ago, in the time of Drake and his followers; and Victoria crosses were then chiefly kept for the officers.\n \n The harbour at Cartagena is singularly circumstanced. There are two entrances to it, one some ten miles from the city and the other close to it. This nearer aperture was blocked up by the Spaniards, who sank ships across the mouth; and it has never been used or usable since. The present entrance is very strongly fortified. The fortifications are still there, bristling down to the water's edge; or they would bristle, were it not that all the guns have been sold for the value of the brass metal.\n \n Cartagena was hotter even than Santa Martha; but the place is by no means so desolate and death-like. The shops there are open to the streets, as shops are in other towns. Men and women may occasionally be seen about the square; and there is a trade,—in poultry if in nothing else.\n \n There is a cathedral here also, and I presume a bishop. The former is built after the Spanish fashion, and boasts a so-called handsome, large, marble pulpit. That it is large and marble, I confess; but I venture to question its claims to the other epithet. There are pictures also in the cathedral; of spirits in a state of torture certainly; and if I rightly remember of beatified spirits also. But in such pictures the agonies of the damned always excite more attention and a keener remembrance than the ecstasies of the blest. I cannot say that the artist had come up either to the spirit of Fra Angelico, or to the strength of Orcagna.",

    "Description":"From Cartagena I went on to the isthmus; the Isthmus of Panamá, as it is called by all the world, though the American town of Aspinwall will gradually become the name best known in connexion with the passage between the two oceans.\n \n This passage is now made by a railway which has been opened by an American company between the town of Aspinwall, or Colon, as it is called in England, and the city of Panamá. Colon is the local name for this place, which also bears the denomination of Navy Bay in the language of sailors. But our friends from Yankee-land like to carry things with a high hand, and to have a nomenclature of their own. Here, as their energy and their money and their habits are undoubtedly in the ascendant, they will probably be successful; and the place will be called Aspinwall in spite of the disgust of the New Granadians, and the propriety of the English, who choose to adhere to the names of the existing government of the country.\n \n A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and Colon or Aspinwall will be equally vile however you may call it. It is a wretched, unhealthy, miserably situated but thriving little American town, created by and for the railway and the passenger traffic which comes here both from Southampton and New York. That from New York is of course immensely the greatest, for this is at present the main route to San Francisco and California.\n \n I visited the place three times, for I passed over the isthmus on my way to Costa Rica, and on my return from that country I went again to Panamá, and of course back to Colon. I can say nothing in its favour. My only dealing there was with a washerwoman, and I wish I could place before my readers a picture of my linen in the condition in which it came back from that artist's hands. I confess that I sat down and shed bitter tears. In these localities there are but two luxuries of life, iced soda-water and clean shirts. And now I was debarred from any true enjoyment of the latter for more than a fortnight.",

    "Description":"Panamá has doubtless become a place of importance to Englishmen and Americans, and its name is very familiar to our ears. But nevertheless it is a place whose glory has passed away. It was a large Spanish town, strongly fortified, with some thirty thousand inhabitants. Now its fortifications are mostly gone, its churches are tumbling to the ground, its old houses have so tumbled, and its old Spanish population has vanished. It is still the chief city of a State, and a congress sits there. There is a governor and a judge, and there are elections; but were it not for the passengers of the isthmus there would soon be but little left of the city of Panamá.\n \n [... racism ...]\n \n There is a Spanish cathedral here also, in which I heard a very sweet-toned organ, and one magnificent tenor voice. The old church buildings still standing here are not without pretence, and are interesting from the dark tawny colour of the stone, if from no other cause. I should guess them to be some two centuries old. Their style in many respects resembles that which is so generally odious to an Englishman's eye and ear, under the title of Renaissance. It is probably an offshoot of that which is called Plateresque in the south of Spain.\n \n During the whole time that I was at Panamá the thermometer stood at something above ninety. In Calcutta I believe it is often as high as one hundred and ten, so that I have no right to speak of the extreme heat. But, nevertheless, Panamá is supposed to be one of the hottest places in the western world; and I was assured, while there, that weather so continuously hot for the twenty-four hours had not been known during the last nine years. The rainy season should have commenced by this time—the early part of May. But it had not done so; and it appeared that when the rain is late, that is the hottest period of the whole year.\n \n The heat made me uncomfortable, but never made me ill. I lost all pleasure in eating, and indeed in everything else. I used to feel a craving for my food, but no appetite when it came. I was lethargic, as though from repletion, when I did eat, and was always glad when my watch would allow me to go to bed. But yet I was never ill.",

I visited Toboga, in which are the head-quarters of the latter. Here I found a small English maritime colony, with a little town of their own, composed of captains, doctors, engineers, officers, artificers, and sailors, living together on the company's wages, and as regards the upper classes, at tables provided by the company. But I saw there no women of any description. I beg therefore to suggest to the company that their servants would probably be much more comfortable if the institution partook less of the monastic order.",

    "Description":"We steamed up the coast for two days quietly, placidly, and steadily. I cannot say that the trip was a pleasant one, remembering how intense was the heat. On one occasion we stopped for practice-shooting, and it behoved me of course to mount the paddle-box and see what was going on. This was at eleven in the morning, and though it did not last for above an hour, I was brought almost to fainting by the power of the sun.\n \n Punta-arenas—Sandy Point—is a small town and harbour situated in Costa Rica, near the top of the Bay of Nicoya, The sail up the bay is very pretty, through almost endless woods stretching away from the shores to the hills. There is, however, nothing majestic or grand about the scenery here. There are no Andes in sight, no stupendous mountains such as one might expect to see after coming so far to see them. It is all pretty quiet and ordinary; and on the whole perhaps superior to the views from the sea at Herne Bay.\n \n [...]\n \n It is a small village lying along a creek of the sea, inside the sandy point from whence it is named. Considerable business is done here in the exportation of coffee, which is the staple produce of Costa Rica. It is sent chiefly to England; but it seemed to me that the money-making inhabitants of Punta-arenas were mostly Americans; men who either had been to California or who had got so far on their road thither and then changed their minds. It is a hot, dusty, unattractive spot, with a Yankee inn, at which men may \"liquor,\" and a tram railroad running for twelve miles into the country. It abounds in oysters and beer, on which we dined before we started on our journey.",

    "Description":"My visit was solely to Costa Rica, which has in some respects done better than its neighbours. But this has been owing to the circumstances of its soil and climate rather than to those of its government, which seems to me to be as bad as any can be which deserves that name. In Costa Rica there certainly is a government, and a very despotic one it is.\n \n [...]\n \n They told me that the soil in Costa Rica was very favourable to the sugar-cane, and I looked out to see some sugar among the coffee. But not a hogshead came that way. We saw patches of the cane growing by the roadside; but no more was produced than what sufficed for the use of the proprietor himself, and for such sale as the traffic on the road afforded. Indeed, I found that they do not make sugar, so called, in Costa Rica, but import what they use. The article fabricated is called by them \"dulce.\" It comes from their hands in ugly round brown lumps, of the consistency of brick, looking, in truth, much more like a large brickbat than any possible saccharine arrangement. Nevertheless, the canes are fairly good, and the juice as sweet as that produced in first-rate sugar-growing soils.\n \n [...]\n \n Indeed, no climate can, I imagine, be more favourable to fertility and to man's comfort at the same time than that of the interior of Costa Rica. The sugar-cane comes to maturity much quicker than in Demerara or Cuba. There it should be cut in about thirteen or fourteen months from the time it is planted; in Nicaragua and Costa Rica it comes to perfection in nine or ten. The ground without manure will afford two crops of corn in a year. Coffee grows in great perfection, and gives a very heavy crop. The soil is all volcanic, or, I should perhaps more properly say, has been the produce of volcanoes, and is indescribably fertile. And all this has been given without that intensity of heat which in those southern regions generally accompanies tropical fertility, and which makes hard work fatal to a white man; while it creates lethargy and idleness, and neutralizes gifts which would otherwise be regarded as the fairest which God has bestowed on his creatures. In speaking thus, I refer to the central parts of Costa Rica only, to those which lie some thousand feet above the level of the sea. Along the sea-shores, both of the Atlantic and Pacific, the heat is as great, and the climate as unwholesome as in New Granada or the West Indies. It would be difficult to find a place worse circumstanced in this respect than Punta-arenas.",

    "Description":"[Point very approximate.]\n \n Our road hitherto had been rising nearly the whole way, and had been generally through a picturesque country. We ascended one long severe hill, severe that is as a road, though to a professed climber of mountains it would be as nothing. From the summit of this hill we had a magnificent view down to the Pacific, Again, at a sort of fortress through which we passed, and which must have been first placed there by the old Spaniards to guard the hill-passes, we found a very lovely landscape looking down into the valley. Here some show of a demand was made for passports; but we had none to exhibit, and no opposition was made to our progress. Except at these two places, the scenery, which was always more or less, pretty, was never remarkable. And even at the two points named there was nothing to equal the mountain scenery of many countries in Europe.\n \n What struck me most was the constant traffic on the road or track over which we passed. I believe I may call it a road, for the produce of the country is brought down over it in bullock carts; and I think that in South Wales I have taken a gig over one very much of the same description. But it is extremely rude; and only fit for solid wooden wheels—circles, in fact, of timber—such as are used, and for the patient, slow step of the bullocks.\n \n But during the morning and evening hours the strings of these bullock carts were incessant. They travel from four till ten, then rest till three or four, and again proceed for four or five hours in the cool of the evening. They are all laden with coffee, and the idea they give is, that the growth of that article in Costa Rica must be much more than sufficient to supply the whole world. For miles and miles we met them, almost without any interval. Coffee, coffee, coffee; coffee, coffee, coffee! It is grown in large quantities, I believe, only in the high lands of San José; and all that is exported is sent down to Punta-arenas, though by travelling this route it must either pass across the isthmus railway at a vast cost, or else be carried round the Horn. At present half goes one way and half the other. But not a grain is carried, as it should all be carried, direct to the Atlantic. When I come to speak of the road from San José to Greytown, the reason for this will be understood.\n \n The bivouacs made on the roadside by the bullock drivers for their night and noon accommodation are very picturesque when seen filled by the animals. A piece of flat ground is selected by the roadside, about half an acre in size, and close to a river or some running water. Into this one or two hundred bullocks are taken, and then released from their carts. But they are kept yoked together to prevent their straying. Here they are fed exclusively on sugar-canes, which the men carry with them, and buy along the road. The drovers patiently cut the canes up with their knives, and the beasts patiently munch them. Neither the men nor the animals roar, as they would with us, or squabble for the use of the water-course, or curse their own ill luck or the good luck of their neighbours. Drivers and driven are alike orderly, patient, and slow, spending their lives in taking coffee down to Punta-arenas, and in cutting and munching thousands of sugar-canes.\n \n We passed some of those establishments by moonlight, and they looked like large crowded fairs full of low small booths. The men, however, do not put up tents, but sleep out in their carts.",

That men should be found with their heads under their shoulders, or even living in holes burrowed in the ground, I had not ventured to hope. But when a man has travelled all the way to Costa Rica, he does expect something strange. He does not look to find everything as tame and flat and uninteresting as though he were riding into a sleepy little borough town in Wiltshire.\n \n [...]\n \n But there is little more interest to be found in entering San José than in driving through the little Wiltshire town above alluded to. The houses are comfortable enough. They are built with very ordinary doors and windows, of one or two stories according to the wealth of the owners, and are decently clean outside, though apparently rather dirty within. The streets are broad and straight, being all at right angles to each other, and though not very well paved, are not rough enough to elicit admiration. There is a square, the pláza, in which stands the cathedral, the barracks, and a few of the best houses in the town. There is a large and tolerably well-arranged market-place. There is a really handsome set of public buildings, and there are two moderately good hotels. What more can a man rationally want if he travel for business? And if he travel for pleasure how can he possibly find less?",

I was there in April, and at that time, except for a few hours in the middle of the day, and that only on some days, there was nothing like tropical heat. Within ten days of my leaving San José I heard natives at Panamá complaining of the heat as being altogether unendurable. But up there, on that high plateau, the sun had no strength that was inconvenient even to an Englishman.\n \n [...]\n \n But though the valley or plateau of San José, and the interior of the country generally is thus favourably situated, I cannot say that the nation is prosperous. It seems to be God's will that highly-fertile countries should not really prosper. Man's energy is brought to its highest point by the presence of obstacles to be overcome, by the existence of difficulties which are all but insuperable. And therefore a Scotch farm will give a greater value in produce than an equal amount of land in Costa Rica. When nature does so much, man will do next to nothing!",

The building itself is mean enough, but the internal decorations are not badly arranged, and the general appearance is neat, orderly, and cool. We all know the usual manner in which wooden and waxen virgins are dressed and ornamented in such churches. There is as much of this here as elsewhere; but I have seen it done in worse taste both in France and Italy. The façade of the church, fronting the pláza is hardly to be called a portion of the church; but is an adjunct to it, or rather the church has been fixed on to the façade, which is not without some architectural pretension.\n \n [...]\n \n During the whole of Passion Week there was a considerable amount of religious activity, in the way of preaching and processions, which reached its acme on Good Friday. On that day the whole town was processioning from morning—which means four o'clock—till evening—which means two hours after sunset. They had three figures, or rather three characters,—for two of them appeared in more than one guise and form,—each larger than life; those, namely, of our Saviour, the Virgin, and St. John. These figures are made of wax, and the faces of some of them were excellently moulded. These are manufactured in Guatemala—as the priests are; and the people there pride themselves on their manufacture, not without reason.\n \n The figures of our Saviour and the Virgin were in different dresses and attitudes, according to the period of the day which it was intended to represent; but the St. John was always represented in the dress of a bishop of the present age. The figures were supported on men's shoulders, and were carried backwards and forwards through every portion of the town, till at last, having been brought forth in the morning from the cathedral, they were allowed at night to rest in a rival, and certainly better built, though smaller church.",

The road also is fairly good; so good that a species of omnibus runs on it daily, there being some considerable traffic between the places; for Cartago is the second town in the republic.\n \n Cartago is now the second town, but not long since it was the capital. It was, however, destroyed by an earthquake; and though it has been rebuilt, it has never again taken its former position. Its present population is said to be ten thousand; but this includes not only the suburbs, but the adjacent villages. The town covers a large tract of ground, which is divided into long, broad, parallel streets, with a large pláza in the middle; as though it had been expected that a fine Utopian city would have sprung up. Alas! there is nothing fine about it, and very little that is Utopian.",

    "Description":"The guide however now knew the spot. We were near the summit of Irazu, and a further ride of a quarter of an hour took us there; and indeed here there was no difficulty in riding. The side of the hill was covered with grass, and not over steep. \"There,\" said the mild voice, pointing to a broad, bushy, stumpy tree, \"there is the place where Lady Ouseley breakfasted.\" And he looked at our modest havresack. \"And we will breakfast there too,\" I answered. \"But we will go down the crater first.\"\n \n \"Oh, yes; certainly,\" said the mild voice. \"But perhaps—I don't know—I am not sure I can go exactly down into the crater.\"\n \n The crater of the volcano is not at the top of the mountain, or rather it is not at what is now the top of the mountain; so that at first one has to look down upon it. I doubt even whether the volcano has ever effected the absolute summit. I may as well state here that the height of the mountain on which we were now standing is supposed to be 11,500 feet above the sea-level.\n \n Luckily for us, though the mist reached to us where we stood, everything to the left of us was clear, and we could look down, down into the crater as into a basin. Everything was clear, so that we could count the different orifices, eight in number, of which two, however, had almost run themselves into one; and see, as far as it was possible to see, how the present formation of the volcano had been brought about.\n \n It was as though a very large excavation had been made on the side of a hill, commencing, indeed, not quite from the summit, but very near it, and leaving a vast hole—not deep in proportion to its surface—sloping down the mountain-side. This huge excavation, which I take to be the extent of the crater, for it has evidently been all formed by the irruption of volcanic matter, is divided into two parts, a broken fragment of a mountain now lying between them; and the smaller of these two has lost all volcanic appearance. It is a good deal covered with bush and scrubby forest trees, and seems to have no remaining connection with sulphur and brimstone.\n \n The other part, in which the crater now absolutely in use is situated, is a large hollow in the mountain-side, which might perhaps contain a farm of six hundred acres. Not having been able to measure it, I know no other way of describing what appeared to me to be its size. But a great portion of this again has lost all its volcanic appendages; except, indeed, that lumps of lava are scattered over the whole of it, as they are, though more sparingly, over the mountain beyond. There is a ledge of rock running round the interior of this division of the excavation, half-way down it, like a row of seats in a Roman amphitheatre, or an excrescence, if one can fancy such, half-way down a teacup. The ground above this ledge is of course more extensive than that below, as the hollow narrows towards the bottom. The present working mouth of the volcanic, and all those that have been working for many a long year—the eight in number of which I have spoken—lie at the bottom of this lowest hollow. This I should say might contain a farm of about two hundred acres.\n \n [Text goes on for some time about the crater with descriptions of flora and weather.]",

    "Description":"[Location estimated.]\n \n We took four mules, that was one each for ourselves, and two for our baggage; we had two guides or muleteers, according to bargain, both of whom travelled on foot. The understanding was, that one mule lightly laden with provisions and a pair of slippers and tooth-brush should accompany us, one man also going with us; but that the heavy-laden mule should come along after us at its own pace. Things, however, did not so turn out: on the first day both the men and both the mules lagged behind, and on one occasion we were obliged to wait above an hour for them; but after that we all kept in a string together, having picked up a third muleteer somewhere on the road. We had also with us a distressed British subject, who was intrusted to my tender mercies by the Consul at San José. He was not a good sample of a Britisher; he had been a gold-finder in California, then a filibuster, after that a teacher of the piano in the country part of Costa Rica, and lastly an omnibus driver. He was to act as interpreter for us, which, however, he did not do with much honesty or zeal.\n \n Our road at first lay through the towns of Aredia and Barba, the former of which is a pleasant-looking little village, where, however, we found great difficulty in getting anything to drink. Up to this, and for a few leagues further, the road was very fair, and the land on each side of us was cultivated. We had started at eight a.m., and at about three in the afternoon there seemed to be great doubt as to where we should stop. The leading muleteer wished to take us to a house of a friend of his own, whereas the lieutenant and I resolved that the day's work had not been long enough. I take it that on the whole we were right, and the man gave in with sufficient good humour; but it ended in our passing the night in a miserable rancho. That at the potrero, on the road to the volcanic mountain, had been a palace to it.\n \n And here we got into the forest; we had hitherto been ascending the whole way from San José, and had by degrees lost all appearance of tillage. Still, however, there had been open spaces here and there cleared for cattle, and we had not as yet found ourselves absolutely enveloped by woods. This rancho was called Buena-vista; and certainly the view from it was very pretty. It was pretty and extensive, as I have seen views in Baden and parts of Bavaria; but again there was nothing about which I could rave.",

    "Description":"On the next morning we again ascended for about a couple of leagues, and as long as we did so the road was still good; the surface was hard, and the track was broad, and a horseman could wish nothing better. And then we reached the summit of the ridge over which we were passing; this we did at a place called Desenganos, and from thence we looked down into vast valleys all running towards the Atlantic. Hitherto the fall of water had been into the Pacific.\n \n At this place we found a vast shed, with numberless bins and troughs lying under it in great confusion. The facts, as far as I could learn, were thus: Up to this point the government, that is Don Juan Mora, or perhaps his predecessor, had succeeded in making a road fit for the transit of mule carts. This shed had also been built to afford shelter for the postmen and accommodation for the muleteers. But here Don Juan's efforts had been stopped; money probably had failed; and the great remainder of the undertaking will, I fear, be left undone for many a long year.\n \n And yet this, or some other road from the valley of San José to the Atlantic, would be the natural outlet of the country. At present the coffee grown in the central high lands is carried down to Punta-arenas on the Pacific, although it must cross the Atlantic to reach its market; consequently, it is either taken round the Horn, and its sale thus delayed for months, or it is transported across the isthmus by railway, at an enormous cost. They say there is a point at which the Atlantic may be reached more easily than by the present route of the Serapiqui river; nothing, however, has as yet been done in the matter. To make a road fit even for mule carts, by the course of the present track, would certainly be a work of enormous difficulty.",

    "Description":"Splash, splash, slosh, slosh! we were at it all day. At Careblanco—the place of the white-faced pigs I understood it to mean;—they say that there is a race of wild hogs with white faces which inhabit the woods hereabouts—we overtook the post, and kept close to them afterwards. This was a pasture farm in the very middle of the forest, a bit of cleared land on which some adventurer had settled himself and dared to live. The adventurer himself was not there, but he had a very pretty wife, with whom my friend the lieutenant seemed to have contracted an intimate acquaintance on his previous journey up to San José.\n \n But at Careblanco we only stopped two minutes, during which, however, it became necessary that the lieutenant should go into the rancho on the matter of some article of clothes which had been left behind on his previous journey; and then, again, on we went, slosh, slosh, splash, splash! My shins by this time were black and blue, and I held myself on to my mule chiefly by my spurs. Our way was still through dense forest, and was always either up or down hill.\n \n And here we came across the grandest scenery that I met with in the western world; scenery which would admit of raving, if it were given to me to rave on such a subject.\n \n We were travelling for the most part along the side of a volcanic mountain, and every now and then the declivity would become so steep as to give us a full view down into the ravine below, with the prospect of the grand, steep, wooded hill on the other side, one huge forest stretching up the mountain for miles. At the bottom of the ravine one's eye would just catch a river, looking like a moving thread of silver wire. And yet, though the descent was so great, there would be no interruption to it. Looking down over the thick forest trees which grew almost from the side of a precipice, the eye would reach the river some thousand feet below, and then ascend on the other side over a like unbroken expanse of foliage.\n \n Of course we both declared that we had never seen anything to equal it. In moments of ecstasy one always does so declare. But there was a monotony about it, and a want of grouping which forbids me to place it on an equality with scenery really of the highest kind, with the mountains, for instance, round Colico, with the head of the Lake of the Four Cantons, or even with the views of the upper waters of Killarney.",

We had picked up some more hard-boiled eggs at ranchos on the road, but hard-boiled eggs to my companion were no more than grains of gravel to a barn-door fowl; they merely enabled him to enjoy his regular diet. At this place, however, we were able to purchase fowls—skinny old hens which were shot for us at a moment's warning. The price being, here and elsewhere along the road, a dollar a head. Tea and candles a ministering angel had given to me at the moment of my departure from San José. But for them we should have indeed been comfortless, thirsty, and in utter darkness.

In the after part of the canoe sat the master boatman, the captain of the expedition, steering with a paddle. Then came the mails and our luggage, and next to them I sat, having a seat to myself, being too weighty to share a bench with a neighbour. I therefore could lean back among the luggage; and with a cigar in my mouth, with a little wooden bicher of weak brandy and water beside me, I found that the position had its charms.\n \n [...]\n \n The Serapiqui is a fine river; very rapid, but not so much so as to make it dangerous, if care be taken to avoid the snags. There is not a house or hut on either side of it; but the forest comes down to the very brink. Up in the huge trees the monkeys hung jabbering, shaking their ugly heads at the boat as it went down, or screaming in anger at this invasion of their territories. The macaws flew high over head, making their own music, and then there was the constant little splash of the paddle in the water. The boatmen spoke no word, but worked on always, pausing now and again for a moment to drink out of the hollow of their hands. And the sun became hotter and hotter as we neared the sea; and the musquitoes began to bite; and cigars were lit with greater frequency. 'Tis thus that one goes down the waters of the Serapiqui.",

    "Description":"On the next morning we reached Greytown, following the San Juan river down to that pleasant place. There is another passage out to the sea by the Colorado, a branch river which, striking out from the San Juan, runs into the ocean by a shorter channel. This also has been thought of as a course for the projected canal, preferable to that of the San Juan. I believe them to be equally impracticable. The San Juan river itself is so shallow that we were frequently on the ground even in our light canoe.\n \n And what shall I say of Greytown? We have a Consul-General there, or at least had one when these pages were written; a Consul-General whose duty it is, or was, to have under his special care the King of Mosquitia—as some people are pleased to call this coast—of the Mosquito coast as it is generally styled. Bluefields, further along the coast, is the chosen residence of this sable tyrant; but Greytown is the capital of his dominions. Now it is believed that, in deference to the feelings of the United States, and to the American reading of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and in deference, I may add, to a very sensible consideration that the matter is of no possible moment to ourselves, the protectorate of the Mosquito coast is to be abandoned. What the king will do I cannot imagine; but it will be a happy day I should think for our Consul when he is removed from Greytown. Of all the places in which I have ever put my foot, I think that is the most wretched. It is a small town, perhaps of two thousand inhabitants, though this on my part is a mere guess, at the mouth of the San Juan, and surrounded on every side either by water or impassable forests. A walk of a mile in any direction would be impossible, unless along the beach of the sea; but this is of less importance, as the continual heat would prevent any one from thinking of such exercise. Sundry Americans live here, worshipping the almighty dollar as Americans do, keeping liquor shops and warehouses; and with the Americans, sundry Englishmen and sundry Germans. Of the female population I saw nothing except some negro women, and one white, or rather red-faced owner of a rum shop. The native population are the Mosquito Indians; but it seems that they are hardly allowed to live in Greytown. They are to be seen paddling about in their canoes, selling a few eggs and chickens, catching turtle, and not rarely getting drunk. They would seem from their colour and physiognomy to be a cross between the negro and the Indian; and such I imagine to be the case. They have a language of their own, but those on the coast almost always speak English also.",

The dock-yard, which is connected with the convict establishment, is at an island called Ireland; but the residence of the admiral is not far from Hamilton, on that which the Bermudians call the \"Continent.\"\n \n I spent a week in each of these towns, and I can hardly say which I found the most triste. The island, or islands, as one must always say—using the plural number—have many gifts of nature to recommend them. They are extremely fertile. The land, with a very moderate amount of cultivation, will give two crops of ordinary potatoes, and one crop of sweet potatoes in the year. Most fruits will grow here, both those of the tropics and of the more northern latitudes. Oranges and lemons, peaches and strawberries, bananas and mulberries thrive, or would thrive equally well, if they were even slightly encouraged to do so.",

    "Description":"Snow is not prevalent in Bermuda, at least not in the months of May and June; but the first look of the houses in each of its two small towns, and indeed all over the island, gives one the idea of a snow storm. Every house is white, up from the ground to the very point of the roof. Nothing is in so great demand as whitewash. They whitewash their houses incessantly, and always include the roofs. This becomes a nuisance, from the glare it occasions; and is at last painful to the eyes. They say there that it is cleanly and cheap, and no one can deny that cleanliness and economy are important domestic virtues.\n \n [...]\n \n No climate in the world probably is better adapted for beetroot, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes. The place is so circumstanced geographically that it should be the early market-garden for New York—as to a certain small extent it is. New York cannot get her early potatoes—potatoes in May and June—from her own soil; but Bermuda can give them to her in any quantity.\n \n Arrowroot also grows here to perfection. The Bermudians claim to say that their arrowroot is the best in the world; and I believe that none bears a higher price. Then the land produces barley, oats, and Indian corn; and not only produces them, but produces two, sometimes three crops a year. Let the English farmer with his fallow field think of that.\n \n But with all their advantages Bermuda is very poor. Perhaps, I should add, that on the whole, she is contented with her poverty. And if so, why disturb such contentment?\n \n But, nevertheless, one cannot teach oneself not to be desirous of progress. One cannot but feel it sad to see people neglecting the good things which are under their feet. Lemons and oranges there are now none in Bermuda. The trees suffered a blight some year or two since, and no effort has been made to restore them. I saw no fruit of any description, though I am told I was there in the proper season, and heard much of the fruit that there used to be in former days. I saw no vegetables but potatoes and onions, and was told that as a rule the people are satisfied with them. I did not once encounter a piece of meat fit to be eaten, excepting when I dined on rations supplied by the Convict establishment. The poultry was somewhat better than the meat, but yet of a very poor description. Both bread and butter are bad; the latter quite uneatable. English people whom I met declared that they were unable to get anything to eat. The people, both white and black, seemed to be only half awake. The land is only half cultivated; and hardly half is tilled of that which might be tilled.\n \n The reason of this neglect, for I maintain that it is neglect, should however be explained. Nearly all the islands are covered with small stunted bushy cedar trees. Not cedars such as those of Lebanon, not the cedar trees of Central America, nor those to which we are accustomed in our gardens at home. In Bermuda they are, as I have said, low bushy trees, much resembling stunted firs. But the wood, when it can be found large enough, is, they say, good for shipbuilding; and as shipbuilding has for years been a trade in these islands, the old owners of the property do not like to clear their land.",

    "Description":"These islands are certainly very pretty; or I should perhaps say that the sea, which forms itself into bays and creeks by running in among them, is very pretty. The water is quite clear and transparent, there being little or no sand on those sides on which the ocean makes its entrance; and clear water is in itself so beautiful. Then the singular way in which the land is broken up into narrow necks, islands, and promontories, running here and there in a capricious, half-mysterious manner, creating a desire for amphibiosity, necessarily creates beauty. But it is mostly the beauty of the sea, and not of the land. The islands are flat, or at any rate there is no considerable elevation in them. They are covered throughout with those scrubby little trees; and, although the trees are green, and therefore when seen from the sea give a freshness to the landscape, they are uninteresting and monotonous on shore.\n \n I must not forget the oleanders, which at the time of my visit were in full flower; which, for aught I know, may be in full flower during the whole year. They are so general through all the islands, and the trees themselves are so covered with the large straggling, but bright blossoms, as to give quite a character to the scenery. The Bermudas might almost be called the oleander isles.",

    "Description":"There is no wall round the prison. I must explain that the convicts are kept on two islands, those called Boaz and Ireland. At Boaz is the parent establishment, at which live the controller, chaplains, doctors, and head officers. But here is the lesser number of prisoners, about six hundred. They live in ordinary prisons. The other nine hundred are kept in two hulks, old men-of-war moored by the breakwaters, at the dockyard establishment in Ireland. It was in one of these that the murder was committed. The labour of these nine hundred men is devoted to the dockyard works. There is a bridge between the two islands over which runs a public road, and from this road there are ways equally public, as far as the eye goes, to all parts of the prison. A man has only to say that he is going to the chaplain's house, and he may pass all through the prison,—with spirits in his pocket if it so please him. That the prisoners should not be about without warders is no doubt a prison rule; but where everything is done by the prisoners, from the building of stores to the picking of weeds and lighting of lamps, how can any moderate number of warders see everything, even if they were inclined? There is nothing to prevent spirits being smuggled in after dark through the prison windows. And the men do get rum, and drunkenness is a common offence. Prisoners may work outside prison walls; but I remember no other prison that is not within walls—that looks from open windows on to open roads, as is here the case.",

    "Description":"In that case let them not go on to what is called the Niagara Falls station, but pass over at a station called the Suspension Bridge—very well known on the road—to the other or Canada side of the water, and thence go to the Clifton Hotel. There can be no doubt as to this being the site at which tourists should stop. It is one of those cases in which to see is to be sure. But if the traveller be carried on to Niagara Falls station, he has a long and expensive journey to make back; and the United States side of the water will be antagonistic to him in doing so. The ticket from Albany to Niagara cost me six dollars; the carriage from Niagara to the Clifton Hotel cost me five. It was better to pay the five than to remain where I was; but it would have been better still to have saved them. I mention this as passengers to the Falls have no sort of intimation that they should get out at the Suspension Bridge; though they are all duly shaken out of their berths, and inquired of whether or not they be going west.\n \n Nothing ever disappointed me less than the Falls of Niagara—but my raptures did not truly commence for the first half-day. Their charms grow upon one like the conversation of a brilliant man. Their depth and breadth and altitude, their music, colour, and brilliancy are not fully acknowledged at the first moment. It may be that my eye is slow; but I can never take in to its full enjoyment any view or any picture at the first glance. I found this to be especially the case at Niagara. It was only by long gazing and long listening that I was able to appreciate the magnitude of that waste of waters.\n \n [...]\n \n But I must be allowed one word as to that visit after sunset; one word as to that which an obedient tourist will then see. In the spot to which I allude the visitor stands on a broad safe path, made of shingles, between the rock over which the water rushes and the rushing water. He will go in so far that the spray rising back from the bed of the torrent does not incommode him. With this exception, the further he can go the better; but here also circumstances will clearly show him the spot. Unless the water be driven in by a very strong wind, five yards make the difference between a comparatively dry coat and an absolutely wet one.\n \n And then let him stand with his back to the entrance, thus hiding the last glimmer of the expiring day. So standing he will look up among the falling waters, or down into the deep misty pit, from which they reascend in almost as palpable a bulk. The rock will be at his right hand, high and hard, and dark and straight, like the wall of some huge cavern, such as children enter in their dreams. For the first five minutes he will be looking but at the waters of a cataract,—at the waters, indeed, of such a cataract as we know no other, and at their interior curves, which elsewhere we cannot see. But by-and-by all this will change. He will no longer be on a shingly path beneath a waterfall; but that feeling of a cavern wall will grow upon him, of a cavern deep, deep below roaring seas, in which the waves are there, though they do not enter in upon him; or rather not the waves, but the very bowels of the deep ocean. He will feel as though the floods surrounded him, coming and going with their wild sounds, and he will hardly recognize that though among them he is not in them. And they, as they fall with a continual roar, not hurting the ear, but musical withal, will seem to move as the vast ocean waters may perhaps move in their internal currents. He will lose the sense of one continued descent, and think that they are passing round him in their appointed courses. The broken spray that rises from the depth below, rises so strongly, so palpably, so rapidly, that the motion in every direction will seem equal. And then, as he looks on, strange colours will show themselves through the mist; the shades of gray will become green and blue, with ever and anon a flash of white; and then, when some gust of wind blows in with greater violence, the sea-girt cavern will become all dark and black. Oh, my friend, let there be no one there to speak to thee then; no, not even a heart's brother. As you stand there speak only to the waters.",

    "Description":"The scenery round the town is so far from being inviting, that I did not feel the least inclination to explore it. I therefore remained in the town, and went up hill and down dale through the ill-paved streets. Coffee-houses appear in great abundance; but if it were not for the people sitting in front of them drinking coffee and smoking tobacco, no one would do these dirty rooms the honour of taking them for places of entertainment.\nIn the market and the squares we notice a great preponderance of the male sex over the female. The former are seen bustling about every where, and, like the Italians, perform some duties which usually fall to the lot of the softer sex. We notice a mixture of the most different nations, and among them a particularly large number of Jews.\nThe bazaar is overloaded with southern fruits of all kinds. Oranges and lemons are seen here in great numbers, like the commonest of our fruits. The prices are of course very trifling. The cauliflowers brought from Asia Minor are particularly fine. I noticed many as large as a man’s head.\nIn the evening I was required to repair to the harbour and re-embark.\nIt is almost impossible to form an idea of the confusion which reigns here. A wooden railing forms the barrier between the healthy people and those who come from or intend travelling to a country infected with the plague. Whoever passes this line of demarcation is not allowed to return. Soldiers, officers, government officials, and superintendents, the latter of whom are armed with sticks and pairs of tongs, stand at the entrance to drive those forcibly back who will not be content with fair words. Provisions and other articles are either thrown over the barrier or left in front of it. In the latter case, however, they may not be touched until the bearers have departed. A gentleman on the “plague” side wished to give a letter to one on the other; it was immediately snatched from his hand and handed across by means of a pair of tongs. And all this time such a noise and hubbub is going on, that you can scarcely hear the sound of your own voice.\n“Pray hand me over my luggage!” cries one. “Keep farther away! don’t come near me, and mind you don’t touch me!” anxiously exclaims another. And then the superintendents keep shouting—“Stand back, stand back!” etc.\nI was highly entertained by this spectacle; the scene was entirely new to me. But on my return, when I shall be one of the prisoners, I fear I may find it rather tedious. For this time I was not at all hindered in the prosecution of my journey.\nOn the whole, these timid precautions seemed to me exceedingly uncalled for, particularly at a time when neither the plague nor any kind of contagious disease prevailed in Turkey. One of my fellow-passengers had been banished to our ship on the previous day because he had had the misfortune to brush against an official on going to see after his luggage.\nAt seven o’clock the tattoo is beaten, the grating is shut, and the farce ends. We now repaired to the fourth and last steamer, the Ferdinand. From first to last we changed vessels six times during a journey from Vienna to Constantinople; we travelled by four steamers and twice in boats; a circumstance which cannot be reckoned among the pleasures of a trip down the Danube.\nThough not a large boat, the Ferdinand is comfortable and well built. Even the second-class cabin is neatly arranged, and a pretty stove diffused a warmth which was peculiarly grateful to us all, as the thermometer showed only six to eight degrees above zero. Unfortunately even here the men and women are not separated in the second-class cabin; but care is at least taken that third-class passengers do not intrude. Twelve berths are arranged round the walls, and in front of these are placed broad benches well cushioned.",

    "Description":"I arrived at Constantinople on a Tuesday, and immediately inquired what was worth seeing. I was advised to go and see the dancing dervishes, as this was the day on which they held their religious exercises in Pera.\nAs I reached the mosque an hour too soon, I betook myself in the meantime to the adjoining garden, which is set apart as the place of meeting of the Turkish women. Here several hundred ladies reclined on the grass in varied groups, surrounded by their children and their nurses, the latter of whom are all negresses. Many of these Turkish women were smoking pipes of tobacco with an appearance of extreme enjoyment, and drinking small cups of coffee without milk. Two or three friends often made use of the same pipe, which was passed round from mouth to mouth. These ladies seemed also to be partial to dainties: most of them were well provided with raisins, figs, sugared nuts, cakes, etc., and ate as much as the little ones. They seemed to treat their slaves very kindly; the black servants sat among their mistresses, and munched away bravely: the slaves are well dressed, and could scarcely be distinguished from their owners, were it not for their sable hue.\nDuring my whole journey I remarked with pleasure that the lot of a slave in the house of a Mussulman is not nearly so hard as we believe. The Turkish women are no great admirers of animated conversations; still there was more talking in their societies than in the assemblies of the men, who sit silent and half asleep in the coffee-houses, languidly listening to the narrations of a story-teller.\nThe ladies’ garden resembles a churchyard. Funeral monuments peer forth at intervals between the cypresses, beneath which the visitors sit talking and joking cheerfully. Every now and then one would suddenly start up, spread a carpet beside her companions, and kneel down to perform her devotions.\nAs no one of the male sex was allowed to be present, all were unveiled. I noticed many pretty faces among them, but not a single instance of rare or striking beauty. Fancy large brilliant eyes, pale cheeks, broad faces, and an occasional tendency to corpulence, and you have the ladies’ portrait. Small-pox must still be rather prevalent in these parts, for I saw marks of it on many faces.\nThe Turkish ladies’ costume is not very tasteful. When they go abroad, they are completely swathed in an upper garment, generally made of dark merino. In the harem, or in any place where men are not admitted, they doff this garment, and also the white cloth in which they wrap their heads and faces. Their costume consists, properly speaking, of very wide trousers drawn together below the ancle, a petticoat with large wide sleeves, and a broad sash round the waist. Over this sash some wear a caftan, others only a spencer, generally of silk. On their feet they wear delicate boots, and over these slippers of yellow morocco; on their heads a small fez-cap, from beneath which their hair falls on their shoulders in a number of thin plaits. Those Turks, male and female, who are descended from Mahomet, have either a green caftan or a green turban. This colour is here held so sacred, that scarcely any one may wear it. I would even advise the Franks to avoid green in their dresses, as they may expose themselves to annoyance by using it.\nAfter I had had more than an hour’s leisure to notice all these circumstances, a noise suddenly arose in the courtyard, which produced a stir among the women. I considered from these appearances that it was time to go to the temple, and hastened to join my party. A great crowd was waiting in the courtyard, for the Sultan was expected. I was glad to have the good fortune to behold him on the very day of my arrival. As a stranger, I was allowed, without opposition, a place in the front ranks,—a trait of good breeding on the part of the Turks which many a Frank would do well to imitate. In a Turk, moreover, this politeness is doubly praiseworthy, from the fact that he looks upon my poor sex with great disrespect; indeed, according to his creed, we have not even a soul.\nI had only stood a few moments, when the Sultan appeared on horseback, surrounded by his train. He alone rode into the courtyard; the others all dismounted at the gate, and entered on foot. The horse on which the Sultan rode was of rare beauty, and, as they told me, of the true Arabian breed; the saddle-cloth was richly embroidered with gold, and the stirrups, of the same precious metal, were in the form of shoes, covered with the finest chased work.",

    "Description":"I chose a Friday for an excursion to Scutari, the celebrated burying-place of the Turks, in order that I might have an opportunity of seeing the “howling dervishes.”\nIn company with a French physician, I traversed the Bosphorus in a kaik. {48} We passed by the “Leander’s Tower,” which stands in the sea, a few hundred paces from the Asiatic coast, and has been so frequently celebrated in song by the poets. We soon arrived at our destination.\nIt was with a peculiar feeling of emotion that for the first time in my life I set foot on a new quarter of the globe. Now, and not till now, I seemed separated by an immeasurable distance from my home. Afterwards, when I landed on the coast of Africa, the circumstance did not produce the same impression on my mind.\nNow at length I was standing in the quarter of the earth which had been the cradle of the human race; where man had risen high, and had again sunk so low that the Almighty had almost annihilated him in his righteous anger. And here in Asia it was that the Son of God came on earth to bring the boon of redemption to fallen man. My long and warmly-cherished wish to tread this most wonderful of the four quarters of the earth was at length fulfilled, and with God’s help I might confidently hope to reach the sacred region whence the true light of the world had shone forth.\nBurial Place at Scutari.\nScutari is the place towards which the Mussulman looks with the hope of one day reposing beneath its shade. No disciple of any other creed is allowed to be buried here; and here, therefore, the Mahometan feels himself at home, and worthy of his Prophet. The cemetery is the grandest in the world. One may wander for hours through this grove of cypresses, without reaching the end. On the gravestones of the men turbans are sculptured; on those of the women fruits and flowers: the execution is in most cases very indifferent.\nThough neither the chief nor the tributary streets in Scutari are even, they are neither so badly paved nor quite so narrow as those at Pera. The great barracks, on a height in the foreground, present a splendid appearance, and also afford a delicious view towards the Sea of Marmora and the inimitably beautiful Bosphorus. The barracks are said to contain accommodation for 10,000 men.",

    "Description":"During the night we reached Cæsarea. With the eloquence of a Demosthenes, our captain endeavoured to dissuade us from our project of landing here; he pointed out to us the dangers to which we were exposing ourselves, and the risks we should run from Bedouins and snakes. The former, he averred, were accustomed to conceal themselves in hordes among the ruins, in order to ease travellers of their effects and money; being well aware that such spots were only visited by curious tourists with well-filled purses, they were continually on the watch, like the robber-knights of the good old German empire. “An enemy no less formidable,” said the captain, “was to be encountered in the persons of numerous snakes lurking in the old walls and on the weed-covered ground, which endangered the life of the traveller at every step.” We were perfectly well aware of these facts, having gleaned them partly from descriptions of voyages, partly from oral traditions; and so they were not powerful enough to arrest our curiosity. The captain himself was really less actuated by the sense of our danger, in advising us to abandon our undertaking, than by the reflection of the time it lost him; but he exerted himself in vain. He was obliged to cast anchor, and at daybreak to send a boat ashore with us.\nOur arms consisted of parasols and sticks (the latter we carried in order to beat the bushes); we were escorted by the captain, his servant, and a couple of sailors.\nIn the ruins we certainly met with a few suspicious-looking characters in the shape of wandering Bedouins. As it was too late to beat a retreat, we advanced bravely towards them with trusting and friendly looks. The Bedouins did the same, and so there was an end of this dangerous affair. We climbed from one fragment to another, and certainly spent more than two hours among the ruins, without sustaining the slightest injury at the hands of these people. Of the threatened snakes we saw not a single one.\nRuins, indeed, we found every where in plenty. Whole side-walls, which appeared to have belonged to private houses, but not to splendid palaces or temples, stood erect and almost unscathed. Fragments of pillars lay scattered about in great abundance, but without capitals, pedestals, or friezes.\nIt was with a feeling of awe hitherto unknown to me that I trod the ground where my Redeemer had walked. Every spot, every building became invested with a double interest. “Perchance,” I thought, “I may be lingering within the very house where Jesus once sojourned.” More than satisfied with my excursion, I returned to our bark.\nBy three o’clock in the afternoon we were close under the walls of Joppa. To enter this harbour, partially choked up as it is with sand, is described as a difficult feat. We were assured that we should see many wrecks of stranded ships and boats; accordingly I strained my eyes to the utmost, and could discover nothing. We ran safely in; and thus ended a little journey in the course of which I had seen many new and interesting objects, besides gaining some insight into the mode of life among the sailors. Frequently, when it fell calm, our Arabs would recline on the ground in a circle, singing songs of an inconceivably inharmonious and lugubrious character, while they clapped their hands in cadence, and burst at intervals into a barking laugh. I could not find any thing very amusing in this entertainment; on the contrary, it had the effect of making me feel very melancholy, as displaying these good people in a very idiotic and degrading light.\nThe costume of the sailors was simple in the extreme. A shirt covered them in rather an imperfect manner, and a handkerchief bound round their heads protected them from a coup de soleil. The captain was distinguished from the rest only by his turban, which looked ridiculous enough, surmounting his half-clad form. Their diet consisted of a single warm meal of pilau or beans, eaten in the evening. During the day they stayed their appetites with bread. Their drink was water.\nThe town of Joppa, extending from the sea-shore to the summit of a rather considerable and completely isolated hill, has a most peculiar appearance. The lower street is surrounded by a wall, and appears sufficiently broad; the remaining streets run up the face of the hills, and seem at a distance to be resting on the houses below. Viewing the town from our boat, I could have sworn that people were walking about on flat house-tops.\nAs Joppa boasts neither an inn nor a convent which might shelter a traveller, I waited upon the Consul of the Austrian Empire, Herr D---, who received me very kindly and introduced me to his family, which comprised his lady, three sons, and three daughters. They wore the Turkish costume. The daughters, two of whom were exceedingly beautiful, wore wide trousers, a caftan, and a sash round the waist. On their heads they had little fez-caps, and their hair was divided into fifteen or twenty narrow plaits, interwoven with little gold coins, and a larger one at the end of each plait. A necklace of gold coins encircled their necks. The mother was dressed in exactly the same way. When elderly women have little or no hair left, they make up with artificial silk plaits for the deficiencies of nature.\nThe custom of wearing coins as ornaments is so prevalent throughout Syria, that the very poorest women, girls, and children strive to display as many as possible. Where they cannot sport gold, they content themselves with silver money; and where even this metal is not attainable, with little coins of copper and other baser metals.\nThe Consul and his son were also clothed in the Turkish garb; but instead of a turban the father wore an old cocked hat, which gave him an indescribably ludicrous appearance. A son and a daughter of this worthy patron of the semi-Turkish, semi-European garb, had but one eye, a defect frequently met with in Syria. It is generally supposed to be caused by the dry heat, the fine particles of sand, and the intense glare of the chalky hills.\nAs I reached Joppa early in the afternoon, I proceeded in company of the Consul to view the town and its environs. In dirt, bad paving, etc., I found it equal to any of the towns I had yet seen. The lower street, near the sea, alone is broad and bustling, with loaded and unloaded camels passing continually to and fro. The bazaar is composed of some miserable booths containing common provisions and a few cheap wares.\nThe neighbourhood of Joppa is exceedingly fertile. Numerous large gardens, with trees laden with all kinds of tropical fruits, and guarded by impenetrable hedges of the Indian fig-tree, form a half-circle round the lower portion of the town.\nThe Indian fig-tree, which I here saw for the first time, has an odd appearance. From its stem, which is very dwarfish, leaves a foot in length, six inches in breadth, and half an inch in thickness, shoot forth. This tree seldom sends forth branches; the leaves grow one out of another, and at the extremity the fruit is formed. Its length is about two or three inches. Ten or twenty such figs are frequently found adhering to a single leaf.\nI could not conceive how it happened that in these hot countries, without rain to refresh them, the trees all looked so healthy and beautiful. This fact, I found, was owing to the numerous channels cut through the gardens, which are thus artificially irrigated. The heavy dews and cool nights also tend to restore the drooping vegetation. One great ornament of our gardens was, however, totally wanting—a lawn with wild flowers. Trees and vegetables here grow out of the sandy or stony earth, a circumstance hardly noticed at a distance, but which produces a disagreeable effect on a near view. Flowers I found none.\nDuring the night we reached Cæsarea.

    "Description":"Bethlehem lies on a hill, surrounded by several others; with the exception of the convent, it contains not a single handsome building. The inhabitants, half of whom are Catholics, muster about 2500 strong; many live in grottoes and semi-subterranean domiciles, cutting out garlands and other devices in mother-of pearl, etc. The number of houses does not exceed a hundred at the most, and the poverty here seems excessive, for nowhere have I been so much pestered with beggar children as in this town. Hardly has the stranger reached the convent-gates before these urchins are seen rapidly approaching from all quarters. One rushes forward to hold the horse, while a second grasps the stirrup; a third and a fourth present their arm to help you to dismount; and in the end the whole swarm unanimously stretch forth their hands for “backsheesh.” In cases like these it is quite necessary to come furnished either with a multiplicity of small coins or with a riding-whip, in order to be delivered in one way or another from the horrible importunity of the diminutive mob. It is very fortunate that the horses here are perfectly accustomed to such scenes; were this not the case, they would take fright and gallop headlong away.\nThe little convent and church are both situated near the town, and are built on the spot where the Saviour was born. The whole is surrounded by a strong fortress-wall, a very low, narrow gate forming the entrance. In front of this fortress extends a handsome well-paved area. So soon as we have passed through the little gate, we find ourselves in the courtyard, or rather in the nave of the church, which is unfortunately more than half destroyed, but must once have been eminent both for its size and beauty. Some traces of mosaic can still be detected on the walls. Two rows of high handsome pillars, forty-eight in number, intersect the interior; and the beam-work, said to be of cedar-wood from Lebanon, looks almost new. Beneath the high altar of this great church is the grotto in which Christ was born. Two staircases lead downwards to it. One of the staircases belongs to the Armenians, the other to the Greeks; the Catholics have none at all. Both the walls and the floor are covered with marble slabs. A marble tablet, with the inscription,\n“HIC DE VIRGINE MARIA JESUS CHRISTUS NATUS EST,”\nmarks the spot whence the true Light shone abroad over the world. A figure of a beaming sun, which receives its light from numerous lamps kept continually burning, is placed in the back-ground of this tablet.\nThe spot where our Saviour was shewn to the worshipping Magi is but few paces distant. An altar is erected opposite, on the place where the manger stood in which the shepherds found our Lord. The manger itself is deposited in the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome. This altar belongs to the Roman Catholics. A little door, quite in the background of the grotto, leads to a subterranean passage communicating with the convent and the Catholic chapel. In this passage another altar has been erected to the memory of the innocents slaughtered and buried here. Proceeding along the passage we come upon the grave of St. Paula and her daughter Eustachia on one side, and that of St. Hieronymus on the other. The body of the latter is, however, deposited at Rome.",

    "Description":"t was only nine o’clock when we reached Nazareth, and repaired to the house for strangers in the Franciscan convent, where the priests welcomed us very kindly. As soon as we had made a short survey of our rooms (which resulted in our finding them very like those at Jerusalem, both as regards appearance and arrangement), we set forth once more to visit all the remarkable places, and above all the church which contains the Grotto of Annunciation. This church, to which we were accompanied by a clergyman, was built by St. Helena, and is of no great size. In the background a staircase leads down into the grotto, where it is asserted that the Virgin Mary received the Lord’s message from the angel. Three little pillars of granite are still to be seen in this grotto. The lower part of one of these pillars was broken away by the Turks, so that it is only fastened from above. On the strength of this circumstance many have averred that the pillar hangs suspended in air! Had these men but looked beyond their noses, had they only cast their eyes upwards, they could not have had the face to preach a miracle where it is so palpable that none exists. A picture on the wall, not badly executed, represents the Annunciation. The house of the Virgin is not shewn here, because, according to the legend, an angel carried it away to Loretto in Italy. A few steps lead to another grotto, affirmed to be the residence of a neighbour of the Virgin, during whose absence she presided over the house and attended to the duties of the absent Mary.\nAnother grotto in the town is shewn as “the workshop of Joseph;” it has been left in its primitive state, except that a plain wooden altar has been added. Not far off we find the synagogue where our Lord taught the people, thereby exasperating the Pharisees to such a degree, that they wished to cast Him down from a rock outside the city. In conclusion we were shewn an immense block of stone on which the Saviour is said to have eaten the Passover with His disciples(!).\nIn the afternoon we went to see “Mary’s Well,” on the road to Tabarith, at a short distance from Nazareth. This well is fenced round with masonry, and affords pure clear water. Hither, it is said, the Virgin came every day to draw water, and here the women and girls of Nazareth may still be daily seen walking to and fro with pitchers on their shoulders. Those whom we saw were all poorly clad, and looked dirty. Many wore no covering on their head, and, what was far worse, their hair hung down in a most untidy manner. Their bright eyes were the only handsome feature these people possessed. The custom of wearing silver coins round the head also prevailed here.\nTo-day was a day of misfortunes for me; in the morning, when we departed from Lagun, I had already felt unwell. On the road I was seized with violent headache, nausea, and feverish shiverings, so that I hardly thought I should be able to reach Nazareth. The worst of all this was, that I felt obliged to hide my illness, as I had done on our journey to Jerusalem, for fear I should be left behind. The wish to view all the holy places in Nazareth was also so powerful within me, that I made a great effort, and accompanied the rest of my party for the whole day, though I was obliged every moment to retire into the background that my condition might not be observed. But when we went to table, the smell of the viands produced such an effect upon me, that I hastily held my handkerchief before my face as though my nose were bleeding, and hurried out. Thanks to my sunburnt skin, through which no paleness could penetrate, no one noticed that I was ill. The whole day long I could eat nothing; but towards evening I recovered a little. My appetite now also returned, but unfortunately nothing was to be had but some bad mutton-broth and an omelette made with rancid oil. It is bad enough to be obliged to subsist on such fare when we are in health, but the hardship increases tenfold when we are ill. However, I sent for some bread and wine, and strengthened myself therewith as best I might.",

    "PlaceName":"Damascus",
    "PlaceNameModern":"Damascus",
    "NameOfTraveler":"Ida Pfeiffer",
    "YearOfTravel":1842,
    "Description":"Damascus is one of the most ancient cities of the East, but yet we see no ruins; a proof that no grand buildings ever existed here, and that therefore the houses, as they became old and useless, were replaced by new ones.\nTo-day we visited the seat of all the riches—the great bazaar. It is mostly covered in, but only with beams and straw mats. On both sides are rows of wooden booths, containing all kinds of articles, but a great preponderance of eatables, which are sold at an extraordinarily cheap rate. We found the “mish-mish” particularly good.\nAs in Constantinople, the rarest and most costly of the wares are not exposed for sale, but must be sought for in closed store-houses. The booths look like inferior hucksters’ shops, and each merchant is seen sitting in the midst of his goods. We passed hastily through the bazaar, in order soon to reach the great mosque, situate in the midst of it. As we were forbidden, however, not only to enter the mosque, but even the courtyard, we were obliged to content ourselves with wondering at the immense portals, and stealing furtive glances at the interior of the open space beyond. This mosque was originally a Christian church; and a legend tells that St. George was decapitated here.\nThe khan, also situate in the midst of the bazaar, is peculiarly fine, and is said to be the best in all the East. The high and boldly-arched portal is covered with marble, and enriched with beautiful sculptures. The interior forms a vast rotunda, surrounded by galleries, divided from each other, and furnished with writing-tables for the use of the merchants. Below in the hall the bales and chests are piled up, and at the side are apartments for travelling dealers. The greater portion of the floor and the walls is covered with marble.\nAltogether, marble seems to be much sought after at Damascus. Every thing that passes for beautiful or valuable is either entirely composed of this stone, or at least is inlaid with it. Thus a pretty fountain in a little square near the bazaar is of marble; and a coffee-house opposite the fountain, the largest and most frequented of any in Damascus, is ornamented with a few small marble pillars. But all these buildings, not even excepting the great bathing-house, would be far less praised and looked at if they stood in a better neighbourhood. As the case is, however, they shine forth nobly from among the clay houses of Damascus.\nIn the afternoon we visited the Grotto of St. Paul, lying immediately outside the town. On the ramparts we were shewn the place where the apostle is said to have leaped from the wall on horseback, reaching the ground in safety, and taking refuge from his enemies in the neighbouring grotto, which is said to have closed behind him by miracle, and not to have opened again until his persecutors had ceased their pursuit. At present, nothing is to be seen of this grotto excepting a small stone archway, like that of a bridge. Tombs of modern date, consisting of vaults covered with large blocks of stone, are very numerous near this grotto.\nWe paid several more visits, and every where found great pomp of inner arrangement and decoration, varying of course in different houses. We were always served with coffee, sherbet, and argilé; and in the houses of the Turks a dreary conversation was carried on through the medium of an interpreter.\nWalks and places of amusement there are none. The number of Franks resident here is too small to call for a place of general recreation, and the Turk never feels a want of this kind. The most he does is to saunter slowly from the bath to the coffee-house, and there to kill his time with the help of a pipe and a cup of coffee, staring vacantly on the ground before him. Although the coffee-houses are more frequented than any other buildings in the East, they are often miserable sheds, being all small, and generally built only of wood.\nThe inhabitants of Damascus wear the usual Oriental garb, but as a rule I thought them better dressed than in any Eastern town. Some of the women are veiled, but others go abroad with their faces uncovered. I saw here some very attractive countenances; and an unusual number of lovely children’s heads looked at me from all sides with an inquisitive smile.",

    "Description":"The aspect of this great Egyptian metropolis is not nearly so imposing as I had fancied it to be; its situation is too flat, and from on board we can only discern scattered portions of its extended area. The gardens skirting the shore are luxuriant and lovely.\nAt my debarcation, and on the road to the consulate, I met with several adventures, which I relate circumstantially, trifling as they may appear, in order to give a hint as to the best method of dealing with the people here.\nAt the very commencement I became involved in a dispute with the captain of the vessel. I had still to pay him three dollars and a half, and gave him four dollars, in the expectation that he would return me my change. This, however, he refused to do, and persisted in keeping the half-dollar. He said it should be divided as backsheesh among the crew; but I am sure they would have seen nothing of it. Luckily, however, he was stupid enough not to put the money in his pocket, but kept it open in his hand. I quickly snatched a coin from him, and put it into my pocket, explaining to him at the same time that he should not have it back until he had given me my change, adding that I would give the men a gratuity myself. He shouted and stormed, and kept on asking for the money. I took no heed of him, but continued quietly packing up my things. Seeing, at length, that nothing was to be done with me, he gave me back my half-dollar; whereupon we parted good friends. This affair concluded, I had to look about for a couple of asses; one for myself, and another for my luggage. If I had stepped ashore I should have been almost torn in pieces by contending donkey-drivers, each of whom would have lugged me in a different direction. I therefore remained quietly for a time in my cabin, until the drivers ceased to suspect that any one was there. In the meantime I had been looking upon the shore from the cabin-window, and speculating upon which animal I should take; then I quickly rushed out, and before the proprietors of the long-eared steeds were aware of my intention, I had seized one by the bridle and pointed to another. This concluded the matter at once; for the proprietors of the chosen animals defended me from the rest, and returned with me to the boat to carry my baggage.\nA fellow came up and arranged my little trunk on the back of the ass. For this trifling service I gave him a piastre; but observing that I was alone, he probably thought he could soon intimidate me into giving whatever he demanded. So he returned me my piastre, and demanded four. I took the money, and told him (for fortunately he understood a little Italian) that if he felt dissatisfied with this reward he might accompany me to the consulate, where his four piastres would be paid so soon as it appeared that he had earned them. He shouted and blustered, just as the captain had done; but I remained deaf, and rode forward towards the custom-house. Then he came down to three piastres, then to two, and finally said he would be content with one, which I threw to him. When I reached the custom-house, hands were stretched out towards me from all sides; I gave something to the chief person, and let the remaining ones clamour on. When, after experiencing these various annoyances, I rode on towards the town, a new obstacle arose. My Arab guide inquired whither he should conduct me. I endeavoured in vain to explain to him where I wanted to go; he could not be made to understand me. Nothing now remained for me but to accost every well-dressed Oriental whom I met, until I should find one who could understand either French or Italian. The third person I addressed fortunately knew something of the latter language, and I begged him to tell my guide to take me to the Austrian consulate. This was done, and my troubles concluded.\nA ride of three quarters of an hour in a very broad handsome street, planted with a double row of a kind of acacia altogether strange to me, among a crowd of men, camels, asses, etc., brought me to the town, the streets of which are in general narrow. There is so much noise and crowding every where, that one would suppose a tumult had broken out. But as I approached, the immense mass always opened as if by magic, and I pursued my way without hindrance to the consulate, which lies hidden in a little narrow blind alley.\nI went immediately to the office, and presented myself to the consul, with the request that he would recommend me a respectable inn of the second class. Herr Chamgion, the consul, interested himself for me with heartfelt kindness; he immediately despatched a kavasse to an innkeeper whom he knew, paid my guide, and recommended the host strongly to take good care of me; in short, he behaved towards me with true Christian kindliness. His house was ever open to me, and I could go to him with any petition I wished to make. It is a real pleasure to me to be able publicly once more to thank this worthy man.\nI had been furnished with a letter of recommendation to a certain Herr Palm. The consul kindly sent at once for this gentleman, who soon appeared, and accompanied me to the inn.\nI requested Herr P. to recommend me a servant who could either speak Italian or French, and afterwards to tell me the best method to set about seeing the lions of the town. Herr P. very willingly undertook to do so; and after the lapse of an hour, the dragoman had already been found, and two asses stood before the door to carry me and my servant through the whole town.\nThe animated bustle and hum of business in the streets of Cairo is very great. I can even say that in the most populous cities of Italy I never saw any thing I could compare to it; and certainly this is a bold assertion.\nMany of the streets are so narrow, that when loaded camels meet, one party must always be led into a by-street until the other has passed. In these narrow lanes I continually encountered crowds of passengers, so that I really felt quite anxious, and wondered how I should find my way through. People mounted on horses and donkeys tower above the moving mass; but the asses themselves appear like pigmies beside the high, lofty-looking camels, which do not lose their proud demeanour even under their heavy burdens. Men often slip by under the heads of the camels. The riders keep as close as possible to the houses, and the mass of pedestrians winds dexterously between. There are water-carriers, vendors of goods, numerous blind men groping their way with sticks, and bearing baskets with fruit, bread, and other provisions for sale; numerous children, some of them running about the streets, and others playing before the house-doors; and lastly, the Egyptian ladies, who ride on asses to pay their visits, and come in long processions with their children and negro servants. Let the reader further imagine the cries of the vendors, the shouting of the drivers and passengers, the terrified screams of flying women and children, the quarrels which frequently arise, and the peculiar noisiness and talkativeness of these people, and he can fancy what an effect this must have on the nerves of a stranger. I was in mortal fear at every step, and on reaching home in the evening felt quite unwell; but as I never once saw an accident occur, I at length accustomed myself to the hubbub, and could follow my guide where the crowd was thickest without feeling uneasy.\nThe aspect of this great Egyptian metropolis is not nearly so imposing as I had fancied it to be; its situation is too flat, and from on board we can only discern scattered portions of its extended area. The gardens skirting the shore are luxuriant and lovely.\nAt my debarcation, and on the road to the consulate, I met with several adventures, which I relate circumstantially, trifling as they may appear, in order to give a hint as to the best method of dealing with the people here.\nAt the very commencement I became involved in a dispute with the captain of the vessel.

    "Description":"As we approach Rome the country becomes more and more barren; the mountains recede, and the extended plains have a desert, uncultivated look. Towns and villages become so thinly scattered, that it seems as though the whole region were depopulated. The road is rather narrow, and as the country is in many places exceedingly marshy, a great portion of it has been paved. For many miles before we enter Rome we do not pass a single town or village. At length, some three hours before we reach the city, the dome of St. Peter’s is seen looming in the distance; one church after another appears, and at length the whole city lies spread before us.\nMany ruins of aqueducts and buildings of every kind shewed at every step what treasures of the past here awaited us. I was particularly pleased with the old town-gate Lateran, by which we entered.\nIt was already quite dark when we reached the Dogana. I at once betook myself to my room and retired to rest.\nI remained a fortnight at Rome, and walked about the streets from morning till night. I visited St. Peter’s almost every day, and went to the Vatican several times.\nAll the squares in Rome (and there are a great many) are decorated with fountains, and still more frequently with obelisks. The finest is the Piazza del Popolo. To the right rises the terrace-hill Picino, rich in pillars, statues, fountains, and other ornaments,—a favourite walk of the citizens. On this hill, which is arranged after the manner of a beautiful garden, we have a splendid view. The city of Rome here appears to much greater advantage than when we approach it from the direction of Naples. We can see the whole town at one glance, with the yellow Tiber flowing through the midst, and a vast plain all around. The background is closed by beautiful mountain-ranges, with villas, little towns, and cottages on the declivities. But I missed one feature, to which I had become so accustomed that the most beautiful view appeared incomplete without it—the sea. To make up for this drawback, we here encounter wherever we walk such a number of ruins, that we soon become forgetful of all around us, and live only in the past.\nThe Piazza del Popolo forms the termination of the three principal streets in Rome; on the largest and finest of these, the Corso, many palaces are to be seen.\nThe splendid post-office, of white marble, rises on the Colonna square. Two clocks are erected on this building; one with our dial, one with the Italian. At night both are illuminated,—a very useful as well as an ornamental arrangement. The ancient column of Antoninus also stands in this square.\nThe façade of the Dogana boasts some pillars from the temple of Antonius Pius.\nThe objects I have just enumerated struck me particularly as I wended my way to St. Peter’s. I cannot describe how deeply I was impressed by the sight of this colossal structure. I need only state the fact, that on the first day I entered the cathedral at nine in the morning, and did not emerge from its gates until three in the afternoon.\nI sat down before the pictures in mosaic, underneath the huge dome and the canopy; then I stood before the statues and monuments, and could only gaze in wonder at every thing.\nThe expense of building and decorating this church is said to have amounted to 45,852,000 dollars. It occupies the site of Nero’s circus. Two arcades, with four rows of pillars and ninety-six statues, surround the square leading to the church.\nThe façade of St. Peter’s is decorated with Corinthian pillars, and on its parapet stand statues fifty-two feet in height.\nThe entrance is so crowded with statues, carved work, and gilding, that several hours may be spent in examining its wonders. The traveller’s attention is particularly attracted by the gigantic gates of bronze.\nI cannot adequately describe the splendour of the interior, nor have I seen any thing with which I could compare it.\nThe most beautiful mosaics, monuments, statues, carvings in bronze, gilded ornaments, in short every thing that art can produce, are here to be found in the highest perfection. Oil-paintings alone are excluded. Every thing here is in mosaic; even the cupola displays mosaic work instead of the usual fresco-paintings. Immense statues of white marble occupy the niches.\nBeneath the cupola, the finest portion of the building, stands the great altar, at which none but the Pope may read mass. Over this altar extends a giant canopy of bronze, with spiral pillars richly decorated with arabesques. The weight of metal used in its construction was 186,392 pounds, and the cost of the gold for gilding was 40,000 dollars; the entire canopy is worth above 150,000 dollars. The cupola was executed by Michael Angelo; it rests on four massive pillars, each of them furnished with a balcony. In the interior of these pillars chapels are constructed, where the chief relics are kept, and only displayed to the people from the balcony at particular times. I was in the church at the time when the handkerchief which wiped the drops of agony from our Lord’s brow, and a piece of the true cross, were shewn.\nThe pulpit stands in a very elevated position, and was executed in bronze by Bernini; 219,161 pounds of metal, and 172,000 dollars, were spent upon its construction. In the interior is concealed the wooden pulpit from which St. Peter preached; and immediately beside this we find a pillar of white marble, said to have belonged to Solomon’s temple at Jerusalem.\nThe lions on the monument of Clement XIII., by Canova, are considered the finest that were ever sculptured.\nI was fortunate enough to penetrate into the catacombs of St. Peter’s, a favour which women rarely obtain, and which I only owed to my having been a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. These catacombs consist of handsome passages and pillars of masonry, which do not, however, exceed eight or nine feet in height. A number of sarcophagi, containing the remains of emperors and popes, are here deposited.",

    "Description":"New Orleans is a surprising evidence of what men will endure, when cheered by the hopes of an ever-flowing tide of all-mighty dollars and cents. It is situated on a marsh, and bounded by the river on one side, and on the other by a continuation of the marsh on which it is built, beyond which extends a forest swamp. All sewerage and drainage is superficial—more generally covered in, but in very many places dragging its sluggish stream, under the broad light of day, along the edges of the footway. The chief business is, of course, in those streets skirting the river; and at this season—December—when the cotton and sugar mania is at its height, the bustle and activity is marvellous. Streets are piled in every direction with mounds of cotton, which rise as high as the roofs; storehouses are bursting with bales; steam and hydraulic presses hiss in your ear at every tenth step, and beneath their power the downy fibre is compressed into a substance as hard as Aberdeen granite, which semi-nude negroes bind, roll, and wheel in all directions, the exertion keeping them in perpetual self-supplying animal steam-baths. Gigantic mules arrive incessantly, dragging fresh freight for pressure; while others as incessantly depart, bearing freight for embarkation to Europe..... In the old, or French part, the streets are generally very narrow; but in the American, or the La Fayette quarter, they are very broad, and, whether from indolence or some other reason, badly paved and worse cleansed; nevertheless, if the streets are dirty and muddy, the houses have the advantage of being airy.",

It contains nearly 30,000 inhabitants who 1000 are slaves. Being built upon several hills, it is free from the eternal sameness of level and regularity of lines which tire the eye so much in New York, Philadelphia, &e., and its site resembles more that of Boston or Baltimore. The James River is navigable for small vessels as high as Richmond; but just above the town there is a barrier which arrests alike the navigator's course and the traveller's eye. This barrier is called the Rapids, and is a most beautiful feature in the scenery....There are various public buildings here, among the most conspicuous of which is the Capitol, built in the great public square, and from its summit commanding a splendid panoramic view. There are also about thirty churches, one of which, the Monumental Church—which is Episcopalian—stands upon ground of melancholy recollections; for here, in 1811, stood the theatre, which during that year was utterly consumed by a fire, in which the governor and scores of other human beings perished.",

    "Description":"The stores of the Broadway are the most wonderful glorified shops ever seen. Something between a Manchester warehouse and a London clubhouse. Everybody is talking so much of the rush there will be to the Exhibition in Paris, that we have actually been this day to the Cunard Office, and secured passages back to England, to sail from New York on March 20th; some ten days after which, au revoir. I have spent all my day in going to and fro in Broadway, the wonderful street of New York; in ten years' time the finest street in the world. At present, there are still so many small old houses standing in line with the enormous stores, that the effect is somewhat spoilt, by reason of the ranks not being well dressed. Broadway is now much in the condition of a child's mouth when cutting its second set of teeth; slightly gappy. The enormous stores look even larger now than they will do when the intervals are filled up. The external splendour of the shops is chiefly architectural; they make no great display of goods in the windows; but the large size of the rooms with enables them to set out and exhibit many times the amount of goods that an English shopkeeper shows. The city of New York is on the southern point of Manhattan island; having the East River running along one side, and the North River or Hudson along the other. Some day far in the future, when the present municipality is purged or swept away, and the splendour of the Thames Embankment scheme has been realised, New York will probably have two lines of quays, planted with trees and edged with warehouses, which will make it one of the finest cities in the world. The business quarter is at the point of the peninsula. The fashionable quarter is to the North, reaching every year farther inland. As the city increases, the stores keep moving Northwards, taking possession of the houses, and driving the residents farther back. The land is not yet built over up to Central Park, said to be so called because it will be the future centre of the city that is to be....New York is not a difficult city to find your way about in. Along every Avenue runs a line of Street Cars on an iron tramway. The cars take you for ten cents currency, about fourpence English, from one end of the city to the other. The Avenues are the streets which run the length of the city from North to South, parallel to Broadway; and are called First, Second, Third Avenue, numbering from the East. The streets run at right angles to the Avenues; and are called on the one side of Broadway First, Second, and Third East Street, and on the other side of Broadway First, Second, and Third West Street. The whole city is shaped somewhat like a kite, with Broadway for the wooden rib in the middle. The method and arrangement is admirable, but the rate at which you move on wheels would excite the contempt of a London cabby. There are two Hansome cabs in New York, but they do not take; horses are falling down too much just now.",

    "Description":"Philadelphia is a most difficult town just now for pedestrians, the doorsteps being all of white marble glazed with ice; and sliding on the pavement may be had in perfection. Spent the best part of the day in slipping about, trying to deliver letters of introduction. The system of naming the streets of Philadelphia and of numbering the houses is extremely ingenious, and answers perfectly when you have made yourself acquainted with it; but as it takes an ordinary mind a week to find it out, the stranger who stops four or five days is apt to execrate it. All the streets run at right angles to one another, so that a short cut, the joy of the accomplished Londoner, is impossible. It is a chessboard upon which the Bishop's move is unknown. Nothing diagonal can be done. The city is ruled like a page of a ledger, from top to bottom with streets, from side to side with avenues. It is all divided into squares. When you are first told this, a vision arises of the possibility of cutting across these squares from corner to corner. Not a bit of it—a square at Philadelphia means a solid block of houses, not an open space enclosed by buildings. When you have wandered about for some time, the idea suggests itself that every house is exactly like the house next to it; although the inhabitants have given up the old uniformity of costume, the houses have not; and without this elaborate system of numbering, the inhabitants of Philadelphia would never be able to find their way home. Nevertheless, if that is the finest town in which its inhabitants are best lodged, Philadelphia is the finest town in the world. It lodges a much smaller population than that of New York in more houses. In no other large town are rents comparatively so cheap. Every decent working-man can afford to have his separate house, with gas and water laid on, and fitted with a bath.",

    "Description":"We went this morning over the Capitol, an enormous edifice still in progress; parts of it are continually built on to, and rebuilt, to meet the wants of the legislature. The two new white marble wings are very beautiful, and nearly complete, and the dome is on the same scale with them, and of the same material. The centre is now out of proportion since the wings were built, and is of stone, painted white to match the rest in colour and preserve it from the frost. If the South had succeeded in seceding, it might have sufficed; but now it is bound to grow, and Congress are going to vote the amount of dollars necessary to make the Capitol complete. When completed it will be magnificent. We are very unlucky in seeing these great marble palaces (for several of the public buildings of Washington are of this material) with the snow upon the ground. Against the pure white snow they appear dingy; under a summer sun they must show to far greater advantage. What ancient Athens appeared like, surrounding its marble temples, I can hardly realise; but the effect of the splendid public buildings in Washington is very much detracted from by the sheds and shanties which are near them. The builders of Washington determined that it should be a great city, and staked out its streets accordingly twice the width and length of any other streets: rightly is it named the city of magnificent distances. But although the Potomac is certainly wide enough, and apparently deep enough, to justify a certain amount of trade, and its situation is more central than that of Philadelphia, the town has never grown to fill the outlines traced for it. To make a Washington street, take one marble temple or public office, a dozen good houses of brick, and a dozen of wood, and fill in with sheds and fields. Some blight seems to have fallen upon the city. It is the only place we have seen which is not full of growth and vitality. I have even heard its inhabitants tell stories of nightly pig-hunts in the streets, and of the danger of tumbling over a cow on the pavement on a dark night; but this must refer to bygone times.",

Those we saw consisted of a line of forts, encircling Richmond, earthworks, generally open to the rear, about two miles from the town, and about half a mile apart, each road approaching the town is also protected by earthworks. The most conspicuous weathercock in the town is a golden trumpet on the spire of one of the churches—no bad symbol of beleaguered Richmond, to which the wind brought tidings of war from whichever side it blew. Saw four turkey buzzards sitting on a rail, looking exactly like disreputable turkeys; they are the scavengers of this country. During the war time they are said all to have disappeared from Richmond, there was so much better feasting outside. When the Confederates marched out, the town was set on fire in the tumult. It was nobody's business or care to put it out, and according to our landlord, 1,244 buildings, valued at 3,000,000 dollars, were burnt. About one-half of the space cleared by the fire is now covered again with large handsome stores, said to be double the size of those they replaced. These are being built by Richmond men, but not by the owners of the former stores. Richmond is very different in appearance from any city we have passed through yet; it looks nearly a century older. You see in the suburbs a great many houses which look like the town-residences of well-to-do gentry. Some of these have large Grecian porticoes for shade, and others verandas, story above story, large enough to be in fact a set of open-air summer-rooms, showing that it is hot here sometimes, though cold enough at present.",

We have now glorious summer weather; making us rejoice that we have postponed going north, where all the world is snowed up, and trains are being dug out of the drifts: many stories in the papers also of gales upon the eastern coast, and wrecks about Cape Hatteras, causing me to rejoice that we had not gone south by ship as proposed at one time. As we approached Atlanta the country became more cleared and cultivated. Sixteen miles before reaching it, our eyes were rejoiced by the sight of Stone Mountain, a bare granite bluff, the first hill we have seen in America. The whole coast-line, down which we have travelled, appears to be one level flat. A good deal of stone is being quarried here for the new buildings at Atlanta. The city of Atlanta seems to have no particular natural advantages, but derives its importance from being situated at the junction of four railroads, which run north to Chattanooga, south to Macon, east to Charleston, and west to Montgomery.",

The great devastation was committed by the inhabitants themselves, who now lament bitterly that, in clearing the ground for fortifications which were never used, they cut down the whole of the fine evergreen oaks and magnolias which formerly shaded the suburbs. We were driven to-day along the ‘Shell-road,’ which skirts the western side of the bay. Mobile oysters are beautiful when fried, and after death the shells are made into the smoothest of turnpike roads. Before the war this road ran through a wood of magnificent magnolias, which when in blossom used to fill the air with perfume. The part of the grove next to the town is all swept away, the trees which shaded the citizens' summer evening drive have been felled. Camellias grow here in the gardens, ten feet high; and roses and jonquils are in blossom. Palmettoes grow along the shore, and one house in Government Street had an orange-tree growing on the turf, covered with large dark-red oranges. Several of the best houses in Government Street are said to be tenanted by the former owners of blockade-runners; a trade in which the Jews largely embarked.",

The effect of this metal is even worse than that produced by corrugated iron. If you would insist on metal roofs, they should be of copper, both for durability and beauty. Copper lasts well, and soon takes on a most picturesque olive-green tint. A very striking effect of copper roofing may be realized in a view of Moscow, something very different indeed from that produced by the tin roofing of Quebec. Though I heard nothing but curious English and curious French among the general frequenters of the streets, yet there was something among many of them that reminded one, in their look and gait (though not particularly in their brogue), of Tipperary men.",

    "Description":"The first view of this great city from the river struck me as being flat and smoky, and particularly so as coming immediately after Quebec. But this deficiency in aspect proves its superiority as a living and still growing city, the first sign of which is seen in its magnificent stone quays and its lines of warehouses. The immense quantity of wood, planked and stacked for sale, may be a common feature to a good many persons, but it was most surprising to me. We landed and found our way to the great Windsor Hotel, an enormous house, and here we found evidence of the Parisian having safely arrived before us by the presence of Captain Wylie, looking very bright and jolly, and very glad to see us. At this hotel I first realized the general features of the great hotels of the States, of which I shall have to speak by-and-by, so that I will not enter into particulars on the subject here. And if I were to begin to show how Montreal is a fine large city with fine large buildings, and with a very great number of churches, I might be met with the remark, “Of course it is.” But among the buildings most spoken of, I must confess that the yet incomplete Cathedral of St. Peter presented to me nothing that could recall what it is declared to intend to represent on a somewhat smaller scale—the great Basilica at Rome. If you would desire a fine and impressive view of the city, you must ascend Mont Real (or Mount Royal) behind, and survey the impressive scene, reflecting on all the wealth and commerce that is in active and constant movement among the thousands below, belonging to the largest and most important city of the Dominion. The well-wooded sides of the mountain itself, rising 700 feet above the river, are beautiful. Nor is it possible to overlook in the varied and extensive prospect the vast Victoria Bridge, striding across the river and connecting the city and Lower Canada with the New England States and New York—a connection which formerly was carried on by Lake Champlain and the Hudson. The name of the city as at present written shows a curtailment as well as a corruption of its original one, the full name having been La Ville Marie de Mont Real. But the pronunciation of the name emphasizes the corruption, for the last syllable must be broadened out (as weall know) to “all”—Montreall!",

And if you wish to view a scene of sawing industries that produce all this profusion, go to the Chaudiére, or Caldron Falls, and behold and hear the army of saws that are set in motion by the impatient waters of the Ottawa river, here narrowed by islands to a width of stone two hundred feet, and rushing down for some forty feet over the brows of a rugged slope of rock. This busy, noisy scene of saw and water is sufficiently impressive both to eye and ear, but all the natural wild and boisterous beauty of the Rapids is completely suffocated by the practical uses they are put to. In this point of view, the scene reminded me of Trollhättan Falls, on the river Gotha, Sweden, the wild beauties of which are likewise entirely spoiled by the invasion of the surrounding saw-mills.",

    "Description":"That is a well-known name, and here is the well-known city that owns it. Samuel Rogers, in that somewhat faint but pretty book of his called “Italy,” says that when he waked in Rome he said to himself, “I am at Rome!” Let me be supposed to have said, “I am at Chicago!” The difference, I will confess, is very great, the sentiments aroused very opposite. But in this case Chicago may serve as a foil to the word “Rome,” and thus be all the more vividly shown forth for what it really is. A raw, crowded, noisy, daring, busy, bustling, thriving young republican city, affording a splendid scene and flourish of trumpets for the first drawing up of the curtain of a visit to the States. In this respect it is far more to the purpose than New York, which is upon the sea and at the very doorway of the country; whereas Chicago is some thousand miles inland from that city...As to the teeming city itself, it is in some places scarcely less perplexing than the Board of Trade, and I must leave it to describe itself by its well-known name: it is Chicago. You may readily traverse it, for there is an extensive construction of the endless cable tramway system, the steel rope being in constant movement, and the cars being moved or stopped by clipping or unclipping connection with the chain underneath, in the centre of the road, and running in an open groove. A very large post-office—all in movement, of course—holds its place in the city; and there are wide streets and narrow streets, and large buildings and small buildings; and (while I was there) every sort of advertisement, including, very ostentatiously, those of rival railway companies, competing one against the other at incredibly cheap fares for great distances, such as some of us may remember, but on a somewhat smaller scale, in the early days of our own English railway system. Chicago appears to deal in the superlative in all matters. Some fifty years ago, it was only a small Indian town. Going as far back as 1830, the report I have referred to gives its population as only 70. In 1850, it was 29,963. In 1885, it was estimated at 727,000. And this, in spite of two conflagrations: that of 1871 one of the most destructive on record anywhere. Its grain elevators and depôts are marvels. The water-works have been called one of the wonders of the world, and its parks are of magnificent extent. They are ten in number, and contain altogether more than 2000 acres, with many miles of carriage drives, besides those along the extensive boulevards. It claims to be the third manufacturing city in the States; stands next to New York in general commercial importance; and to be the greatest grain, live-stock, and lumber market in the world. Yet, says the report, “considering what must be the development of the vast States and Territories, not yet really populated, which must depend on Chicago for the outlet of their produce, we must stand amazed at the future which is spread out before this favoured city situated at the head of a mighty chain of inland seas a highway along which to distribute the multiform products of an immense region, and by which in return to supply the varied wants of an increasing civilisation.” Already twenty-six railways converge in the city.",

    "Description":"In speaking of St. Paul, I must combine with it Minneapolis, at a few miles distant, both being in the State of Minnesota; the former its capital city, and both rival and rapidly advancing cities, at rather more than fourteen hundred miles from New York. The rapidity of the growth of these two cities, as officially reported, seems incredible. In 1860, the total population of the two was but 16,222; in 1884, it had grown to little short of 200,000; when I was there, each was claiming 150,000. There are only ten miles between them, and, in spite of their rivalry, a junction is predicted of the two into one. Anything in the shape of development appears to be possible in the States. The Americans have not only introduced new modes of spelling words, but they have given them a new meaning, and a very extended one in this instance. Nature, in the States, has permitted the junction of two elements which she has been justly charged with denying in other regions: a strong race with a strong land. Here she can give all she is properly asked for, and she is tolerably sure of being asked for everything she has to give. That by-and-by she will have a great many more to give to than she has now on her hands out here is a matter which must be left to the future to take care of. Both cities are on the Mississippi, which, in Indian language, signifies “The Father of Waters;” but it struck me that Minneapolis is the better placed of the two, because it can make more use of the mighty river than St. Paul can. I allude to the water-power at what are called the Falls of St. Anthony. It is round these falls that are constructed the gigantic flour-mills of Messrs. Pilsbury, which form the chief sight at Minneapolis, and where again figures of millions are put forward. In 1879, the millers there manipulated 7,514,364 bushels of wheat; and in 1885, the returns gave 32,112,840. Another calculation for 1885 is that the mills together are capable of delivering 33,973 barrels (of 60 lb.) per day; an amount said to be equal to the day's necessities of one-half of the population of Great Britain.",

    "Description":"The enormous extent of the white formation, and the grouping of the projections whence the geysers from time to time play, must be unique in the world. All lies in front of the hotel, and it involves a very long walk to visit all the surface. The geysers, large and small, extending over this (so to speak) white territory, are said to be fifty in number; the large ones bear the several curious names of Old Faithful, the Bee-Hive, Castle, Splendid, Grand, Giantess, Giant, Lion, Lioness and Cubs, etc., etc. But herein. lies the great disappointment and drawback: they never go off altogether except in a picture. You may even lose days to see nothing but: the ridiculously named “Old Faithful;” and thus the impression of this visit to what we are told is the “grandest country, spectacularly, God Almighty has made,” and that it is “the Supreme Builder's own design and completion,” turns out disappointing. For our own part, we were not over-fortunate; Old Faithful, of course, we saw, for he goes off every seventy minutes or so, and is scarcely five minutes from the hotel. He is the mainstay of the visit, and yet, if you want to see the others, he at last begins to be almost a sort of nuisance. For ourselves, the first thing we heard on our arrival was that the Castle had just gone off, “about an hour ago,” and that the Grand had played “yesterday.” On the Saturday morning we were told that the Grand and the Giant had both been playing in the night; while the Beehive was disappointing everybody, as it had never been quiet for so long an interval. All that was accorded to us was a sudden call at supper on this last day, when some one came rushing in to say the large Cub had begun, and that the little one and the Lioness were sure to follow. And so they did; but the Lioness gave little more than a growl and lay down again, while the Cubs only behaved like cubs.",

I have certainly seen, in reality, a city trying to begin, and already the hotel, only partly built, is called “The Royal.” There is also a newspaper, and there are stores. Plenty of the well-known corrugated iron is converted into use, if not beauty. I verily believe, from all I could gather, that this spot, situated as it is in the northwest of Canada, with almost unbounded capacities for corn and cattle around, is destined to become the focus of an immense thriving population. The grazing lands are spoken of as embracing four thousand square miles. Cattle already abound. The beef I ate from the rude kitchen was excellent. Americans are coming in to secure land, and on the very day I was there one of them arrived for the purpose of “locating” five hundred\n horses. They have not yet any great building which they call their Law Courts, and if they\n cannot have anything better than the cumbrous and inconvenient lump of ugliness that\n now adorns the neighbourhood of our Temple Bar, God forbid they ever should have!",

    "Description":"At about twelve miles above the confluence with the Columbia, on the west bank, Portland is finely situated, and no other city can more vividly exemplify the effects of railway development. In the year 1870 it contained a population of only 1100; by 1880, as a result of the construction of the eastern section of the Northern Pacific line, and the approaching completion of the great transcontinental system, the number had increased to 23,000. But in 1883 the population was given as nearly 40,000. Although one hundred miles from the coast, Portland is virtually a seaport, and vessels of 3000 tons may be seen loading at its wharfs; and in the busy season a perfect fleet of merchantmen is employed in shipping the great wheat crop of Oregon to Europe. The trade in tinned salmon from the Columbia is also very large; but, considering the immense destruction that is going on amidst the almost fabulous abundance of this fish in all these western waters, it seems possible that this item of commerce may not be continuously so extensive. Its position is attractive and picturesque. “It is a novel experience,” writes Mr. Fee in his pamphlet, from which some of these particulars are taken, “to stand in the primæval forest which hugs the city closely on all sides, and look down upon the bustling activity of trade and pleasure. Here are the tall pines and the dark thicket; there the masts, the smoky chimneys, and the dusty streets.” From Robinson's Hill the view comprises the rivers and all the five mountains: Mounts Jefferson and Hood, in Oregon, and, to the north, Mounts Adams and St. Helen's, with Tacoma at a greater distance. There are many resident thriving merchants, whose villas bespeak their wealth and adorn the suburbs. The climate is commendable as partaking of the softness of the Pacific, in contrast with the harshness of the Atlantic Ocean; and it is customary to compare the two Portlands in this respect. Portland in Maine is of rather a lower latitude than Portland in Oregon, the former standing at about 43° north, and the latter at about 46°. But the difference between the two climates, in favour of the latter, is so marked, and was so often mentioned to me, that I offered the following distich:— While Portland, Maine, lies wrapt in snow, In Portland, Oregon, the roses blow.",

We here experienced many acts of kindness and assistance from Capt. C. M. Wade, the political agent, whose good offices I have to acknowledge with gratitude. The society of this, the most remote station of British India, also evinced an interest in our welfare which was truly gratifying. We took leave of it at a convivial party given for the occasion on the 2d of January, and on the following day bade a long farewell to such scenes, and plunged into the solitude of an Indian desert.We took the route that leads along the left bank of the Sutlege, till that river is joined by the Beas or Hyphasis.",

There they are known under the various denominations of Dogur, Julmairee, Salairee, &c. and by the general designation of Raat, and live in a perpetual state of opposition to one another. In the cultivated parts this country has the appearance of an extensive meadow. It is entirely free from underwood, and some of the wheat fields extend for miles without a hedge. The grain is raised without irrigation, though the water is but twenty-six feet from the surface. There are no trees except in the vicinity of the villages; and such is the scarcity of fuel, that cow dung is universally used in its stead. This is dried and stacked. The fire formed of it throws out a most powerful heat, which leaves the people no cause to regret the want of other fuel. The country below that stripe which fringes the river is known by the name of Malwa. It has a dry climate and soil, and produces gram and barley, with bajree and mut, which are exported to the Punjab.",

Herds of neelgaee roam over it. Ancient canals.In former years the Mogul emperors, seeing the comparative sterility of this tract, fertilised it by canals from the Ravee, which connected that river with the Beas. The remains of one of them may be yet traced at the town of Puttee, running down at right angles upon the Beas, though it has been choked up for the last 150 years.

The walks of the garden were lined with beautiful cypresses and weeping willows; and in the flower-beds were the narcissus, and rose-bushes of the “sidburg,” or an hundred leaves. Most of the trees and flowers are indigenous, but many had been introduced from Cashmeer; and a native of that valley was the gardener. The proprietor of this pleasant spot was absent: his villa was in disorder, and much neglected, since he is suffering from the avarice of his ruler. His son, a sharp boy of nine years old, paid us a visit, and repeated some lines of a Persian poet which he was reading at school.

    "Description":"At the village of Keora, five miles from Pind Dadun Khan, we examined one of the principal mines. It was situated near the outside of the range, in a valley, which was cut by a rivulet of salt water. It opened into the hill through the red clayey formation above mentioned, at a distance of about 200 feet from the base. We were conducted by a narrow gallery, sufficient to admit of one person passing another, for about 350 yards, of which fifty may be taken as actual descent. Here we entered a cavern of irregular dimensions, and about 100 feet high, excavated entirely in salt. The mineral is deposited in strata of the utmost regularity, occurring, like the external rock, in vertical layers. Some of them, however, subtend an angle of from twenty to thirty degrees, and have the same appearance as bricks that have been placed upon one another. None of the layers exceed a foot and a half in thickness, and each is distinctly separated from its neighbour by a deposit of argillaceous earth about an eighth of an inch thick, which lies like mortar between the strata. Some of the salt occurs in hexagonal crystals, but oftener in masses: the whole of it is tinged with red, varying from the slightest shade to the deepest hue; when pounded, the salt is white. The temperature of the cavern exceeded that of the open air by twenty degrees, where the thermometer stood at sixty-four (in February). The natives state that these mines are much colder in the hot season; but this only shows that they undergo little or no alteration, while the heat outside alters with the season. There was no moist feeling, which one might have expected in a salt mine",

The husbandmen were mowing down the green wheat for the use of their cattle. The salt range runs parallel with the river, and presents a perfect contrast of desolation to its fertile valley; for it has no vegetation. Villages.Many villages, however, are perched upon the outer hills, which rise over one another in a picturesque manner. Nor are they more remarkable for their romantic situation than their comfort. We halted at one of them, which was neat and well kept, and lodged in a room which was about sixteen feet long, and half that breadth. It had cupboards and shelves, while the magazines for grain, which are formed[57] of earth, answered the purposes of tables. The whole buildings, both inside and out, are plastered with a grey-coloured earth, which gives them a cleanly appearance; and since these villages stand on the declivity of the hills, the rain washes down all that is disagreeable with it.",

As we wound through the dismal defiles, and might be ruminating on the various expeditions which had traversed this very road, the fort burst upon our view like the scene of a magic lantern. It had been hidden from us by towering precipices. We approached its ponderous walls by a straggling path which time had chiselled in the rock, and soon reached its lofty gateway. The black hoary aspect of the fort, and the arid sterility of the surrounding rocks, inspired us with no favourable idea of the neighbourhood, which has been the resort of many a desperate band. We had omitted to provide ourselves with Runjeet Sing’s order for admission into this fortress; but we proceeded to the gateway, as a matter of course, and after a parley the doors were thrown open. The official permission arrived from Lahore on the following day.",

At the bottom is the river, which comes from the right from behind a very bold hanging wood, that seems to unite with the hill on the opposite shore. At this pass the river fills the vale, but it widens by degrees, and presents various reaches, intermixed with little tufts of trees. The bridge we passed over is half hid. Innisteague is mixed with them, and its buildings backed by a larger wood, give variety to the scene.

When two bits of these basalts are rubbed together quick, they emit a considerable scent like burnt leather. The scenery of the Causeway, nor of the adjacent mountains, is very magnificent, though the cliffs are bold; but for a considerable distance there is a strong disposition in the rocks to run into pentagonal cylinders, and even at a bridge by Mr. Lesly’s is a rock in which the same disposition is plainly visible.

We carried provisions with us and Keats's poems. The morning was one of the brightest and hottest that August ever bestowed, and it required some resolution to trudge along the shadeless chaussee, which formed the first two or three miles of our way. One compensating pleasure was the sight of the beautiful mountain-ashes in full berry which, alternately with cherry trees, border\n the road for a considerable distance. I felt a child's love for the bunches of coral standing out against the blue sky. The Schloss is a house of very moderate size, and no pretension of any kind. Two flights of steps lead up to the door, and the balustrades are ornamented with beautiful creepers. A tiny sort of piazza under the steps is ornamented with creepers too, and has pretty earthenware vases filled with plants hanging from the ceiling.\n We felt how much beauty might be procured at small expense in looking at these things. A beautiful walk through a beechwood took us to the Mooshütte, before which stands the beech whereon Goethe and his friends cut their names, and from which Goethe denounced Waldemar. We could recognize some of the initials.",

In each room there is the bust of the poet who is its presiding genius; and the walls of the Goethe and Schiller rooms are decorated with frescoes, representing scenes from their works. The Wieland room is decorated with arabesques only. The idea of these rooms is a very pretty one, but the frescoes are badly executed.",

Very interesting it is to see his study, which is happily left in its original state. In his bedroom we saw his skull for the first time, and were amazed at the smallness of the intellectual region. There is an intensely interesting sketch of Schiller lying dead, which I saw for the first time in the study; but all pleasure in thinking of Schiller's portraits and bust is now destroyed to me by the conviction of their untruthfulness. Rauch told us that he had a miserable Stirne. Waagen says that Tieck the sculptor told him there was something in Schiller's whole person which reminded him of a camel.",

    "Description":"Goethe's house is much more important-looking, but, to English eyes, far from being the palatial residence which some German writers think it. The entrance-hall is certainly rather imposing, with its statues in niches and broad staircase. The latter was made after his own design, and was an \"after-shine\" of Italian tastes. The pictures are wretched, the casts not much better — indeed, I remember nothing which seemed intrinsically worth looking at. The MS. of his \"Römische Elegien,\"\n written by himself in the Italian character, is to be seen here; and one likes to look at it better than at most of the other things. G. had obtained permission from Frau v. Goethe to see the studio and Schlafzimmer, which are not open to the public, and here our feelings were deeply moved. We entered first a small room containing drawers and shelves devoted to his mineralogical collections. From these we passed into the study. It is rather a dark room, for there are only two small windows — German windows. A plain deal table stands in the middle, and near the chair, against this table, is a high basket, where, I was afterwards told, Goethe used to put his pocket-handkerchief. A long sort of writing-table and bookcase united stands against one wall. Here hangs the pin-cushion, just as he left it, with visiting-cards suspended on threads, and other trifles which greatness and death have made sacred. Against the opposite wall, where you enter the bedroom, there is a high writing-desk, on which stands a little statue of Napoleon in creamy glass. The bedroom is very small. By the side of the bed stands a stuffed armchair, where he used to sit and read while he drank his coffee in the morning.\n It was not until very late in his life that he adopted the luxury of an armchair. From the other side of the study one enters the library, which is fitted up in a very makeshift fashion, with rough deal shelves, and bits of paper, with Philosophy, History, etc., written on them to mark the classification of the books. Among such memorials one breathes deeply, and the tears rush to one's eyes. \n There is one likeness of Goethe that is really startling and thrilling from the idea it gives one of perfect resemblance. It is painted on a cup, and is a tiny miniature, but the execution is so perfect that, on applying a magnifying glass, every minute stroke has as natural an appearance as the texture of a flower or the parts of an insect under the microscope.",

    "Description":"There are certain persons without any physiognomy,the catalogue of whose features, as item a Roman nose, item a pair Gf black eyes, etc., gives you the entire contents of their faces. There is no difference of opinion about the looks of such people. All the world is agreed either that they are pretty or ugly. So it is with Berlin. Every one tells you it is an uninteresting modern city, with broad, monotonous streets; and when you see it, you cannot for the life of you get up an emotion of surprise, or make a remark about the place which you have not heard before.\n The day after our arrival was Sunday, 6th November: the sun shone brightly, and we went to walk in the Linden, elbowing our way among the promeneurs endimanchés, who looked remarkably smart and handsome after the Thuringians. ...\n [...]\n They were very happy months we spent at Berlin, in spite of the bitter cold which came on in January and lasted almost till we left. How we used to rejoice in the idea of our warm room and coffee as we battled our way from dinner against the wind and snow! Then came the delightful long evening, in which we read Shakespeare, Goethe, Heine, and Macaulay, with German Pfefferkuchen and Semmels at the end to complete the noctes cenoeque deûm.\n We used often to turn out for a little walk in the evening, when it was not too cold, to refresh ourselves by a little pure air as a change from the stove-heated room. Our favourite walk was along the Linden, in the broad road between the trees. We used to pace to old Fritz's monument, which loomed up dark and mysterious against the sky. Once or twice we went along the gaslighted walk towards Kroll's. One evening in our last week, we went on to the bridge leading to the Friedrichstadt, and there by moon- and gas-light saw the only bit of picturesqueness Berlin afforded us. The outline of the Schloss towards the water is very varied, and a light in one of the windows near the top of a tower was a happy accident. The row of houses on the other side of\n the water was shrouded in indistinctness, and no ugly object marred the scene. The next day, under the light of the sun, it was perfectly prosaic.",

    "Description":"We anchored in the open roadstead of Horta, half a mile from the shore. The town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear to their summits—not a foot of soil left idle. Every farm and every acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow there. These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.\n The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguese characteristics about it. But more of that anon. A swarm of swarthy, noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship’s sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of any country. We landed under the walls of a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders, which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it. The group on the pier was a rusty one—men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars. They trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. It was very flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation. Here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on. This hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is unfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a woman’s head is hidden away in it like the man’s who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. There is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote, as they call it—it is just a plain, ugly dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can’t go within eight points of the wind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all. The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.",

    "Description":"We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the African one, “Ape’s Hill,” a grand old mountain with summit streaked with granite ledges, was in sight. The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar, was yet to come. The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head of navigation and the end of the world. The information the ancients didn’t have was very voluminous. Even the prophets wrote book after book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at the existence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they must have known it was there, I should think.\n In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by the sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar. There could not be two rocks like that in one kingdom.\n The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by 1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base. One side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the side of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep slant which an army would find very difficult to climb. At the foot of this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar—or rather the town occupies part of the slant. Everywhere—on hillside, in the precipice, by the sea, on the heights—everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad with masonry and bristling with guns. It makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it. It is pushed out into the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of a “gob” of mud on the end of a shingle. A few hundred yards of this flat ground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across the strip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of a mile, comes the “Neutral Ground,” a space two or three hundred yards wide, which is free to both parties.",

We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present. Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time. Elsewhere we have found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but always with things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, and so the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force. We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign—foreign from top to bottom—foreign from center to circumference—foreign inside and outside and all around—nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness—nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! In Tangier we have found it. Here is not the slightest thing that ever we have seen save in pictures—and we always mistrusted the pictures before. We cannot anymore. The pictures used to seem exaggerations—they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality. But behold, they were not wild enough—they were not fanciful enough—they have not told half the story. Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save The Arabian Nights. Here are no white men visible, yet swarms of humanity are all about us. Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old. All the houses nearly are one-and two-story, made of thick walls of stone, plastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as a floor on top, no cornices, whitewashed all over—a crowded city of snowy tombs! And the doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; the floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated, many-colored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and broad bricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (of Jewish dwellings) save divans—what there is in Moorish ones no man may know; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter. And the streets are oriental—some of them three feet wide, some six, but only two that are over a dozen; a man can blockade the most of them by extending his body across them. Isn’t it an oriental picture?",

    "Description":"We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame. We had heard of it before. It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are. We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment; it was like the pictures. We stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages. The Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris. These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew’s Massacre, and they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day—and they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins. I wish these old parties could speak. They could tell a tale worth the listening to. / They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago—remains of it are still preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100. The ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time, one would think. One portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times. It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest—he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans. Alas! Those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church. / The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars. They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential power—but precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again! And they did. / We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns. We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the Azores, but no nails. They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter. His noble effort cost him his life. He was shot dead. They showed us a cast of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it lodged. These people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics. Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention.",

    "Description":"Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret. We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody. / On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it—mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help. A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face. We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss. We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain. I half feared that the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred. Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look—people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night.",

    "YearOfTravel":1869,
    "Description":"One of our pleasantest visits was to Pere la Chaise, the national burying-ground of France, the honored resting-place of some of her greatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious men and women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their own energy and their own genius. It is a solemn city of winding streets and of miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from out a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers. Not every city is so well peopled as this, or has so ample an area within its walls. Few palaces exist in any city that are so exquisite in design, so rich in art, so costly in material, so graceful, so beautiful. / We had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marble effigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at length upon the tombs, and the sensations invoked were startling and novel; the curious armor, the obsolete costumes, the placid faces, the hands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplication—it was a vision of gray antiquity. It seemed curious enough to be standing face to face, as it were, with old Dagobert I., and Clovis and Charlemagne, those vague, colossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a thousand years ago! I touched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but Dagobert was deader than the sixteen centuries that have passed over him, Clovis slept well after his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on dreaming of his paladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me. / The great names of Pere la Chaise impress one, too, but differently. There the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is, that this place is sacred to a nobler royalty—the royalty of heart and brain. Every faculty of mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupation which men engage in, seems represented by a famous name. The effect is a curious medley. / Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battle tragedy, are here, and so also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimic tragedy on the stage. The Abbe Sicard sleeps here—the first great teacher of the deaf and dumb—a man whose heart went out to every unfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service; and not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal Ney, whose stormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms. The man who originated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introduced the cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving countrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens and princes of Further India. Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace the astronomer, Larrey the surgeon, de Suze the advocate, are here, and with them are Talma, Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger; Moliere and Lafontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whose worthy labors are as familiar in the remote by-places of civilization as are the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marble vaults of St. Denis. / But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, there is one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by without stopping to examine. Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea of the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but not one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and its romantic occupants. This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise—a grave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written and sung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other in Christendom save only that of the Saviour. All visitors linger pensively about it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes of it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come there to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken lovers make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail and “grit” their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase the sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of immortelles and budding flowers. / Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb. Go when you will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles. Go when you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supply the deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections have miscarried.",

    "Description":"VERSAILLES! It is wonderfully beautiful! You gaze and stare and try to understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not the Garden of Eden—but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite dream. The scene thrills one like military music! A noble palace, stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed that it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies of an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over the ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from the promenade to lower grounds of the park—stairways that whole regiments might stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whose great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty; wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled all the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were carved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with miniature ships glassed in their surfaces. And every where—on the palace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the trees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues—hundreds and hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to the fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it could have lacked. / It was worth a pilgrimage to see. Everything is on so gigantic a scale. Nothing is small—nothing is cheap. The statues are all large; the palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are interminable. All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles are vast. I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and these dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be. I know now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it is in reality. I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now. He took a tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris. He kept 36,000 men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night. The wife of a nobleman of the time speaks of this as an “inconvenience,” but naively remarks that “it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of tranquillity we now enjoy.”",

    "Description":"[Trigger Warning]\n \n By whom this New Plymouth (situated, according to Captain Jones his computation, in 41 degrees and 48 minutes) is now presently inhabited, your Lordship and the honorable Company do know better than myself. For whom how favourably God’s providence in thought and in deed, quite besides any plot or design of theirs, hath wrought, especially in the beginning of their enterprise, is worthy to be observed. For when, as your Lordship knows, their voyage was intended for Virginia, being by letters from Sir Edwin Sandys and Mr. Deputy Ferrar recommended to Sir Yeardley (then Governor) that he should give them the best advice he could for trading in Hudson’s River, whether it were by contrariety of wind or by the backwardness of their master or pilot to make (as they thought it) too long a journey, they fell short both of the one and the other, arriving first at that stately harbour called Cape Cod, called by Indians “Pamet”; from whence in shallop the pilot, a more forward undertaker than performer, promised to bring them to be seated in a pleasant and fertile place called Anquam, situate within Cape Ann, about forty leagues from Plymouth. After some dangerous and almost incurable errors and mistakings, he stumbled by accident upon the harbour of Plymouth; where, after the planters had failed of their intention, and the pilot of his, it pleased Almighty God (who had better provided for them than their own hearts could imagine) to plant them on the seat of an old town which divers [years] before had been abandoned of the Indians. So they both quietly and justly sate down without either dispossessing any of the natives, or being resisted by them, and without shedding so much as one drop of blood. Which felicity of theirs is confirmed unto them even by the voices of the savages themselves, who generally do acknowledge not only the seat, but the whole seigniory thereto belonging, to be, and do themselves disclaim all title from it; so that the right of those planters to it is altogether unquestionable—a favor which, since the first discovery of America, God hath not vouchsafed, so far as ever I could learn, upon any Christian nation within that continent. Yet can it not be denied but that these of the Summer Islands are blessed with the same privilege according to the saying of St. Paul, “If the firstfruits be holy, the lump is also holy.”",

The land is in many places good, and fit for plowing and sowing. It has many fine valleys, where there is good grass. Their form of government is like that of their neighbors, which is described hereafter.\n \n [Probably the Kill van Kull and the Passaic or Hackensack River was thought to connect with the Wallkill River and Rondout Creek]",

It is inhabited by the old Manhattans; they are about two hundred to three hundred strong, women and men, under different chiefs, whom they call Sackimas. This island is more mountainous than the other land on the southeast side of the river, which opposite to the Manhattas is about a league and a half in breadth. At the side of the before-mentioned little river, which we call “Achter Col,” there is a great deal of waste reedy land; the rest is full of trees, and in some places there is good soil, where the savages plant their maize, upon which they live, as well as by hunting. The other side of the same small river, according to conjecture, is about 20 to 23 leagues broad to the South River,[140] in the neighborhood of the Sancicans, in so far as I have been able to make it out from the mouths of the savages; but as they live in a state of constant enmity with those tribes, the paths across are but little used, wherefore I have not been able to learn the exact distance; so that when we wish to send letters overland, they (the natives) take their way across the bay, and have the letters carried forward by others, unless one amongst them may happen to be on friendly terms, and who might venture to go there.",

It is about seven leagues in circumference, full of trees, and in the middle rocky to the extent of about two leagues in circuit. The north side has good land in two places, where two farmers, each with four horses, would have enough to do without much clearing at first. The grass is good in the forest and valleys, but when made into hay is not so nutritious for the cattle as here,[141] in consequence of its wild state, but it yearly improves by cultivation. On the east side there rises a large level field, of from 70 to 80 morgens of land,[142] 68 through which runs a very fine fresh stream; so that that land can be plowed without much clearing. It appears to be good. The six farms, four of which lie along the River Hellgate,[143] stretching to the south side of the island, have at least 60 morgens of land ready to be sown with winter seed, which at the most will have been plowed eight times. But as the greater part must have some manure, inasmuch as it is so exhausted by the wild herbage, I am afraid that all will not be sown; and the more so, as the managers of the farms are hired men. The two hindermost farms, Nos. 1 and 2, are the best; the other farms have also good land, but not so much, and more sandy; so that they are best suited for rye and buckwheat.",

    "Description":"From Aptucxet the English can come in six hours, through 75 the woods, passing several little rivulets of fresh water, to New Plymouth, the principal place in the district Patuxet, so called in their patent from His Majesty in England.\n \n [...]\n \n At the south side of the town there flows down a small river of fresh water, very rapid, but shallow, which takes its rise from several lakes in the land above, and there empties into the sea; where in April and the beginning of May, there come so many shad from the sea which want to ascend that river, that it is quite surprising. This river the English have shut in with planks, and in the middle with a little door, which slides up and down, and at the sides with trellice work, through which the water has its course, but which they can also close with slides.\n \n At the mouth they have constructed it with planks, like an eel-pot, with wings, where in the middle is also a sliding door, and with trellice work at the sides, so that between the two [dams] there is a square pool, into which the fish aforesaid come swimming in such shoals, in order to get up above, where they deposit their spawn, that at one tide there are 10,000 to 12,000 fish in it, which they shut off in the rear at the ebb, and close up the trellices above, so that no more water comes in; then the water runs out through the lower trellices, and they draw out the fish with baskets, each according to the land he cultivates, and carry them to it, depositing in each hill three or four fishes, and in these they plant their maize, which grows as luxuriantly therein as though it were the best manure in the world. And if they do not lay this fish therein, the maize will not grow, so that such is the nature of the soil.\n \n New Plymouth lies on the slope of a hill stretching east towards the sea-coast, with a broad street about a cannon shot of 800 feet long, leading down the hill; with a [street] crossing in the middle, northwards to the rivulet and southwards to the land. The houses are constructed of clapboards, with gardens also enclosed behind and at the sides with clapboards, so that their houses and courtyards are arranged in very good order, with a stockade against sudden attack; and at the ends of the streets there are three wooden gates. In the center, on the cross street, stands the Governor’s house, before which is a square stockade upon which four patereros are mounted, so as to enfilade the streets. Upon the hill they have a large square house, with a flat roof, built of thick sawn planks stayed with oak beams, upon the top of which they have six cannon, which shoot iron balls of four and five pounds, and command the surrounding country. The lower part they use for their church, where they preach on Sundays and the usual holidays. They assemble by beat of drum, each with his musket or firelock, in front of the captain’s door; they have their cloaks on, and place themselves in order, three abreast, and are led by a sergeant without beat of drum. Behind comes the Governor, in a long robe; beside him on the right hand, comes the preacher with his cloak on, and on the left hand, the captain with his side-arms and cloak on, and with a small cane in his hand; and so they march in good order, and each sets his arms down near him. Thus they are constantly on their guard night and day.",

The Viceroy found the Licentiate Pedro Ramirez de Quiñones, now Judge of the Confines, in Panama. He was taking the residencia of Dr Villalobos and the Licentiate Paez, who had been Judges of the Court established in that kingdom. Presently the Viceroy took the royal seal, and placed it in a box with the veneration which was its due, with several chapters of the Ordinances[3],{3} intending to carry out the orders literally. They required that all the men and women of Peru should be sent to their native homes at the cost of those who possessed them, it being the will of the King that they should be free, as his subjects and vassals[5]. Notwithstanding that the order was just and righteous, some of the Indians evaded it because they were married, others because they liked their masters and were tolerably instructed in the matters of our Holy Catholic Faith. Even of those who were ordered to depart many merely went to hide in secret places so as not to go whither they were sent, and others went to the churches, whence they were taken by order of the Viceroy, and put on board ships, where many died. So that very few returned to their native places, and those that did went back to the rites and idolatries they had formerly been accustomed to. There was thus no benefit derived from compliance with this ordinance. Some Spanish conquerors, who returned to Spain, had lived with Indian women for many years, and had children by them. These were to be sent to the native places of the mothers at the cost of their masters. If they disputed or complained they had to pay double for freight and passage. Some had small children and prayed that they might not be sent to die owing to having no mothers. These were ordered to pay a still larger sum.",

He accomplished the journey and was publicly well received, but really, at the bottom of their hearts, every one was sorry to see him, because he brought the new laws. Finally he was received as Viceroy, and at once began to enforce the ordinances. He ordered a copy to be made of the grants of Indians within the boundaries of San Miguel, asking the Caciques how many they had given, and the Encomenderos how many they had received, according to which he assessed the tribute which had to be paid. He then gave the Indians to understand that his Majesty ordered that they were to be free, and to be treated as his vassals.\n \n The members of the municipality of that city, seeing how the Viceroy enforced the ordinances, entreated him not to do so at once, but to give time for the Emperor to be informed generally of the state of the kingdom that, in consideration of the great service performed for his Majesty, he might deign to show mercy and not to insist on the ordinances being enforced in their entirety. Although they supplicated in great sorrow, holding up their right hand in testimony that they would always serve the King with loyalty, their prayers availed nothing, nor the protests and representations they made.

I am myself a witness as regards one chief, for I scolded him and he confessed that he had sacrificed a woman, and seeing this I could not but feel it much. For to have the Indians subject to our holy catholic faith, and gentle and domestic as regards our evangel and Christianity is not to deprive them of liberty, but rather to give them that liberty that Christus liberavit nos not to make them slaves.

    "Description":"When I arrived at Lima my sorrow increased to find that all the labours of the past had only brought trouble all over the country and no peace. The Viceroy, on landing, at once began to enforce the laws and ordinances, refusing to concede anything to the supplications. The consequence was that the whole country rose when he reached Lima, where they received him very unwillingly. When the news came to Cuzco that he would consider no supplication, the people rose against the person of the Viceroy, and took up arms, saying that they would come to protest against the new laws, and they chose Gonzalo Pizarro for their captain. The Viceroy, knowing this, began to collect troops. When I arrived I saw that the troops were disorderly. Presently the Viceroy ordered 150,000 castellanos, which Vaca de Castro had on board ship for despatch to your Majesty, to be landed. He spent it all on his troops for hosen, doublets and other clothes. But though he paid them well, he did not gain the good will of fifty, as was seen afterwards. When the three{135} Judges arrived, who had been left at Panama, they considered it advisable to suspend the new laws so as to quiet and pacify the land. But this did no good. It was too late. The people said that it should have been done before.",

They ordered a banner to be displayed, and caused it to be proclaimed that all should be on the side of his Majesty and his Royal Court of Justice. They came to the great square with this proclamation, and marched towards the troops of the Viceroy who were in front of his house. As the Judges approached, the Viceroy’s troops fired their arquebuses in the air, threw up their pikes and all went over to the side of the Judges. The people then entered the Viceroy’s house and arrested him without anyone being killed or wounded, or a drop of blood shed. It was all done so quietly that it appeared to me as if it had been arranged beforehand. It was either a miracle or I cannot understand it. It is beyond me that a Viceroy, having so many troops, should have been arrested and no one hurt. He was delivered to the Judges who sent him as a prisoner to the house of one of them, and thence he was taken to an island[64] near the port, until they could send him in a ship to Spain as a prisoner.",

There were very heavy seas, thunder and lightning, and a downpour of rain, wet through fore and aft. Those with him entreated him to let the captain shorten sail. He refused. At last he went to his cabin to see how his papers had fared with the water. Then Paredes and others told the sailors that I had ordered the mainsail to be lowered. Having done my best to protect the papers from wet, I came out and found the men on the yard and the sail being lowered. I shouted that it was not to be done, but no one wanted to hear me. At this juncture a number of lights of St Elmo appeared on all the yards, which gave great consolation, all the sailors falling on their knees and saying their St Elmo prayer. This led to silence, and I and Pedro de Hinojosa, with some others, got the sail up again. This reminded me of what Aristotle and Pliny said that when there are many of these lights, it is a sign that the tempest will cease. Next day we were able to anchor under the shelter of Gorgona. Don Pedro Cabrera’s ship reached Buenaventura, where he and his people landed and marched by Popayan and Quito, reaching Xauxa after seven months, in November. I found 12 ships at Gorgona. The Bishop of Lima, Hinojosa, and Paredes went in the galliot. April 30th all sailed from Gorgona, I also in the galley with 30 of the best arquebusiers, to go by rowing if sails were of no use. Paniagua met me off Gallo with a letter from Gonzalo Pizarro. He dwelt on the services of his brothers and himself, on the necessity for expelling Blasco Nuñez, and on his care of the royal treasury.",

They asked me if it was I who had put up the flag which I mentioned before. I said yes and that I had hoisted it as a signal that I came on an errand of peace. They answered that it was a great piece of insolence for anyone to hoist a flag in the territory of the Inca, and if it had not been that the Inca had given orders for me to enter, they would have killed me there and then. Each{176} one then began to brandish his arms, calling the Spaniards bearded cowards and thieves. Others said, “May we not kill this little bearded one, to avenge what his brethren have done to us.” I appeased them by saying it was true than when the Spaniards came they did much harm; but that now there was justice, that the people were favoured and had their liberty. They then asked me if I was one of those who came first, or whether I had arrived recently. I answered that it was seventeen years since I came from Spain, that in all times there were some good and some bad, and that now they deserved much honour for it seemed to me that they were good men. As to what others had done, the fault did not lie with me. I then gave them some drink, and I gave some of them needles, ornaments, knives, and other things, so we made friends. I then wrote to the Inca to say that I had entered his country, but had not yet come to where he was, and that in token of friendship I sent him two glass jars and two dozen buttons of green glass that looked like emeralds.",

The Indians told me that those Spaniards had killed him to raise the land, and that they determined to kill him while playing at la herradura. One Mendez[84] did it with four or five stabs behind until he killed him; and to Titu Cusi, the Inca who is now, they would have done the same, but he escaped down some rocks, which they showed me. They, however, succeeded in giving him a stab in the leg, the mark of which he afterwards showed me. If they had wanted to kill some Indians they could have done so, but their object was to kill the Inca. Then many Indians and captains assembled, who seized the Spaniards and killed them.\n \n On the 13th of May I sent two of my Indians to the Inca with some refreshments of raisins, figs, and other things. The Inca received them well, and gave them two baskets of earth nuts which they were to take to me, with a message that next day he would arrive, so that we should see each other soon, and that I need not travel further.\n \n On the 14th of May the Indians of Bambacona had made a large house on a strong height surrounded by entrenchments.

We arrived on Saturday, the eve of the Trinity, at the bridge of Chuquichaca, where we received the news that the Judge Matienzo was at the bridge of Amaibamba with 30 Spaniards, 10 negroes, 20 arquebusiers and 150 Cañari Indians with their lances. Presently we received a letter from the Judge Matienzo in which he said that he had come with this escort, that the Inca should cross the river to see him, and that the Treasurer Merlo, a clergyman, two other Spaniards and I would be hostages for his safety. The Inca wished to comply, but the captains would not consent. The Inca then wrote to the Judge Matienzo proposing that he should come with all his company to the passage of the bridge, that his honour should pass over, and that he, the Inca, would send as hostages his governor and camp master, who would go to the other side. The Inca then detached 300 Indians to keep watch and ward. I said that the Judge Matienzo would not consent to this, not having a royal commission, but that he would cross with all his escort and that, in that open space which was large, the Inca and Judge could see each other and discuss what they desired. The Inca wrote a letter to that effect. Then there were prepared litters of silver and gold and much carving, and he had 25 alcabuçes brought out, which he distributed among those who knew. He said to me that, as I was his friend, he wanted to tell me a secret. He had had 300 cloaks and also breeches of dead people brought. Then he called an assembly, saying that those who brought those clothes{197} had been killed, and if the Spaniards intended to attack, each one would become a good soldier in defence of his lord.",

Columbus, the capital of Ohio, is seated on the Scioto river, which is navigable for keel and flat boats, and small craft, almost to its source; and by means of a portage of about four miles, to Sandusky river, which flows into lake Erie, a convenient communication is established between the lakes, and the great western waters.

    "Description":"Cincinnati is built on a bend of the Ohio river, which takes here a semicircular form, and runs nearly west; it afterwards flows in a more southerly direction. A complete chain of hills, sweeping from one point of the bend round to the other, encloses the city in a sort of amphitheatre. The houses are mostly brick, and the streets all paved. There are several spacious and handsome market houses, which on market days are stocked with all kinds of provisions—indeed I think the market of Cincinnati is very nearly the best supplied in the United States. There are many respectable public buildings here, such as a courthouse, theatre, bazaar, (built by Mrs. Trollope, but the speculation failed), and divers churches, in which you may see well-dressed women, and hear orthodox, heterodox, and every other species of doctrine, promulgated and enforced by strength of lungs, and length of argument, with pulpit-drum accompaniment, and all other requisites ad captandum vulgus. The city stands on two plains: one called the bottom, extends about 260 yards back from the river, and is three miles in length, from Deer Creek to Mill Creek; the other is fifty feet higher than the first, and is called the Hill; this extends back about a mile. The bottom is sixty-five feet above low water mark. In 1815 the population was estimated at 6000, and at present it is supposed to be upwards of 25,000 souls. By means of the Dayton canal, which runs from that town nearly parallel with the “Big Miami” river, a very extensive trade, for all kinds of produce, is established with the back country. Steamers are constantly arriving at, and departing from the wharf, on their passage up and down the river. This is one of the many examples to be met with in the western country, of towns springing into importance within the memory of comparatively young men—a log-house is still standing, which is shewn as the first habitation built by the backwoodsman, who squatted in the forest where now stands a handsome and flourishing city.",

The principal streets rise one above the other, running parallel with the river; the houses are mostly built of stone, the bank being entirely composed of that material, the walls whitewashed, and the roofs covered with tin: from the opposite side it presents a very gay appearance. The ascent from the water's edge to the back of the town is considerable, but regular. The streets intersect each other at right angles, as do those of most American towns. They are much too narrow, having been laid down and built on from a plan designed by the Spanish commandant, previous to the Missouri territory becoming part of the United States. The population is estimated at six thousand, composed of Creole-French, Irish, and Americans. St. Louis must, at some future period, become decidedly the most important town in the western country, from its local and relative situation. It is seated on the most favourable point below the mouths of two noble rivers, the Missouri and the Illinois, having at its back an immense tract of fertile country, and open and easy communication Eighteen miles below the mouth of the Missouri, and thirty-six below that of the Illinois. with the finest parts of the western and north-western territories. These advantages, added to the constant and uninterrupted intercourse which it enjoys with the southern ports, must ultimately make St. Louis a town of wealth and magnitude.",

The public buildings of Louisville are few, and the streets are laid out in the usual style, crossing each other at right angles. It contains a few good brick dwelling-houses, and a number of excellent hack-carriages are stationed near the steam-boat landing. A canal round the Falls, from Beargrass-creek to Shippingsport, is being constructed, which will enable steam-boats of the largest tonnage to pass through; and thus it will open an uninterrupted intercourse between the Upper and Lower Ohio, and the Mississippi.

    "Description":"New Orleans is seated on the south-east bank of the Mississippi; and, following the sinuosities of the current, about 109 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. The river takes here a right-angular sweep, and the city proper is built on the exterior point of the bend, the fauxbourgs extending at each side along the banks. At high water the river rises three feet above any part of the city; consequently, were it not for leveés that have been constructed here, and also along the banks of the river for more than a hundred miles, at both sides, above and below, the whole country would be periodically inundated. The fall from the levée to Bayou St. John, which communicates with Lac Pontchartrain , is about thirty feet, and the distance one mile. This fall is certainly inconsiderable; but I apprehend that it would be sufficient to drain the streets effectually, if proper attention were directed to that object. The city extends only half-a-mile back, and, including the fauxbourgs , about two miles along the river. The streets, being only partially paved, can never be perfectly cleaned, and stagnant water remains in the kennels at all seasons; this and the exhalations from the swamps in warm weather, produce that pestilential scourge with which the place is annually afflicted. The mortality here last season (the autumn of 1829) has been variously stated in the public prints at from five to seven thousand, who died of the yellow fever in the space of about ten weeks. This statement, however, is erroneous; as, from information which I received from the sexton of the American grave-yard, and from the number of fresh graves which I saw there, I am inclined to think that the total amount falls short of 2500, out of a resident population of less than 40,000 souls. About 700 were buried in the American grave-yard, and perhaps double that number in that of the French. The port of New Orleans presents the most extraordinary medley of any port in the world. Craft of every possible variety may be seen moored along the leveés, and the markets and adjacent streets crowded with people of almost every nation in Europe, Africa, and America, who create a frightful confusion of tongues. A particular part of the quay is appropriated to each description of craft, and a penalty is enforced for any deviation from port regulations. The upper part is occupied with flat-boats, arks, peeroges, rafts, keelboats, canoes, and steam-boats; and below these are stationed schooners, cutters, brigs, ships, &c., in regular succession. The levée is almost constantly filled with merchandize; and the scene of bustle and confusion which is exhibited here during the early part of the day, fully proves the large amount of commercial intercourse which this city enjoys.",

    "Description":"Baltimore is seated on the north side of the Patapsco river, within a few miles of the Chesapeak bay. It received its name in compliment to the Irish family of the Calverts. The harbour, at Fell Point, has about eighteen feet water, and is defended by a strong fort, called Mc Henry's fort, on Observation Hill. Vessels of large tonnage cannot enter the basin. In 1791 it contained 13,503 inhabitants; in 1810, 46,487; and at present it contains 80,519. There are many fine buildings and monuments in this city; and the streets in which business is not extensively transacted, are planted with Lombardy poplar, locust, and pride-of-china trees,—the last mentioned especially afford a fine shade. A considerable schooner trade is carried on by the merchants of Baltimore with South America. The schooners of this port are celebrated for their beauty, and are much superior to those of any other port on the Continent. They are sharp built, somewhat resembling the small Greek craft one sees in the Mediterranean. A rail-road is being constructed from this place to the Ohio river, a distance of upwards of three hundred miles, and about fourteen miles of the road is already completed, as is also a viaduct. If the enterprising inhabitants of Baltimore be able to finish this undertaking, it must necessarily throw a very large amount of wealth into their hands, to the prejudice of Philadelphia and New York. But the expense will be enormous.",

    "Description":"Philadelphia is a regular well-built city, and one of the handsomest in the states. It lies in latitude 39°56 north, and longitude, west of London, 75°8; distant from the sea, 120 miles. The city stands on an elevated piece of ground between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers, about a mile broad from bank to bank, and six miles from their junction. The Delaware is about a mile wide at Philadelphia, and ships of the largest tonnage can approach the wharf. The city contains many fine buildings of Schuylkill marble. The streets are well paved, and have broad trottoirs of hard red brick. The police regulations are excellent, and cleanliness is much attended to, the kennels being washed daily during the summer months, with water from the reservoirs. The markets, or shambles, extend half-amile in length, from the wharf up Market-street, in six divisions. In addition to the shambles, farmers' waggons, loaded 311 with every kind of country produce for sale, line the street. There are five banking establishments in the city: the Bank of North America, the United States Bank, the Bank of Pennsylvania, the Bank of Philadelphia, and the Farmers' Bank. The principal institutions are, the Franklin library, which contains upwards of 20,000 volumes. Strangers are admitted gratis, and are permitted to peruse any of the books. The Americans should adopt this practice in all their national exhibitions, and rather copy the liberality of the French than the sordid churlishness of the English, who compel foreigners to pay even for seeing the property of the nation. The other institutions are, the University of Pennsylvania, a College, Medical Theatre, College of Physicians, Philosophical Hall, Agricultural and Linnean Societies, Academy of Fine Arts, and the Cincinnati Society, which originated in an attempt to establish a sort of aristocracy. The members were at its formation the surviving officers of the revolution; they wear an eagle, suspended by a ribbon, which, at their death, they have appointed to be taken by their eldest sons. There are besides, the Academies of the Philadelphian Friends, and the German Lutherans; Sunday and Lancasterian schools; and, of course, divers Bible and Tract Societies, which are patronized by all the antiquated dames in the city, and superintended by the Methodist and Presbyterian parsons. The Methodist parsons of this country have the character of being men of gallantry; and indeed, from the many instances I have heard of their propensity in this way, from young Americans, I should be a very sceptic to doubt the fact.",

    "Description":"Marseilles is seated in the midst of a semicircle of mountains of whitish rock, the steep and naked sides of which scarce afford “a footing for the goat.” Stretching into the Mediterranean they inclose a commodious harbor, in front of which are two or three rocky islands anchored in a sea of more vivid blue than any water I had ever before seen. The country immediately surrounding the city is an and and dusty valley, intersected here and there with the bed of a brook or torrent, dry during the summer. It is carefully cultivated, however, and planted with vineyards, and orchards of olive, fig, and pomegranate trees. The trees being small and low, the foliage of the olive thin and pale, the leaves of the fig broad and few, and the soil appearing everywhere at their roots, as well as between the rows of vines, the vegetation, when viewed from a little distance, has a meagre and ragged appearance. The whiteness of the hills, which the eye can hardly bear to rest upon at noon, the intense blue of the sea, the peculiar forms of the foliage, and the deficiency of shade and verdure, made me almost fancy myself in a tropical region. The Greeks judged well of the commercial advantages of Marseilles when they made it the seat of one of their early colonies. I found its streets animated with a bustle which I had not seen since I left New York, and its port thronged with vessels from all the nations whose coasts border upon the great midland sea of Europe. Marseilles is the most flourishing seaport in France; it has already become to the Mediterranean what New York is to the United States, and its trade is regularly increasing. The old town is ugly, but the lower or new part is nobly built of the light-colored stone so commonly used in France, and so easily wrought—with broad streets and, what is rare in French towns, convenient sidewalks. New streets are laid out, gardens are converted into building-lots, the process of levelling hills and filling up hollows is going on as in New York, the city is extending itself on every side, and large fortunes have been made by the rise in the value of landed property.",

    "Description":"Since my last letter I have visited Venice, a city which realizes the old mythological fable of beauty born of the sea. I must confess, however, that my first feeling on entering it was that of disappointment. As we passed in our gondola out of the lagoons, up one of the numerous canals, which permeate the city in every direction in such a manner that t seems as if you could only pass your time either within doors or in a boat, the place appeared to me a vast assemblage of prisons surrounded with their moats, and I thought how weary I should soon grow of my island prison, and how glad to escape again to the main-land. But this feeling quickly gave way to delight and admiration, when I landed and surveyed the clean though narrow streets, never incommoded by dust nor disturbed by the noise and jostling of carriages and horses, by which you may pass to every part of the city—when I looked again at the rows of superb buildings, with their marble steps ascending out of the water of the canals, in which the gondolas were shooting by each other—when I stood in the immense square of St. Mark, surrounded by palaces resting on arcades, under which the shops rival in splendor those of Paris, and crowds of the gay inhabitants of both sexes assemble towards evening and sit in groups before the doors of the coffee-houses—and when I gazed on the barbaric magnificence of the church of St. Mark and the Doge's palace, surrounded by the old emblems of the power of Venice, and overlooking the Adriatic, once the empire of the republic. The architecture of Venice has, to my eyes, something watery and oceanic in its aspect. Under the hands of Palladio, the Grecian orders seemed to borrow the lightness and airiness of the Gothic. As you look at the numerous windows and the multitude of columns which give a striated appearance to the fronts of the palaces, you think of stalactites and icicles, such as you might imagine to ornament the abodes of the water-gods and sea-nymphs. The only thing needed to complete the poetic illusion is transparency or brilliancy of color, and this is wholly wanting; for at Venice the whitest marble is soon clouded and blackened by the corrosion of the sea-air.",

The dwellings have a pleasant appearance, often standing by themselves in the midst of gardens, In front of several, I saw large magnolias, their dark, glazed leaves glittering in. the March sunshine. The river, as yellow as the Tiber, its waters now stained with the earth of the upper country, runs by the upper part of the town in noisy rapids, embracing several islands, shaded with the plane-tree, the hackberry, and the elm, and prolific, in spring and summer, of wild-flowers. I went upon one of these islands, by means of a footbridge, and was pointed to another, the resort of a quoit-club comprising some of the most distinguished men of Richmond, among whom in his lifetime was Judge Marshall, who sometimes joined in this athletic sport. We descended one of the hills on which the town is built, and went up another to the east, where stands an ancient house of religious worship, the oldest Episcopal church in the state. It is in the midst of a burying-ground, where sleep some of the founders of the colony, whose old graves are greenly overgrown with the trailing and matted periwinkle. In this church, Patrick Henry, at the commencement of the American Revolution, made that celebrated speech, which so vehemently moved all who heard him, ending with the sentence: “Give me liberty or give me death.” We looked in at one of the windows; it is a low, plain room, with small, square pews, and a sound ing board over the little pulpit. From the hill on which this church stands, you have a beautiful view of the surrounding country, a gently undulating surface, closed in by hills on the west; and the James River is seen wandering through it, by distant plantations, and between borders of trees. A place was pointed out to us, a little way down the river, which bears the name of Powhatan; and here, I was told, a flat rock is still shown as the one on which Captain Smith was placed by his captors, in order to be put to death, when the intercession of Pocahontas saved his life.",

    "Description":"The next morning, at eight o'clock, we found ourselves entering Charleston harbor; Sullivan's Island, with Fort Moultrie, breathing recollections of the revolution, on our right; James Island on our left; in front, the stately dwellings of the town, and all around, on the land side, the horizon bounded by an apparent belt of evergreens—the live-oak, the wateroak, the palmetto, the pine, and, planted about the dwellings, the magnolia and the wild orange—giving to the scene a summer aspect. The city of Charleston strikes the visitor from the north most agreeably. He perceives at once that he is in a different climate. The spacious houses are surrounded with broad piazzas, often a piazza to each story, for the sake of shade and coolness, and each house generally stands by itself in a garden planted with trees and shrubs, many of which preserve their verdure through the winter. We saw early flowers already opening; the peach and plum-tree were in full bloom; and the wild orange, as they call the cherry-laurel, was just putting forth its blossoms. The buildings— some with stuccoed walls, some built of large dark-red bricks, and some of wood—are not kept fresh with paint like ours, but are allowed to become weather-stained by the humid climate, like those of the European towns. The streets are broad and quiet, unpaved in some parts, but in none, as with us, offensive both to sight and smell. The public buildings are numerous for the size of the city, and well-built in general, with sufficient space about them to give them a noble aspect, and all the advantage which they could derive from their architecture. The inhabitants, judging from what I have seen of them, which is not much, I confess, do not appear undeserving of the character which has been given them, of possessing the most polished and agreeable manners of all the American cities.",

Oglethorpe seems to have understood how a city should be built in a warm climate, and the people of the place are fond of reminding the stranger that the original plan of the founder has never been departed from. The town, so charmingly embowered, reminded me of New Haven, though the variety of trees is greater. In my walks about the place I passed a large stuccoed building of a dull-yellow color, with broad arched windows, and a stately portico, on each side of which stood a stiff-looking palmetto, as if keeping guard. The grim aspect of the building led me to ask what it was, and I was answered that it was “the old United States Bank.” It was the building in which the Savannah branch of that bank transacted business, and is now shut up until the time shall come when that great institution shall be revived. Meantime I was pained to see that there exists so little reverence for its memory, and so little gratitude for its benefits, that the boys have taken to smashing the windows, so that those who have the care of the building have been obliged to cover them with plank. In another part of the city I was shown an African church, a neat, spacious wooden building, railed in, and kept in excellent order, with a piazza extending along its entire front. It is one of the four places of worship for the blacks of the town, and was built by negro workmen with materials purchased by the contributions of the whites. South of the town extends an uninclosed space, on one side of which is a pleasant grove of pines, in the shade of which the members of a quoit-club practice their athletic sport. Here on a Saturday afternoon, for that is their stated time of assembling, I was introduced to some of the most distinguished citizens of Savannah, and witnessed the skill with which they threw the discus. No apprentices were they in the art; there was no striking far from the stake, no sending the discus rolling over the green; they heaped the quoits as snugly around the stakes as if the amusement had been their profession. In the same neighborhood, just without the town, lies the public cemetery surrounded by an ancient wall, built before the revolution, which in some places shows the marks of shot fired against it in the skirmishes of that period. I entered it, hoping to find some monuments of those who founded the city a hundred and ten years ago, but the inscriptions are of comparatively recent date. Most of them commemorate the death of persons born in Europe, or the northern states. I was told that the remains of the early inhabitants lie in the brick tombs, of which there are many without any inscription whatever.",

The mornings are sometimes a little sultry, but after two or three hours, a fresh breeze comes in from the sea, sweeping through the broad piazzas and breathing in at the windows. At this season it comes laden with the fragrance of the flowers of the Pride of India, and sometimes of the orange-tree, and sometimes brings the scent of roses, now in full bloom.

    "Description":"“Liverpool,” said one of its inhabitants to me, “is more like an American than an English city; it is new, bustling, and prosperous.” I saw some evidences of this after I had got my baggage through the custom-house, which was attended with considerable delay, the officers prying very closely into the contents of certain packages which I was taking for friends of mine to their friends in England, cutting the packthread, breaking the seals, and tearing the wrappers without mercy. I saw the streets crowded with huge drays, carrying merchandise to and, fro, and admired the solid construction of the docks, in which lay thousands of vessels from all parts of the globe. The walls of these docks are built of large blocks of red sandstone, with broad gateways opening to the river Mersey, and when the tide is at its height, which I believe is about thirty feet from low water, the gates are open, and vessels allowed to enter and depart. When the tide begins to retire, the gates are closed, and the water and the vessels locked in together. Along the river for miles, the banks are flanked with this massive masonry, which in some places I should judge to be nearly forty feet in height. Meantime the town is spread ing into the interior; new streets are opened; in one field you may see the brickmakers occupied in their calling, and in the opposite one the bricklayers building rows of houses. New churches and new public buildings of various kinds are going up in these neighborhoods. The streets which contain the shops have for the most part a gay and showy appearance; the buildings are generally of stucco, and show more of architectural decoration than in our cities. The greater part of the houses, however, are built of brick which has a rough surface, and soon acquires in this climate a dark color, giving a gloomy aspect to the streets. The public buildings, which are rather numerous, are of a drab-colored freestone, and those which have been built for forty or fifty years, the Town Hall, for example, and some of the churches, appear almost of a sooty hue.",

The artizans were all out with their families, and great numbers of country people were sauntering about. This fair was once, what its name imports, an annual market for the sale of merchandise; but it is now a mere holiday in which the principal sales, as it appeared to me, were of gingerbread and whisky. I strolled the next morning to the Green, a spacious open ground that stretches along the Clyde. One part of it was occupied with the booths and temporary theatres and wagons of showmen, around and among which a vast throng was assembled, who seemed to delight in being deafened with the cries of the showmen and the music of their instruments. In one place a band was playing, in another a gong was thundering, and from one of the balconies a fellow in regal robes and a pasteboard crown, surrounded by several persons of both sexes in tawdry stage-dresses, who seemed to have just got out of bed and were yawning and rubbing their eyes, was vociferating to the crowd in praise of the entertainment which was shortly to be offered them, while not far off the stentor of a rival company, under a flag which announced a new pantomime for a penny, was declaiming with equal vehemence. I made my way with difficulty through the crowd to the ancient street called the Salt Market, in which Scott places the habitation of Baillie Jarvie. It was obstructed with little stalls, where toys and other inconsiderable articles were sold. Here at the corner of one of the streets stands the old tower of the Tolbooth where Rob Roy was confined, a solid piece of ancient architecture. The main building has been removed and a modern house supplies its place; the tower has been pierced below for a thoroughfare, and its clock still reports the time of day to the people of Glasgow. The crowd through which I passed had that squalid appearance which marks extreme poverty and uncertain means of subsistence, and I was able to form some idea of the prodigious number of this class in a populous city of Great Britain like Glasgow. For populous she is, and prosperous as a city, increasing with a rapidity almost equal to that of New York, and already she numbers, it is estimated, three hundred thousand inhabitants. Of these it is said that full one-third are Irish by birth or born of Irish parents. The next day, which was Sunday, before going to church, I walked towards the west part of the city; where the streets are broad and the houses extremely well-built, of the same noble material as the new town of Edinburgh; and many of the dwellings have fine gardens. Their sites in many places overlook the pleasant valley of the Clyde, and I could not help acknowledging that Glasgow was not without claim to the epithet of beautiful, which I should have denied her if I had formed my judgment from the commercial streets only. The people of Glasgow also have shown their good sense in erecting the statues which adorn their public squares, only to men who have some just claim to distinction.",

    "Description":"We passed two nights in Antwerp, and then went down the Scheldt in a steamer, which, in ten hours, brought us to Rotterdam, sometimes crossing an arm of the sea, and sometimes threading a broad canal. The houses on each side of these channels, after we entered Holland, were for the most part freshly painted; the flat plains on each side protected by embankments, and streaked by long wide ditches full of water, and rows of pollard willows. Windmills by scores, some grinding corn, but most of them pumping water out of the meadows and pouring it into the channel, stood on the bank and were swinging their long arms madly in a high wind. On arriving at Rotterdam, you perceive at once that you are in Holland. The city has as many canals as streets, the canals are generally overhung with rows of elms, and the streets kept scrupulously clean with the water of the canals, which is salt. Every morning there is a vigorous splashing and mopping performed before every door by plump servant girls, in white caps and thick wooden shoes. Our hotel stood fronting a broad sheet of water like the lagoons at Venice, where a solid and straight stone wharf was shaded with a row of elms, and before our door lay several huge vessels fastened to the wharf, which looked as if they were sent thither to enjoy a vacation, for they were neither loading nor unloading, nor did any person appear to be busy about them. Rotterdam was at that time in the midst of a fair which filled the open squares and the wider streets of the city with booths, and attracted crowds of people from the country. There were damsels from North Holland, fair as snow, and some of them pretty, in long-eared lace caps, with their plump arms bare; and there were maidens from another province, the name of which I did not learn, equally good-looking, with arms as bare, and faces in white muslin caps drawn to a point on each cheek. Olycoeks were frying, and waffles baking in temporary kitchens on each side of the streets.",

    "Description":"It is situated beyond a steep bank of the lake, nearly as elevated as the shore at Brooklyn, which we call Brooklyn Heights. As I stood on the edge of this bank and looked over the broad lake below me, stretching beyond the sight and quivering in the summer wind, I was reminded of the lines of Southey: —\"Along the bending line of shore Such hue is thrown as when the peacock's neck Assumes its proudest tint of amethyst, Embathed in emerald glory.\" But it was not only along the line of the shore that these hues prevailed; the whole lake glowed with soft amethystine and emerald tinges, in irregular masses, like the shades of watered silk. Cleveland stands in that beautiful country without a hill, of which my fellowpassenger spoke—a thriving village yet to grow into a proud city of the lake country. It is built upon broad dusty ways, in which not a pebble is seen in the fat dark earth of the lake shore, and which are shaded with locust-trees, the variety called seed-locust, with crowded twigs and clustered foliage—a tree chosen, doubtless, for its rapid growth, as the best means of getting up a shade at the shortest notice. Here and there were gardens filled with young fruit-trees; among the largest and hardiest in appearance was the peachtree, which here spreads broad and sturdy branches, escapes the diseases that make it a short-lived tree in the Atlantic states, and produces fruit of great size and richness. One of my fellow-passengers could hardly find adequate expressions to signify his high sense of the deliciousness of the Cleveland Peaches.",

Rome is the head of the kingdoms of Christendom, and contains about 200 Jews, who occupy an honourable position and pay no tribute, and amongst them are officials of the Pope Alexander, the spiritual head of all Christendom. Great scholars reside here, at the head of them being R. Daniel, the chief rabbi, and R. Jechiel, an official of the Pope. He is a handsome young man of intelligence and wisdom, and he has the entry of the Pope's palace; for he is the steward of his house and of all that he has. He is a grandson of R. Nathan, who composed the Aruch and its commentaries. Other scholars are R. Joab, son of the chief rabbi R. Solomon, R. Menachem, head of the academy, R. Jechiel, who lives in Trastevere, and R. Benjamin, son of R. Shabbethai of blessed memory. Rome is divided into two parts by the River Tiber. In the one part is the great church which they call St. Peter's of Rome. The great Palace of Julius Caesar was also in Rome.\n There are many wonderful structures in the city, different from any others in the world. Including both its inhabited and ruined parts, Rome is about twenty-four miles in circumference. In the midst thereof there are eighty palaces belonging to eighty kings who lived there, each called Imperator, commencing from King Tarquinius down to Nero and Tiberius, who lived at the time of Jesus the Nazarene, ending with Pepin, who freed the land of Sepharad from Islam, and was father of Charlemagne.\n ...\n There is also a cave in a hill on one bank of the River Tiber where are the graves of the ten martyrs. In front of St. John in the Lateran there are statues of Samson in marble, with a spear in his hand, and of Absalom the son of King David, and another of Constantinus the Great, who built Constantinople and after whom it was called. The last-named statue is of bronze, the horse being overlaid with gold. Many other edifices are there, and remarkable sights beyond enumeration.",

There were battles fought here in olden times, and in the palace more than 100,000 men were slain, and there their bones remain piled up to the present day.

The chief of all is the Emperor. The first (of the twelve) is called the great Overseer, the second the great Housholder, the third Lord; the fourth Great General ; the fifth the Financier or (Economist, and the Names of the Rest are similar. Constantinople is eighteen Miles in Circumference and situated in such a manner, that the one half is washed by the Sea ; and the other bounded by the Continent. It hangs over two Arms of the Sea, or is situated on two Straits, one of which arises from the Ruffian Sea, and the other from the Sea of Sepharad, which is Spain . Here Merchants of every Sort assemble together, from Babylon, from all Mesopotamia, Media, Persia, from all the Kingdom of Egypt, Canaan, Russia, Hungary, Pesiinki, Buria, Lombardy, and finally from the Land of the Sephardim. This causes a perpetual Hurry of People, who traffick in this Place from all Parts of the World by Land and Sea, insomuch that in this Respect it exceeds all other Cities, except the great City of Bagdad, the Metropolis of the Ishmaelites; [Description of Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, and Palace.]\n \n The daily Tribute of this City, is said to amount to twenty thousand Pieces of Gold, which arises from Imports, hire of Shops, Markets, and Tribute of the Merchants, who flock together here from Sea and Land. The Jivanitilh Inhabitants of this Country are very rich in Gold and Jewels, and wear Silk Veils, over which they throw other spotted Garments, interwoven and embroidered with Gold, and thus apparelled , they ride on Horse back, and appear like Sons of Kings.",

They have priests of the seed (of Aaron), and they call them Aaronim, who do not intermarry with Cuthim, but wed only amongst themselves. These priests offer sacrifices, and bring burnt-offerings in their place of assembly on Mount Gerizim, as it is written in their law—\"And thou shalt set the blessing on Mount Gerizim.\" They say that this is the proper site of the Temple. On Passover and the other festivals they offer up burnt-offerings on the altar which they have built on Mount Gerizim, as it is written in their law—\"Ye shall set up the stones upon Mount Gerizim, of the stones which Joshua and the children of Israel set up at the Jordan.\" They say that they are descended from the tribe of Ephraim. And in the midst of them is the grave of Joseph, the son of Jacob our father, as it is written—\"and the bones of Joseph buried they in Shechem.\" Their alphabet lacks three letters, namely . The letter He is taken from Abraham our father, because they have no dignity, the letter Heth from Isaac, because they have no kindliness, and the letter Ain from Jacob, because they have no humility. In place of these letters they make use of the Aleph, by which we can tell that they are not of the seed of Israel, although they know the law of Moses with the exception of these three letters. They guard themselves from the defilement of the dead, of the bones of the slain, and of graves; and they remove the garments which they have worn before they go to the place of worship, and they bathe and put on fresh clothes. This is their constant practice. On Mount Gerizim are fountains and gardens and plantations, but Mount Ebal is rocky and barren; and between them in the valley lies the city of Shechem.",

It is a fair city of large extent, surrounded by walls, with many gardens and plantations, extending over fifteen miles on each side, and no district richer in fruit can be seen in all the world. From Mount Hermon descend the rivers Amana and Pharpar; for the city is situated at the foot of Mount Hermon. The Amana flows through the city, and by means of aqueducts the water is conveyed to the houses of the great people, and into the streets and market-places. The Pharpar flows through their gardens and plantations. It is a place carrying on trade with all countries. Here is a mosque of the Arabs called the Gami of Damascus; there is no building like it in the whole world, and they say that it was a palace of Ben Hadad. Here is a wall of crystal glass of magic workmanship, with apertures according to the days of the year, and as the sun's rays enter each of them in daily succession the hours of the day can be told by a graduated dial. In the palace are chambers built of gold and glass, and if people walk round the wall they are able to see one another, although the wall is between them. And there are columns overlaid with gold and silver, and columns of marble of all colours. And in the court there is a gigantic head overlaid with gold and silver, and fashioned like a bowl with rims of gold and silver. It is as big as a cask, and three men can enter therein at the same time to bathe. In the palace is suspended the rib of one of the giants, the length being nine cubits, and the width two cubits; and they say it belonged to the King Anak of the giants of old, whose name was Abramaz. For so it was found inscribed on his grave, where it was also written that he ruled over the whole world. Three thousand Jews abide in this city, and amongst them are learned and rich men. The head of the Academy of the land of Israel resides here. His name is R. Azariah, and with him are his brother, Sar Shalom, the head of the Beth Din: R. Joseph, the fifth of the Academy: R. Mazliach, the lecturer, the head of the order: R. Meir, the crown of the scholars: R. Joseph ben Al Pilath, the pillar of the Academy: R. Heman, the warden: and R. Zedekiah, the physician. One hundred Karaïtes dwell here, also 400 Cuthim, and there is peace between them, but they do not intermarry.",

    "Description":"Thence it is two days to Bagdad, the great city and the royal residence of the Caliph Emir al Muminin al Abbasi of the family of Mohammed. He is at the head of the Mohammedan religion, and all the kings of Islam obey him; he occupies a similar position to that held by the Pope over the Christians. He has a palace in Bagdad three miles in extent, wherein is a great park with all varieties of trees, fruit-bearing and otherwise, and all manner of animals. The whole is surrounded by a wall, and in the park there is a lake whose waters are fed by the river Hiddekel. Whenever the king desires to indulge in recreation and to rejoice and feast, his servants catch all manner of' birds, game and fish, and he goes to his palace with his counsellors and princes. There the great king, Al Abbasi the Caliph (Hafiz) holds his court, and he is kind unto Israel, and many belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants; he knows all languages, and is well versed in the law of Israel. He reads and writes the holy language (Hebrew). He will not partake of anything unless he has earned it by the work of his own hands. He makes coverlets to which he attaches his seal; his courtiers sell them in the market, and the great ones of the land purchase them, and the proceeds thereof provide his sustenance. He is truthful and trusty, speaking peace to all men. The men of Islam see him but once in the year. The pilgrims that come from distant lands to go unto Mecca which is in the land El-Yemen, are anxious to see his face, and they assemble before the palace exclaiming \"Our Lord, light of Islam and glory of our Law, show us the effulgence of thy countenance,\" but he pays no regard to their words. Then the princes who minister unto him say to him, \"Our Lord, spread forth thy peace unto the men that have come from distant lands, who crave to abide under the shadow of thy graciousness,\" and thereupon he arises and lets down the hem of his robe from the window, and the pilgrims come and kiss it, and a prince says unto them \"Go forth in peace, for our Master the Lord of Islam granteth peace to you.\" He is regarded by them as Mohammed and they go to their houses rejoicing at the salutation which the prince has vouchsafed unto them, and glad at heart that they have kissed his robe.\n Each of his brothers and the members of his family has an abode in his palace, but they are all fettered in chains of iron, and guards are placed over each of their houses so that they may not rise against the great Caliph. For once it happened to a predecessor that his brothers rose up against him and proclaimed one of themselves as Caliph; then it was decreed that all the members of his family should be bound, that they might not rise up against the ruling Caliph. Each one of them resides in his palace in great splendour, and they own villages and towns, and their stewards bring them the tribute thereof, and they eat and drink and rejoice all the days of their life. Within the domains of the palace of the Caliph there are great buildings of marble and columns of silver and gold, and7 carvings upon rare stones are fixed in the walls. In the Caliph's palace are great riches and towers filled with gold, silken garments and all precious stones. He does not issue forth from his palace save once in the year, at the feast which the Mohammedans call El-id-bed Ramazan, and they come from distant lands that day to see him. He rides on a mule and is attired in the royal robes of gold and silver and fine linen; on his head is a turban adorned with precious stones of priceless value, and over the turban is a black shawl as a sign of his modesty, implying that all this glory will be covered by darkness on the day of death. He is accompanied by all the nobles of Islam dressed in fine garments and riding on horses, the princes of Arabia, the princes of Togarma and Daylam (Gilān) and the princes of Persia, Media and Ghuzz, and the princes of the land of Tibet, which is three months' journey distant, and westward of which lies the land of Samarkand. He proceeds from his palace to the great mosque of Islam which is by the Basrah Gate. Along the road the walls are adorned with silk and purple, and the inhabitants receive him with all kinds of song and exultation, and they dance before the great king who is styled the Caliph. They salute him with a loud voice and say, \"Peace unto thee, our Lord the King and Light of Islam!\" He kisses his robe, and stretching forth the hem thereof he salutes them. Then he proceeds to the court of the mosque, mounts a wooden pulpit and expounds to them their Law. Then the learned ones of Islam arise and pray for him and extol his greatness and his graciousness, to which they all respond. Afterwards he gives them his blessing, and they bring before him a camel which he slays, and this is their passover-sacrifice. He gives thereof unto the princes and they distribute it to all, so that they may taste of the sacrifice brought by their sacred king; and they all rejoice. Afterwards he leaves the mosque and returns alone to his palace by way of the river Hiddekel, and the grandees of Islam accompany him in ships on the river until he enters his palace. He does not return the way he came; and the road which he takes along the river-side is watched all the year through, so that no man shall tread in his footsteps. He does not leave the palace again for a whole year. He is a benevolent man.\n \n He built, on the other side of the river, on the banks of an arm of the Euphrates which there borders the city, a hospital consisting of blocks of houses and hospices for the sick poor who come to be healed. Here there are about sixty physicians' stores which are provided from the Caliph's house with drugs and whatever else may be required. Every sick man who comes is maintained at the Caliph's expense and is medically treated. Here is a building which is called Dar-al-Maristan, where they keep charge of the demented people who have become insane in the towns through the great heat in the summer, and they chain each of them in iron chains until their reason becomes restored to them in the winter-time. Whilst they abide there, they are provided with food from the house of the Caliph, and when their reason is restored they are dismissed and each one of them goes to his house and his home. Money is given to those that have stayed in the hospices on their return to their homes. Every month the officers of the Caliph inquire and investigate whether they have regained their reason, in which case they are discharged. All this the Caliph does out of charity to those that come to the city of Bagdad, whether they be sick or insane. The Caliph is a righteous man, and all his actions are for good.\n In Bagdad there are about 40,000 Jews, and they dwell in security, prosperity and honour under the great Caliph, and amongst them are great sages, the heads of Academies engaged in the study of the law. In this city there are ten Academies. At the head of the great Academy is the chief rabbi R. Samuel, the son of Eli. He is the head of the Academy Gaon Jacob. He is a Levite, and traces his pedigree back to Moses our teacher. The head of the second Academy is R. Hanania his brother, warden of the Levites; R. Daniel is the head of the third Academy; R. Elazar the scholar is the head of the fourth Academy; and R. Elazar, the son of Zemach, is the head of the order, and his pedigree reaches to Samuel the prophet, the Korahite. He and his brethren know how to chant the melodies as did the singers at the time when the Temple was standing. He is head of the fifth Academy. R. Hisdai, the glory of the scholars, is head of the sixth Academy. R. Haggai is head of the seventh Academy. R. Ezra is the head of the eighth Academy. R. Abraham, who is called Abu Tahir, is the head of the ninth Academy. R. Zakkai, the son of Bostanai the Nasi, is the head of the Sium. These are the ten Batlanim, and they do not engage in any other work than communal administration; and all the days of the week they judge the Jews their countrymen, except on the second day of the week, when they all appear before the chief rabbi Samuel, the head of the Yeshiba Gaon (Jacob), who in conjunction with the other Batlanim judges all those that appear before him. And at the head of them all is Daniel the son of Hisdai, who is styled \"Our Lord the Head of the Captivity of all Israel.\" He possesses a book of pedigrees going back as far as David, King of Israel. The Jews call him \"Our Lord, Head of the Captivity,\" and the Mohammedans call him \"Saidna ben Daoud,\" and he has been invested with authority over all the congregations of Israel at the hands of the Emir al Muminin, the Lord of Islam.\n For thus Mohammed commanded concerning him and his descendants; and he granted him a seal of office over all the congregations that dwell under his rule, and ordered that every one, whether Mohammedan or Jew, or belonging to any other nation in his dominion, should rise up before him (the Exilarch) and salute him, and that any one who should refuse to rise up should receive one hundred stripes.\n \n And every fifth day when he goes to pay a visit to the great Caliph, horsemen, Gentiles as well as Jews, escort him, and heralds proclaim in advance, \"Make way before our Lord, the son of David, as is due unto him,\" the Arabic words being \"Amilu tarik la Saidna ben Daud.\" He is mounted on a horse, and is attired in robes of silk and embroidery with a large turban on his head, and from the turban is suspended a long white cloth adorned with a chain upon which the cipher of Mohammed is engraved. Then he appears before the Caliph and kisses his hand, and the Caliph rises and places him on a throne which Mohammed had ordered to be made for him, and all the Mohammedan princes who attend the court of the Caliph rise up before him. And the Head of the Captivity is seated on his throne opposite to the Caliph, in compliance with the command of Mohammed to give effect to what is written in the law—\"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a law-giver from between his feet, until he come to Shiloh: and to him shall the gathering of the people be.\" The authority of the Head of the Captivity extends over all the communities of Shinar, Persia, Khurasan and Sheba which is El-Yemen, and Diyar Kalach (Bekr) and the land of Aram Naharaim (Mesopotamia), and over the dwellers in the mountains of Ararat and the land of the Alans, which is a land surrounded by mountains and has no outlet except by the iron gates which Alexander made, but which were afterwards broken. Here are the people called Alani. His authority extends also over the land of Siberia, and the communities in the land of the Togarmim unto the mountains of Asveh and the land of Gurgan, the inhabitants of which are called Gurganim who dwell by the river Gihon, and these are the Girgashites who follow the Christian religion. Further it extends to the gates of Samarkand, the land of Tibet, and the land of India. In respect of all these countries the Head of the Captivity gives the communities power to appoint Rabbis and Ministers who come unto him to be consecrated and to receive his authority. They bring him offerings and gifts from the ends of the earth. He owns hospices, gardens and plantations in Babylon, and much land inherited from his fathers, and no one can take his possessions from him by force. He has a fixed weekly revenue arising from the hospices of the Jews, the markets and the merchants, apart from that which is brought to him from far-off lands. The man is very rich, and wise in the Scriptures as well as in the Talmud, and many Israelites dine at his table every day.\n At his installation, the Head of the Captivity gives much money to the Caliph, to the Princes and the Ministers. On the day that the Caliph performs the ceremony of investing him with authority, he rides in the second of the royal equipages, and is escorted from the palace of the Caliph to his own house with timbrels and fifes. The Exilarch appoints the Chiefs of the Academies by placing his hand upon their heads, thus installing them in their office. The Jews of the city are learned men and very rich.\n \n In Bagdad there are twenty-eight Jewish Synagogues, situated either in the city itself or in Al-Karkh on the other side of the Tigris; for the river divides the metropolis into two parts. The great synagogue of the Head of the Captivity has columns of marble of various colours overlaid with silver and gold, and on these columns are sentences of the Psalms in golden letters. And in front of the ark are about ten steps of marble; on the topmost step are the seats of the Head of the Captivity and of the Princes of the House of David. The city of Bagdad is twenty miles in circumference, situated in a land of palms, gardens and plantations, the like of which is not to be found in the whole land of Shinar. People come thither with merchandise from all lands. Wise men live there, philosophers who know all manner of wisdom, and magicians expert in all manner of witchcraft.",

    "Description":"Thence it is three parasangs to the Synagogue of Ezekiel, the prophet of blessed memory, which is by the river Euphrates. It is fronted by sixty turrets, and between each turret there is a minor Synagogue, and in the court of the Synagogue is the ark, and at the back of the Synagogue is the sepulchre of Ezekiel. It is surmounted by a large cupola, and it is a very handsome structure. It was built of old by King Jeconiah, king of Judah, and the 35,000 Jews who came with him, when Evil-merodach brought him forth out of prison. This place is by the river Chebar on the one side, and by the river Euphrates on the other, and the names of Jeconiah and those that accompanied him are engraved on the wall: Jeconiah at the top, and Ezekiel at the bottom. This place is held sacred by Israel as a lesser sanctuary unto this day, and people come from a distance to pray there from the time of the New Year until the Day of Atonement. The Israelites have great rejoicings on these occasions. Thither also come the Head of the Captivity, and the Heads of the Academies from Bagdad. Their camp occupies a space of about two miles, and Arab merchants come there as well. A great gathering like a fair takes place, which is called Fera, and they bring forth a scroll of the Law written on parchment by Ezekiel the Prophet, and read from it on the Day of Atonement. A lamp burns day and night over the sepulchre of Ezekiel; the light thereof has been kept burning from the day that he lighted it himself, and they continually renew the wick thereof, and replenish the oil unto the present day. A large house belonging to the sanctuary is filled with books, some of them from the time of the first temple, and some from the time of the second temple, and he who has no sons consecrates his books to its use. The Jews that come thither to pray from the land of Persia and Media bring the money which their countrymen have offered to the Synagogue of Ezekiel the Prophet. The Synagogue owns property, lands and villages, which belonged to King Jeconiah, and when Mohammed came he confirmed all these rights to the Synagogue of Ezekiel. Distinguished Mohammedans also come hither to pray, so great is their love for Ezekiel the Prophet; and they call it Bar (Dar) Melicha (the Dwelling of Beauty). All the Arabs come there to pray.\n At a distance of about half a mile from the Synagogue are the sepulchres of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and upon their sepulchres are large cupolas; and even at times of disturbance no man would dare touch the Mohammedan or Jewish servants who attend at the sepulchre of Ezekiel.",

    "Description":"In front of one of the synagogues is the sepulchre of Daniel of blessed memory. The river Tigris divides the city, and the bridge connects the two parts. On the one side where the Jews dwell is the sepulchre of Daniel. Here the market-places used to be, containing great stores of merchandise, by which the Jews became enriched. On the other side of the bridge they were poor, because they had no market-places nor merchants there, only gardens and plantations. And they became jealous, and said \"All this prosperity enjoyed by those on the other side is due to the merits of Daniel the prophet who lies buried there.\" Then the poor people asked those who dwelt on the other side to place the sepulchre of Daniel in their midst, but the others would not comply. So war prevailed between them for many days, and no one went forth or came in on account of the great strife between them. At length both parties growing tired of this state of things took a wise view of the matter, and made a compact, namely, that the coffin of Daniel should be taken for one year to the one side and for another year to the other side. This they did, and both sides became rich. In the course of time Sinjar Shah-ben-Shah, who ruled over the kingdom of Persia and had forty-five kings subject to his authority, came to this place. \n He is called Sultan-al-Fars-al-Khabir in Arabic (the mighty Sovereign of Persia), and it is he who ruled from the river Samara unto the city of Samarkand, and unto the river Gozan and the cities of Media and the mountains of Chafton. He ruled also over Tibet, in the forests whereof one finds the animals from which the musk is obtained. The extent of his Empire is a journey of four months. When this great Emperor Sinjar, king of Persia, saw that they took the coffin of Daniel from one side of the river to the other, and that a great multitude of Jews, Mohammedans and Gentiles, and many people from the country were crossing the bridge, he asked the meaning of this proceeding, and they told him these things. He said, \"It is not meet to do this ignominy unto Daniel the prophet, but I command you to measure the bridge from both sides, and to take the coffin of Daniel and place it inside another coffin of crystal, so that the wooden coffin be within that of crystal, and to suspend this from the middle of the bridge by a chain of iron; at this spot you must build a synagogue for all comers, so that whoever wishes to pray there, be he Jew or Gentile, may do so.\" And to this very day the coffin is suspended from the bridge. And the king commanded that out of respect for Daniel no fisherman should catch fish within a mile above or a mile below.",

    "Description":"[Location for the Castle that Hasan-i Sabbah (Old Man) lived in at his death.]\n Thence it is four days to the land of Mulahid. Here live a people who do not profess the Mohammedan religion, but live on high mountains, and worship the Old Man of the land of the Hashishim. And among them there are four communities of Israel who go forth with them in war-time. They are not under the rule of the king of Persia, but reside in the high mountains, and descend from these mountains to pillage and to capture booty, and then return to the mountains, and none can overcome them. There are learned men amongst the Jews of their land. These Jews are under the authority of the Head of the Captivity in Babylon. Thence it is five days to Amadia where there are about 25,000 Israelites. This is the first of those communities that dwell in the mountains of Chafton, where there are more than 100 Jewish communities. Here is the commencement of the land of Media. These Jews belong to the first captivity which King Shalmanezar led away; and they speak the language in which the Targum is written. Amongst them are learned men. The communities reach from the province of Amadia unto the province of Gilan, twenty-five days distant, on the border of the kingdom of Persia. They are under the authority of the king of Persia, and he raises a tribute from them through the hands of his officer, and the tribute which they pay every year by way of poll tax is one gold amir, which is equivalent to one and one-third maravedi. At this place (Amadia), there arose this day ten years ago, a man named David Alroy of the city of Amadia. He studied under Chisdai the Head of the Captivity, and under the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, in the city of Bagdad, and he was well versed in the Law of Israel, in the Halachah, as well as in the Talmud, and in all the wisdom of the Mohammedans, also in secular literature and in the writings of magicians and soothsayers. He conceived the idea of rebelling against the king of Persia, and of collecting the Jews who live in the mountains of Chafton to go forth and to fight against all the nations, and to march and capture Jerusalem. He showed signs by pretended miracles to the Jews, and said, \"The Holy One, blessed be He, sent me to capture Jerusalem and to free you from the yoke of the Gentiles.\" And the Jews believed in him and called him their Messiah. When the king of Persia heard of it he sent for him to come and speak with him. Alroy went to him without fear, and when he had audience of the king, the latter asked him, \"Art thou the king of the Jews?\" He answered, \"I am.\" Then the king was wrath, and commanded that he should be seized and placed in the prison of the king, the place where the king's prisoners were bound unto the day of their death, in the city of Tabaristan which is on the large river Gozan. At the end of three days, whilst the king was sitting deliberating with his princes concerning the Jews who had rebelled, David suddenly stood before them. He had escaped from the prison without the knowledge of any man. And when the king saw him, he said to him, \"Who brought thee hither, and who has released thee?\" \"My own wisdom and skill,\" answered the other; \"for I am not afraid of thee, nor of any of thy servants.\" The king forthwith loudly bade his servants to seize him, but they answered, \"We cannot see any man, although our ears hear him.\" Then the king and all his princes marvelled at his subtlety; but he said to the king \"I will go my way\"; so he went forth. And the king went after him; and the princes and servants followed their king until they came to the river-side. Then Alroy took off his mantle and spread it on the face of the water to cross thereon. When the servants of the king saw that he crossed the water on his mantle, they pursued him in small boats, wishing to bring him back, but they were unable, and they said, \"There is no wizard like this in the whole world.\" That self-same day he went a journey of ten days to the city of Amadia by the strength of the ineffable Name, and he told the Jews all that had befallen him, and they were astonished at his wisdom.\n After that the king of Persia sent word to the Emir Al-Muminin, the Caliph of the Mohammedans at Bagdad, urging him to warn the Head of the Exile, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, to restrain David Alroy from executing his designs. And he threatened that he would otherwise slay all the Jews in his Empire. Then all the congregations of the land of Persia were in great trouble. And the Head of the Captivity, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, sent to Alroy, saying, \"The time of redemption is not yet arrived; we have not yet seen the signs thereof; for by strength shall no man prevail. Now our mandate is, that thou cease from these designs, or thou shalt surely be excommunicated from all Israel.\" And they sent unto Zakkai the Nasi in the land of Assur (Mosul) and unto R. Joseph Burhan-al-mulk the astronomer there, bidding them to send on the letter to Alroy, and furthermore they themselves wrote to him to warn him, but he would not accept the warning. Then there arose a king of the name of Sin-ed-din, the king of the Togarmim, and a vassal of the king of Persia, who sent to the father-in-law of David Alroy, and gave him a bribe of 10,000 gold pieces to slay Alroy in secret. So he went to Alroy's house, and slew him whilst he was asleep on his bed. Thus were his plans frustrated. Then the king of Persia went forth against the Jews that lived in the mountain; and they sent to the Head of the Captivity to come to their assistance and to appease the king. He was eventually appeased by a gift of 100 talents of gold, which they gave him, and the land was at peace thereafter.",

    "Description":"Thence it takes twenty-eight days to the mountains of Naisabur by the river Gozan. And there are men of Israel in the land of Persia who say that in the mountains of Naisabur four of the tribes of Israel dwell, namely, the tribe of Dan, the tribe of Zebulun, the tribe of Asher, and the tribe of Naphtali, who were included in the first captivity of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, as it is written (2 Kings xviii. 11): \"And he put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes.\"\n The extent of their land is twenty days' journey, and they have cities and large villages in the mountains; the river Gozan forms the boundary on the one side. They are not under the rule of the Gentiles, but they have a prince of their own, whose name is R. Joseph Amarkala the Levite. There are scholars among them. And they sow and reap and go forth to war as far as the land of Cush by way of the desert.\n They are in league with the Kofar-al-Turak, who worship the wind and live in the wilderness, and who do not eat bread, nor drink wine, but live on raw uncooked meat. They have no noses, and in lieu thereof they have two small holes, through which they breathe. They eat animals both clean and unclean, and they are very friendly towards the Israelites. Fifteen years ago they overran the country of Persia with a large army and took the city of Rayy; they smote it with the edge of the sword, took all the spoil thereof, and returned by way of the wilderness. Such an invasion had not been known in the land of Persia for many years. When the king of Persia heard thereof his anger was kindled against them, and he said, \"Not in my days nor in the days of my fathers did an army sally forth from this wilderness. Now I will go and cut off their name from the earth.\" A proclamation was made throughout his Empire, and he assembled all his armies; and he sought a guide who might show him the way to their encampment. And a certain man said that he would show him the way, as he was one of them. And the king promised that he would enrich him if he did so. And the king asked him as to what provisions they would require for the march through the wilderness. And he replied, \"Take with you bread and wine for fifteen days, for you will find no sustenance by the way, till you have reached their land.\" And they did so, and marched through the wilderness for fifteen days, but they found nothing at all. And their food began to give out, so that man and beast were dying of hunger and thirst. Then the king called the guide, and said to him, \"Where is your promise to us that you would find our adversaries?\" To which the other replied, \"I have mistaken the way.\" And the king was wroth, and commanded that his head should be struck off. And the king further gave orders throughout the camp that every man who had any food should divide it with his neighbour. And they consumed everything they had including their beasts. And after a further thirteen days' march they reached the mountains of Naisabur, where Jews lived. They came there on the Sabbath, and encamped in the gardens and plantations and by the springs of water which are by the side of the river Gozan. Now it was the time of the ripening of the fruit, and they ate and consumed everything. No man came forth to them, but on the mountains they saw cities and many towers.\n Then the king commanded two of his servants to go and inquire of the people who lived in the mountains, and to cross the river either in boats or by swimming. So they searched and found a large bridge, on which there were three towers, but the gate of the bridge was locked. And on the other side of the bridge was a great city. Then they shouted in front of the bridge till a man came forth and asked them what they wanted and who they were. But they did not understand him till an interpreter came who understood their language. And when he asked them, they said, \"We are the servants of the king of Persia, and we have come to ask who you are, and whom you serve.\" To which the other replied: \"We are Jews; we have no king and no Gentile prince, but a Jewish prince rules over us.\" They then questioned him with regard to the infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the Kofar-al-Turak, and he answered: \"Truly they are in league with us, and he who seeks to do them harm seeks our harm.\" Then they went their way, and told the king of Persia, who was much alarmed. And on a certain day the Jews asked him to join combat with them, but he answered: \"I am not come to fight you, but the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and if you fight against me I will be avenged on you by killing all the Jews in my Empire; I know that you are stronger than I am in this place, and my army has come out of this great wilderness starving and athirst. Deal kindly with me and do not fight against me, but leave me to engage with the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and sell me also the provisions which I require for myself and my army.\" The Jews then took counsel together, and resolved to propitiate the king on account of the Jews who were in exile in his Empire. Then the king entered their land with his army, and stayed there fifteen days. And they showed him much honour, and also sent a dispatch to the Kofar-al-Turak their allies, reporting the matter to them. Thereupon the latter occupied the mountain passes in force with a large army composed of all those who dwelt in that desert, and when the king of Persia went forth to fight with them, they placed themselves in battle array against him. The Kofar-al-Turak army was victorious and slew many of the Persian host, and the king of Persia fled with only a few followers to his own country.\n Now a horseman, one of the servants of the king of Persia, enticed a Jew, whose name was R. Moses, to come with him, and when he came to the land of Persia this horseman made the Jew his slave. One day the archers came before the king to give a display of their skill and no one among them could be found to draw the bow like this R. Moses. Then the king inquired of him by means of an interpreter who knew his language, and he related all that the horseman had done to him. Thereupon the king at once granted him his liberty, had him clad in robes of silk, gave him gifts, and said to him, \"If thou wilt embrace our religion, I will make thee a rich man and steward of my house,\" but he answered, My lord, I cannot do this thing.\" Then the king took him and placed him in the house of the Chief Rabbi of the Ispahan community, Sar Shalom, who gave him his daughter to wife. This same R. Moses told me all these things.",

    "Description":"Thence it is seven days' journey to Khulam which is the beginning of the country of the Sun-worshippers. These are the sons of Cush, who read the stars, and are all black in colour. They are honest in commerce. When merchants come to them from distant lands and enter the harbour, three of the King's secretaries go down to them and record their names, and then bring them before the King, whereupon the King makes himself responsible even for their property which they leave in the open, unprotected. There is an official who sits in his office, and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it to him when he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. From Passover to New Year, that is all during the summer, no man can go out of his house because of the sun, for the heat in that country is intense, and from the third hour of the day onward, everybody remains in his house till the evening. Then they go forth and kindle lights in all the market places and all the streets, and then do their work and business at night-time. For they have to turn night into day in consequence of the great heat of the sun. Pepper is found there. They plant the trees thereof in the fields, and each man of the city knows his own plantation. The trees are small, and the pepper is as white as snow. And when they have collected it, they place it in saucepans and pour boiling water over it, so that it may become strong. They then take it out of the water and dry it in the sun, and it turns black. Calamus and ginger and many other kinds of spice are found in this land.\n The people of this country do not bury their dead, but embalm them by means of various spices, after which they place them on chairs and cover them with fine linen. And each family has a house where it preserves the embalmed remains of its ancestors and relations. The flesh hardens on the bones, and the embalmed bodies look like living beings, so that every man can recognize his parents, and the members of his family for many years. They worship the sun, and they have high places everywhere outside the city at a distance of2 about half a mile. And every morning they run forth to greet the sun, for on every high place a solar disc is made of cunning workmanship and as the sun rises the disc rotates with thundering noise, and all, both men and women, offer incense to the sun with censers in their hands. Such are their superstitious practices. And throughout the island, including all the towns there, live several thousand Israelites. The inhabitants are all black, and the Jews also. The latter are good and benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and Halacha.",

The waters remain upon the surface of the land during the months of Elul and Tishri, and irrigate and fertilize it.\n The inhabitants have a pillar of marble, erected with much skill, in order to ascertain the extent of the rise of the Nile. It stands in the front of an island in the midst of the water, and is twelve cubits high. When the Nile rises and covers the column, 0they know that the river has risen and has covered the land for a distance of fifteen days' journey to its full extent. If only half the column is covered, the water only covers half the extent of the land. And day by day an officer takes a measurement on the column and makes proclamation thereof in Zoan and in the city of Mizraim, proclaiming: \"Give praise unto the Creator, for the river this day has risen to such and such a height\"; each day he takes the measurement and makes his proclamation. If the water covers the entire column, there will be abundance throughout Egypt. The river continues to rise gradually till it covers the land to the extent of fifteen days' journey. He who owns a field hires workmen, who dig deep trenches in his field, and fish come with the rise of the water and enter the trenches. Then, when the waters have receded, the fish remain behind in the trenches, and the owners of the fields take them and either eat them or sell them to the fishmongers, who salt them and deal in them in every place. These fish are exceedingly fat and large, and the oil obtained from them is used in this land for lamp-oil. Though a man eat a great quantity of these fish, if he but drink1 Nile water afterwards they will not hurt him, for the waters have medicinal properties.\n People ask, what causes the Nile to rise? The Egyptians say that up the river, in the land of Al-Habash (Abyssinia), which is the land of Havilah, much rain descends at the time of the rising of the river, and that this abundance of rain causes the river to rise and to cover the surface of the land. If the river does not rise, there is no sowing, and famine is sore in the land. Sowing is done in the month of Marheshwan, after the river has gone back to its ordinary channel. In the month of Adar is the barley-harvest, and in the month of Nisan the wheat-harvest.\n In the month of Nisan they have cherries, pears, cucumbers, and gourds in plenty, also beans, peas, chickpeas, and many kinds of vegetables, such as purslane, asparagus, pulse, lettuce, coriander, endive, cabbage, leek, and cardoon. The land is full of all good things, and the gardens and plantations are watered from the various reservoirs and by the river-water.\n The river Nile, after flowing past (the city of) Mizraim, divides into four heads: one channel proceeds in the direction of Damietta, which is Caphtor, where it falls into the sea. The second channel flows to the city of Reshid (Rosetta), which is near Alexandria, and there falls into the sea; the third channel goes by way of Ashmun, where it falls into the sea; and the fourth channel goes as far as the frontier of Egypt. Along both banks of these four river-heads are cities, towns and villages, and people visit these places either by ship or by land. There is no such thickly-populated land as this elsewhere. It is extensive too and abundant in all good things.",

The number of Jewish inhabitants is about 7,000. Two large synagogues are there, one belonging to the men of the land of Israel and one belonging to the men of the land of Babylon. The synagogue of the men of the land of Israel is called Kenisat-al-Schamiyyin, and the synagogue of the men of Babylon is called Kenisat-al-Irakiyyin. Their usage with regard to the portions and sections of the Law is not alike; for the men of Babylon are accustomed to read a portion every week, as is done in Spain, and is our custom, and to finish the Law each year; whilst the men of Palestine do not do so, but divide each portion into three sections and finish the Law at the end of three years. The two communities, however, have an established custom to unite and pray together on the day of the Rejoicing of the Law, and on the day of the Giving of the Law[184]. Among the Jews is Nethanel the Prince of\n \n Princes and the head of the Academy, who is the head of all the congregations in Egypt[185]; he appoints Rabbis and officials, and is attached to the court of the great King, who lives in his palace of Zoan el-Medina, which is the royal city for the Arabs. Here resides the Emir al Muminin, a p.99descendant of Abu Talib. All his subjects are called \"Alawiyyim[186],\" because they rose up against the Emir al Muminin al Abbasi (the Abbaside Caliph) who resides at Bagdad. And between the two parties there is a lasting feud, for the former have set up a rival throne in Zoan (Egypt).",

The houses, the palaces, and the walls are of excellent architecture. Outside the town is the academy of Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander. This is a large building, standing between other academies to the number of twenty, with a column of marble between each. People from the whole world were wont to come hither in order to study the wisdom of Aristotle the philosopher. The city is built over a hollow4 by means of arches. Alexander built it with great understanding. The streets are wide and straight, so that a man can look along them for a mile from gate to gate, from the gate of Reshid to the gate by the sea.\n \n [See passage on Harbor.]\n \n Alexandria is a commercial market for all nations. Merchants come thither from all the Christian kingdoms: on the one side, from 6the land of Venetia and Lombardy, Tuscany, Apulia, Amalfi, Sicilia, Calabria, Romagna, Khazaria, Patzinakia, Hungaria, Bulgaria, Rakuvia (Ragusa?), Croatia, Slavonia, Russia, Alamannia (Germany), Saxony, Danemark, Kurland? Ireland? Norway (Norge?), Frisia, Scotia, Angleterre, Wales, Flanders, Hainault? Normandy, France, Poitiers, Anjou, Burgundy, Maurienne, Provence, Genoa, Pisa, Gascony, Aragon, and Navarra, and towards the west under the sway of the Mohammedans, Andalusia, Algarve, Africa and the land of the Arabs: and on the other side India, Zawilah, Abyssinia, Lybia, El-Yemen, Shinar, Esh-Sham (Syria); also Javan, whose people are called the Greeks, and the Turks. And merchants of India bring thither all kinds of spices, and the merchants of Edom buy of them. And the city is a busy one and full of traffic. Each nation has an inn of its own.\n By the sea-coast there is a sepulchre of marble on which are engraved all manner of beasts and birds; an effigy is in the midst thereof, and all the writing is in ancient characters, which no one knows now. Men suppose that it is the sepulchre of a king who lived in early times before the Deluge. The length of the sepulchre is fifteen spans, and its breadth is six spans. There are about 3,000 Jews in Alexandria.",

    "Description":"New York has been called the most American city in the United States. I can only say, that one moment I was reminded of England, and in the next of France. The private houses are, however, almost all built in the English style, with the differences of the front door being reached from the street by a flight of eight or ten steps, and that of the drawing and dining rooms being almost invariably on the ground floor, and opening into one another. The afternoon being fine, we took a drive round the Central Park, a space of about one thousand acres, in what will probably, by the end of this century, be the middle of the city of New York. The park has been laid out with great skill in landscape gardening, the artist having ably availed himself of the natural rock which comes frequently to the surface, and created one or two beautiful sheets of water. The trees, from not having been planted more than twenty years, are still rather small; but the park is kept in admirable order, and intersected by excellent roads and walks, while the roadway of most of the streets of New York, and indeed of most of the American and Canadian cities that I have seen, is execrable and filthy. I could not help remarking the lightness and elegance of the American carriages of all descriptions, and cannot understand why we in England have never adopted a style of carriage building, which seems to be as strong as ours, and would certainly be the saving of a great deal of useless labour to our horses. After a stay of two days in New York, and having experienced a specimen of its climate, the thermometer having fallen nearly thirty degrees in the space of four or five hours, and the weather having become bitterly cold, we intended to avail ourselves of the steamer to\nascend the Hudson for one hundred miles.",

The town stands upon what is nearly a dead flat, for it is not on the shores of the great lakes of North America, that we must look for picturesque scenery; and except a cathedral and a university it seems to have no public buildings of importance. A large proportion of the inhabtiants are of Scotch and Northern Irish birth or extraction, and the Province of Ontario has, I believe, but few French Canadians, and still fewer Germans within its limits. Settlers of the latter nation abound, as is well known, in many parts of the United States, and are said to number upwards of three hundred thousand in the city of New York alone. The wages of a working man are considerably lower in the Province of Ontario than in the adjoining State of New York, where a man will get three-and-a-half dollars per day, against two dollars on the Canadian side.",

This city, which shortly after our departure, suffered from a fire second only in its disastrous effects to that of Chicago, was by far the most English looking town I had yet seen in America. The older portions of Boston seem to have been modelled after the City of London, and Beacon Street and The Common are almost fac-similes of our Piccadilly and Green Park. In the Public Garden adjoining the Common, is a fine bronze equestrian statue of General Washington, by Ball. I mention this, because as far as I have seen, Washington, like some great men in our own country, has not, generally speaking, been fortunate in the statues erected to his memory. As it was the eve of the Presidential election, politics, as might have been expected, ran pretty high at Boston during our stay.",

    "Description":"To be the capital of a great country it must be owned that Washington is an extraordinary looking place. It has no trade, and the Potomac, on whose banks it stands, though a tidal river, is only navigable for vessels of light draught. The climate being excessively hot in summer, and often very cold and windy in winter, the streets have been judiciously laid out in straight lines, and with an enormous breadth, so as to secure to passengers the full benefit of wind, dust, mud, and a burning sun, according to the season. As regards the mud, however, I am bound to add that very great efforts were being made at the time of our visit, by the employment of a host of negroes, to pave and asphalte the streets, so that in another year or so, a drive through Washington may be a pleasure instead of a punishment. These improvements unfortunately have had the effect of more than doubling the city taxation, which is still, I believe, on the increase. The houses which border these wide streets, are, with the exception of the public buildings, and of some few private houses, of the meanest description, being inferior to those of a secondrate provincial town in England. The same observations will apply to the shops, or stores as they are universally called in America. Their prices are at least, double what they would be with us, and their goods generally of inferior quality. The city, which, with its far more picturesque suburb of Georgetown, contains about one hundred thousand inhabitants, has no theatre worthy of the name, and no public drive or promenade. Having gone thus far in the way of depreciation, it will be only fair to state what may be said in the way of approval. The Capitol is a truly magnificent building. Placed, as it is, on the highest ground in the city, its lofty dome and walls of white marble form a conspicuous object from afar, and the impression of its grandeur is not diminished by a nearer view, though its architecture cannot be termed absolutely faultless. The finer front is unfortunately that which is turned from the city, and looks to the eastward.",

We found the roadways of Philadelphia even more rugged and uneven than those of New York, there being huge holes in the middle of the best streets, and the crossings were very bad. The railways are all on the level, and the locomotives with their great clanging bells in place of whistles, are mixed up with the “street cars” and “stages.” The trams were all drawn by horses or mules, and none of them had seats on the top, as at Hamburg and other European cities, where a fine view of the neighbourhood can be taken at a small cost by riding to the various suburbs upon a steam or horse-drawn car. We had a splendidly clear day for inspecting the largest city in area in the country, and second in population, there being nearly a million inhabitants. Brook Street is twenty-three miles long, and it and Market Street are fine thoroughfares, but the other streets are poor, and have all the objectionable points of American cities—open drains, filthy and rotten wooden shades over the footpaths, rough telegraph posts, &c.",

A peculiar sight was a a hill composed of hundreds of tons of oystershells which are disposed of to make roads, or burnt to make excellent lime.

    "Description":"Right gay was the city of Washington as we ascended the steps to the back door of the Capitol. For be it known that this pretentious erection turns its back upon the city, the sixtons statue of Liberty, which tops the dome, facing the other way. The grand bronze doors cast at Munich—the principal façade, and the portico whence each new President is proclaimed, are at the further side of the building. This is explained by the fact that it was intended for the heart of the legislative metropolis to lie to the east of the Capitol, and for the White House, a mile and a half to the west, to be a retired residence for the President away in the suburbs. Very few houses have, however, been built to the eastward, the avenues laid out towards the west having been built upon in a spread-out fashion. Washington selected the site himself, and it was laid out according to his plan, but as the eighty intervening years have passed over with only a comparatively small amount of building going on—and that mostly where the outskirts were intended to be—the city covers a very large area for its population of only a hundred and fifty thousand. Hence its “Magnificent Distances” title. The prospect from the balconies of the Capitol is an extensive and pleasing one, the absence of smoke, owing to the use of anthracite coal, allowing a clear view for many miles. The main thoroughfares, radiating as boulevards like the spokes of a wheel from this centre-point, betoken the conception of a model city. One division of the circle has been kept entirely in the possession of the nation, and within it are the national conservatories and other federal institutions. An ugly railway station had been recently protruded into this reserved portion, but it was evident at a glance that sooner or later it would have to be removed. Every American is proud of Washington, and they all cried out against this eyesore. An unfinished column, intended to be crowned by a colossal statue of the Great General, stood far away, over in the Mall; but work was suspended owing to lack of funds. The Capitol is characteristic of the Americans, for, immense sums of money having been spent upon it, they mar the whole thing by stinting a few dollars upon it at the finish. The lamp-posts which adorn (?) the steps and balconies would be put to shame by an ordinary gin-palace gas lamp; and in front of the building is a dirty pool of water containing a few hungry gold-fish, and surrounded by a rusty iron paling, where a handsome fountain would fitly have decorated the approach.",

Settlements and farms there were; but, unlike those left behind us, they seemed to be swallowed up in the immensity of the boundless levels which rolled off to the horizon like the sea. For forty miles at one stretch was the railway as straight as if drawn by a ruler. Herds of antelope were feeding; and “villages,” as they call them, of prairie-dogs broke the monotony of the plains. We saw trains of emigrant waggons, bound Westward Ho, slowly drawn along by sturdy mules. These caravans were the straggling successors of the thousands of bullock, drawn waggons that wended in long trains up the course of the Platte in pre-railroad days, sometimes for miles actually in the shallow water or dry part of the bed of the stream. Scores of skeletons of oxen, and some in less advanced stages of decomposition (as many as a dozen could be counted in as many minutes), showed the small value of the carcases at this distance from populous places; neither skin, horns, nor hoofs being removed. As an example of the mode of life up in these regions Cheyenne may be quoted. Its altitude is six thousand and forty-one feet, and population about as many souls as it is feet above the level of the sea. Endless and poor-looking prairies surround it, and it looks as though snow in winter and dust in summer would be its chief characteristics; and its ostensible sources of income, supplying refreshments to travellers, and the carrying on of the waggon and locomotive shops connected with the railway.",

The country around is very flat, and is immensely productive of wheat. The soil is adobe, a shining black loam, which makes an almost imperishable sun-baked brick, of which most of the houses are built, and then plastered. What are sometimes no ornament to the Californian landscape are here made as picturesque as possible, namely, the windmills working the artesian wells. Every house has one, and the numerous wands are prettily coloured, and, although looking rather gimcrack, they are far from ugly appendages to the widely spread-out buildings and gardens. The guide books dignify Stockton with the title of the City of Windmills, and Don Quixote would indeed have found here a rare field for glory.",

Here and there are palatial residences, and well-treed suburbs and level roads border the railway. Nearer to the end of our ride, warehouses, distant masts of shipping, and high grain elevators crowded the view, there being every evidence that we were indeed entering a mighty mercantile city; and so it proved to be, for of all the inhabited places of the earth affording reminders of Jonah's gourd, Chicago is the most striking. Like many places of older growth, she has benefited in architectural and sanitary respects by what was a dire disaster at the time—a great conflagration. Here is a veritable Phœnix begotten of the ashes. The structures destroyed by the 1871 fire have been replaced by buildings that look to be everlasting, and the grand thoroughfares have the roadways paved with wooden blocks as in our own towns, and the sidewalks were, at the time of our going through, having their wooden planking rapidly superseded by flagging, the like of which could not be found in the world. Miles of it were already laid in State Street and the other magnificent streets parallel with, and intersecting at right angles, that splendid artery of traffic—huge blocks of stone, twelve feet by ten, and a foot thick, securely set, and needing no curbstone. The number and size of good shops is not equalled in the States. A book depôt which we patronised was a perfect library, and museum of books; its systematic arrangement and the scholastic attainments of the male and female attendants being nothing less than wonderful. It would have taken days to go through its well-contrived stands upon the ground floor and in the numerous galleries. The situation of Chicago is undoubtedly a super-advantage to it, and, with the exception that it is not one of the direct receiving ports of immigrants from across the seas, it has all the elements of a capital in a higher degree than New York, and will one day run her close in being practically the metropolis.",

    "Description":"After a ride of three hours by rail, having passed the town of Hamilton about noon, we arrived at Toronto, a well-built city of nearly a hundred thousand inhabitants. One of its features is a long strip of an island lying out in the lake (Ontario) about two miles from the shore, where many of the Torontonians reside during the summer, leading a kind of “camping out” life. The lake-side situation of Toronto is effective, and the country around is highly cultivated and picturesque. An utter absence of paving or macadam causes all the streets to be perfect bogs in wet weather, and the Wooden sidewalks, although cleanly, and good to walk upon where not worn into holes, are not consistent with the pretensions of the architecture. A prominent part of the town is spoken of as the “Four Ations.” This appellation was explained to us by the fact of the corner buildings being respectively the Government House, Upper Canada College, a Scottish Presbyteyian Church, and—a public house; some local wag having immortalized them as Legislation, Education, Salvation, and D—ation. He must have been an irreverent and rabid teetotaler, or else he would have managed short of having recourse to profane language by making the fourth word Intoxication, or, better still, Liquid ation. We did not see more than the solid brick exterior of the educational institution mentioned; but were shown over the University of Toronto, a pleasing gray rubble building of true Norman architecture with bold facings of a lighter coloured stone, forming three sides of a quadrangle. The natural history museum and handsome well-stocked library were exceedingly well arranged. In the lecture hall we saw from the gallery some dozens of male students—and one female—grinding away at formidable-looking “papers,” which were handed in as fast as completed to the examiners sitting stern and awe-inspiring on the dais at the farther end of the room. The University building is surrounded by a well wooded park which contains an interesting monument erected by the students to their fellow volunteers who fell in repelling the Fenian raids of 1866. It is a massive stone column surmounted by a colossal statue of Britannia, and looks very handsome surrounded as it is by sombre-hued evergreens. Another example of pure Norman style that it would be difficult to find excelled among modern buildings in Europe, is St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church; in fact the public edifices of Toronto struck us as being decidedly above the average for a place of its size. Doubtless it will shortly mend its ways in the matter of pavements, when, with its handsome shade-trees and well laid-out plots, it will take that rank for beauty, which, as being second in population to Montreal, might be expected of it.",

I am quite prepared to believe it. However, an hour's journey by rail and then a quarter of an hour's sleigh ride will take you from Buffalo within sight of this, perhaps the grandest piece of scenery in the world. Words cannot describe it. You spend a couple of hours visiting every point of view. You are nailed, as it were, to the ground, feeling like a pigmy, awestruck in the presence of nature at her grandest. The snow was falling thickly, and though it made the view less clear, it added to the grandeur of the scene. I went down by the cable car to a level with the rapids and the place where poor Captain Webb was last seen alive; a presumptuous pigmy, he, to dare such waters as these. His widow keeps a little bazaar near the falls and sells souvenirs to the visitors. It was most thrilling to stand within touching distance of that great torrent of water, called the Niagara Falls, in distinction to the Horseshoe Falls, to hear the roar of it as it fell. The idea of force it gives one is tremendous. You stand and wonder how many ages it has been roaring on, what eyes besides your own have gazed awestruck at its mighty rushing, and wonder if the pigmies will ever do what they say they will; one day make those columns of water their servants to turn wheels at their bidding.",

On the right the waterfalls, on the left, on the top of a high and almost perpendicular rock, the Houses of Parliament, a grand pile of buildings in gray stone, standing out clear against a cloudless, intense blue sky. The Russell is one of those huge babylonian hotels so common on the American continent, where unfortunately the cookery is not on a level with the architectural pretensions; but most of the leading Canadian politicians are boarding here while Parliament is sitting, and I am interested to see them. After visiting the beautiful library and other parts of the government buildings, I had the good luck to hear, in the House of Representatives, a debate between Mr. Chapleau, a minister and one of the leaders of the Conservatives now in office, and Mr. Laurier, one of the chiefs of the Opposition. Both gentlemen are French. It was a fight between a tribune and a scholar; between a short, thickset, long-maned lion, and a tall, slender, delicate fox.",

    "Description":"New Orleans is the twelfth city of the States. In my “citizen” days it was the fourth, ranking after New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. It is the chief city of Louisiana, and the most southern metropolis. After Liverpool, it is the largest cotton market in the world, handling 2,000,000 bales annually, and is the third of American seaports. The population is about the same as Edinburgh, 242,039 (winter, 260,000), the percentage of nationalities being —Anglo-American, 18 per cent.; French, 17; German, 15; Irish, 14; Italian, 8; Spanish, 2.3; and 25 per cent. coloured, or 177,376 white and 14,663 coloured. Baton Rouge, a quaint old place 89 miles up the river, with a population of 10,478, is the State capital In latitude 29.56 and longitude 90.4 w., New Orleans is 106 to 108 miles from the Delta of the Mississippi, in the Gulf of Mexico, and is one of the most picturesque and interesting cities in America owing to the survival of the buildings, manners, and customs of the original French and Spanish. G. W. Cable describes it as “a city of villas and cottages, of umbrageous gardens intersected by 470 miles of unpaved streets shaded by forest trees, haunted by song-birds, fragrant with a wealth of flowers that never fails a day in the year, and abundant in season with fruit—the fig, plum, pomegranate, and orange.” The Creoles are “a handsome, graceful, and intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type.” Its history begins with the mention of the Mississippi being traversed by white men (Spaniards) in 1536, then in 1539–41–42–43; with the settlement of French in 1699, the city being founded by Bienville in 1718, and passing under Spanish domination 1764–1801. It was then Americanised by purchase, 1803; besieged in 1812 by the British, being the scene of battle in 1815, and taken in the Civil War in 1862. Its State was admitted to the Union in 1812. There are five parks, four libraries, four theatres, eighty public or private schools, fifty institutions (of which eleven are charitable), twelve insurance companies, ten railroads, twelve steamboat lines, thirty-four sea-going. Its exports are £248,000,000; imports, £50,000,000; bank capital, £2,000,000; and its valuation in 1894, £28,000,000; manufactures, £12,000,000; commerce, £88,000,000; revenue, £600,000; debt, £3,100,000 (steadily if slowly disappearing). There are twelve miles of water front. Since the '30's, when the city bade fair to reach if not outshine New York, there has not been such a spirit of emulation and enterprise as there is now. Public and private improvements are being carried out on a liberal scale. The conversion of 186 miles of streets into beautiful avenues, and transforming the car service from horse to electric, is costing £1,000,000,—(one system was the first n the States)—and all around the least changeable is all change.",

This new district has until now been the fourth city of the United States in size and industrial interest, with 806,343 inhabitants in 1890. It is the “City of Churches,” and the “Dormitory of New York,” owing to so many city business men living there. It covers an area of 24 square miles, threaded with electric cars, and has five elevated railways within it, and three railway stations. The beautiful Prospect Park is the chief attraction for strangers. It has 550 acres, the lake being 60 acres in extent.",

Its streets are wide and straight, and its buildings in the business quarter so lofty as to be famous. To name the various public halls, art, educational, literary, and other institutes, municipal and commercial buildings, and state edifices, is to enumerate every kind of structure in any city except a Cathedral, although it has a Bishop. 600 students entered its University in 1892. Its public parks, embracing 1795 acres, form a green band round the city, and afford a continuous drive of 37 miles. Lake Shore Drive, Michigan Boulevard, and Drexel Boulevard, are fine residence streets, with tasteful houses and ornamental gardens. I must not omit to mention the Pullman car works, which constitute a model little town of 11,000 inhabitants, there being five or six thousand operatives in the works. The famous stock yards had no interest for me. Instead, I paid a visit to the University, where my friend Professor Smith was, and I also left my card of introduction at the Bishop of Chicago's City rooms. The trade of Chicago is second only to New York, and in 1892 was of 308 millions sterling value, its manufactures being 117 millions. 21,123 vessels entered or cleared Chicago in 1892, being 25 per cent. above New York. The Illinois Steel Co., of which Mr. W. R. Stirling, of the Brotherhood Council, was the vice-president, employs twelve thousand men, and the M'Cormick Company produces 120,000 harvesting machines annually. The many enormously tall edifices are really steel-framed buildings veneered with stone and brick, the lower ornamental walls being often filled in last. Their height is now limited to 150 feet. The rapid running elevators make the upper stories as accessible as the ground ones. I found it quite easy to have my hair cut twenty stories up without finding it standing on end. The airiness of the position was refreshing. Like New York, Chicago is not its own State capital, that being Springfield, Illinois, a town of only 25,000 inhabitants.",

At the Queen's Park, a wooded area of 40 acres, stands the massive buildings of the Provincial Parliament, costing £300,000, and the University of Toronto, the finest composition of college architecture in the Western Hemisphere. The main building, designed by Cumberland & Storm, costing £100,000, was burnt in 1890, but has been rebuilt, the architect of the restored building being Mr. Dick, once of Edinburgh, who hospitably entertained me as a friend of Mr. Hippolyte Blanc, R.S.A., and drove me round a good part of the city. 1300 students attend the University and College, and 300 that of Trinity College, an Anglican University.",

Like Washington it has thus had the opportunity to make itself worthy of the position to which it had been raised, and is already one of the handsomest and best kept cities of the Dominion. Like its States sister, too, it is the scientific centre of the country, with the headquarters of the chief scientific societies and collections, while the presence of the Governor-General constitutes it a natural focus of cultivated and fashionable society. The first settler established himself in 1800 on the opposite side of the river—the district now called Hull, with 11,265 inhabitants. Twenty years after he transferred his claim on the subsequently called “Bytown” side—the original name of Ottawa until it became a city. The inhabitants of Ottawa numbered 44,154 in 1891, and must now have risen to 50,000. They are nearly equally divided between French and British and Protestants and Roman Catholics. The Rideau and Chaudière Falls close to the city are very picturesque. The Rideau descends by six locks into the Ottawa River, picturesquely situated beside two bridges at acute angles.",

Its wide, finely laid out, asphalted streets, leafy squares and circles (some adorned with statues) and its shade tree avenues bearing names of different states, presents a system which deserves the name of city gardening. Pennsylvania Avenue, stretching a distance of a mile and a third, runs from the Capitol to the White House. The Capitol is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, 751 feet in length, and from 121 to 324 feet wide. The main edifice is sandstone, painted white, but the two wings are white marble. It occupies an area of 3½ acres. The park in which it stands is about 50 acres in extent. Its style is Classic, with Corinthian details. Opposite the central portico on the east side is a colossal statue of George Washington, and on the broad steps in front of the main doorway the inauguration of the Presidents of the United States takes place. The west side, upon which the city has extended, is approached by broad flights of steps, with a fine marble terrace. Sculpture and painting has contributed to perpetuate at the Capitol the political and historical events of the nation. The Hall of Representatives measures 139 feet by 93 feet, and is 36 feet high. There are desks for 352 members and 4 delegates. The size of the Senate Chamber is only 113 feet by 80 feet, the height being the same as the other chamber. It is more ornate than the Hall of Representatives. There are, of course, many Government buildings which were open to us, but the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the manufacture of paper money and bonds, and the Treasury Building, with its hundreds of millions of dollars in coin, appealed to the common interest of everyone.",

    "Description":"Philadelphia is the third city of the United States, but although it covers 130 square miles, and is 22 miles long by 5 to 10 wide, it has only 1,046,964 inhabitants, a large proportion of its houses being small; they are usually two storied structures of bright red brick, with white marble steps. It has 30 miles of water front on its two rivers, and is the headquarters of two great railway systems. Its steamers ply to various ports in the world. The names of William Penn and Benjamin Franklin are bound up with its history, and it is the scene of most important official steps, such as the Assembly of the first Continental (American) Congress, in 1774; the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776; the promulgation of the Constitution in 1787; and the place of assembly for Congress up till 1797. I saw in the Market Place the huge statue of Penn, 37 feet in height, which has now been raised to the tower of the New City Hall, 510 feet high. The huge pile covers a greater area than any other American building, being 4½ acres, compared with Washington Capitol, with 3½ acres. It has a granite basement story and white marble superstructure, and has taken twenty years to build. Its style is modified French Renaissance, and the building contains 750 rooms. The Council Chamber and municipal offices are on the first floor. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania occupies the third floor. Opposite the City Hall is the most handsome Broad Street Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in the same square stands the Masonic Temple, a great granite structure in the Norman style, costing £300,000, with tower 250 feet high. The lodge rooms are in seven different styles—Egyptian, Ionic, Corinthian, Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, and Oriental. The universally known Wanamaker's Store—the Bon Marché , Whiteley's, Jenner's, or Cranston's of Philadelphia—with 4500 employees, is quite near. Through this I had the privilege of being taken, dining there. The United States Mint, in Chestnut Street (which is the Princes Street of the City), is a white marble building of immense internal interest. The officials were magnanimously courteous, and some bestowed great attention upon me as a Great Britainer by pointing out things they knew would specially interest me. I was able from a very limited numismatic knowledge to correct a misplacement of a British coin in the unique collection, a hint they received with courtly deference. The Post Office is a large granite building in the Renaissance style, and cost £1,000,000. It contains other Federal offices, and the United States Courts. Independence Hall, the old State House, is only a brick edifice, erected 1729–34, but is perhaps the most interesting building in the States. It contains the famous Liberty Bell, the first rung in the United States after the Declaration of Independence, adopted in that\nHall. It cracked in 1835, and has been silent half a century (since 1843). Originally cast in England, it was recast in Philadelphia. The first American flag—thirteen stars and thirteen stripes—was made at No. 239 Arch Street.",

Although not possessing the commanding dignity of a castle upon a picturesque eminence, it has a beautifully laid out park in the very heart of the city somewhat relative as Princes Street is to the rest of the town. Boston Common, as the park is called, occupies 48 acres, shaded by fine elms and other trees, and, on account of its position near historic buildings and ground, it is entwined with the interests and affections of the surrounding population. There are also other parks of some importance. The city is perhaps the wealthiest in America in proportion to population. Its valuation in 1892 was £188,200,000. There are some public buildings of great interest and importance, and scientific, literary, and educational institutes, that indicate the higher culture of the residenters. Among a group of fine structures in a well-exposed area is the new Public Library, a dignified and imposing edifice, vis-à-vis to the noble Trinity Church, of which the late Bishop Phillips Brooks was rector, and where he preached the opening charge to the Brotherhood on the occasion of the Brotherhood Convention of 1892. Faneuil Hall, styled “the Cradle of American Liberty,” was the place of assembly of that Convention. Boston Public Library is known to be the largest of its kind in the world. It had 600,000 volumes in 1891, the circulation being 1,812,106 books in the year. Doubtless higher numbers can be quoted in its newer habitation.",

There are five parks, four libraries, four theatres, eighty public or private schools, fifty institutions (of which eleven are charitable), twelve insurance companies, ten railroads, twelve steamboat lines, thirty-four sea-going. Its exports are £248,000,000; imports, £50,000,000; bank capital, £2,000,000; and its valuation in 1894, £28,000,000; manufactures, £12,000,000; commerce, £88,000,000; revenue, £600,000; debt, £3,100,000 (steadily if slowly disappearing). There are twelve miles of water front. the Mississippi, in the Gulf of Mexico, and is one of the most picturesque and interesting cities in America owing to the survival of the buildings, manners, and customs of the original French and Spanish. G. W. Cable describes it as “a city of villas and cottages, of umbrageous gardens intersected by 470 miles of unpaved streets shaded by forest trees, haunted by song-birds, fragrant with a wealth of flowers that never fails a day in the year, and abundant in season with fruit—the fig, plum, pomegranate, and orange.” The Creoles are “a handsome, graceful, and intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type.” Its history begins with the mention of the Mississippi being traversed by white men (Spaniards) in 1536, then in 1539–41–42–43; with the settlement of French in 1699, the city being founded by Bienville in 1718, and passing under Spanish domination 1764–1801.

The speed, of course, is always the same, whether up or down hill, or on level ground. Telegraph Hill is 394 feet high, Clay Street Hill 376 feet, and Russian Hill 360 feet. A San Francisco Sunday is painful to one accustomed to our English ways; travelling in every form, and buying and selling are very prevalent. The Y.M.C.A. have a large building there, and get large meetings. I attended one gathering, which I addressed shortly. San Francisco is described as having “the mildest and most equable climate known to any large city in the world.” January is the coldest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 50°. September is the hottest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 58°. Thus only 8° difference between the coldest and warmest months, and the average for the whole year is 54°.

    "Description":"Omaha lies on the eastern boundary of Nebraska, opposite Council Bluffs, on the western bank of the Missouri River, a turbulent stream, which is never satisfied with its position, but is constantly shifting and changing, and making for itself new channels. A bottom land about three miles wide stretches out between Omaha and Council Bluffs, and through this the Missouri rolls, a swift, muddy stream, slowly but surely carrying the Rocky Mountains down to the Mississippi, which, in its turn, deposits them in the Gulf of Mexico, and helps to extend our Gulf coast. The Missouri vibrates like a pendulum, from one side of this bottom land to the other; now being near one city, and then near the other. At the period of my visit its current washed the front of Omaha, leaving Council Bluffs some distance off on the opposite side; but it was already beginning its backward swing. Thus the boundary line between Nebraska and Iowa is being continually shifted, and one State is augmented in territory at the expense of the other. Omaha is built in part upon the low bottom lands which border the river, and which may at any time be menaced by the swollen and angry stream, unless precautions are taken, in the building of high and substantial stone levees along the river front. The town lies also in part upon the table lands beyond, and is extending to the bluffs which rise still further away. Its business is chiefly confined to the lower portion, where magnificent blocks attest the prosperity of the city. Streets of substantial dwellings, and numerous most elegant private residences, with large and hand somely ornamented grounds, are discovered as one passes through the city. A striking edifice, of Cincinnati free-stone, four stories high, is occupied as a Post Office and Court House. Its High School building is one of the finest in the country. When the State Government was, in 1866, removed from Omaha to Lincoln, the Legislature donated the Square and Capitol Building at the former place for High School purposes. The old Capitol was demolished, and a magnificent school building erected on its site, at a cost of $250,000, while other fine school edifices, aggregating in cost about $150,000 more, were erected in other sections of the city. The High School building is on the summit of a hill, over-looking a large extent of country, and has a spire one hundred and eighty-five feet high. The Depot of the Union Pacific Railroad is also a noteworthy edifice.",

According to a circular of the Pittsburg Board of Trade, about twenty per cent., or one-fifth, of all the coal used in the factories and dwellings of the city escapes into the air in the form of smoke, being the finer and lighter particles of carbon of the coal, which, set free by fire, escapes unconsumed with the gases. The consequences of several thousand bushels of coal in the air at one and the same time may be imagined. But her inhabitants do not seem to mind it; and the doctors hold that this smoke, from the carbon, sulphur and iodine contained in it, is highly favorable to lung and cutaneous diseases, and is the sure death of malaria and its attendant fevers. And certainly, whatever the cause may be, Pittsburg is one of the healthiest cities in the United States. Her inhabitants are all too busy to reflect upon the inconvenience or uncomeliness of this smoke. Work is the object of life with them. It occupies them from morning until night, from the cradle to the grave, only on Sundays, when, for the most part, the furnaces are idle, and the forges are silent. For Pittsburg, settled by Irish-Scotch Presbyterians, is a great Sunday-keeping day. Save on this day her business men do not stop for rest or recreation, nor do they “retire” from business. They die with the harness on, and die, perhaps, all the sooner for having worn it so continuously and so long. Pittsburg is not a beautiful city. That stands to reason, with the heavy pall of smoke which constantly overhangs her. But she lacks beauty in other respects. She is substantially and compactly built, and contains some handsome edifices; but she lacks the architectural magnificence of some of her sister cities; while her suburbs present all that is unsightly and forbidding in appearance, the original beauties of nature having been ruthlessly sacrificed to utility. Pittsburg is situated in western Pennsylvania, in a narrow valley at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, and at the head of the Ohio, and is surrounded by hills rising to the height of four or five hundred feet. These hills once possessed rounded outlines, with sufficient exceptional abruptness to lend them variety and picturesqueness. But they have been leveled down, cut into, sliced off, and ruthlessly marred and mutilated, until not a trace of their original outlines remain. Great black coal cars crawl up and down their sides, and plunge into unexpected and mysterious openings, their sudden disappearance lending, even in daylight, an air of mystery and diablerie to the region. Railroad tracks gridiron the ground everywhere, debris of all sorts lies in heaps, and is scattered over the earth, and huts and hovels are perched here and there, in every available spot.",

    "Description":"The approach to Portland is more beautiful, even, than that to New York. The city is built upon a small peninsula rising out of Casco Bay, to a mean central elevation of more than one hundred feet. This peninsula projects from the main land in a northeast direction, and is about three miles long, by an average breadth of three-fourths of a mile. An arm of the Bay, called Fore River, divides it on the south from Cape Elizabeth, and forms an inner harbor of more than six hundred acres in extent, and with an average depth, at high water, of thirty feet. Vessels of the largest size can anchor in the main harbor, in forty feet of water at low tide. The waters of the Back Cove separate it on the north from the shores of Deering, and form another inner basin, of large extent and considerable depth. At the northeasternmost extremity of the Neck, Munjoy Hill rises to a height of one hundred and sixty-one feet, and commands a beautiful view of the city, bay, adjacent islands and the ocean beyond. At the southwestern extremity is Bramhall's Hill, rising to one hundred and seventy-five feet, and commanding city, bay, forests, fields, villages and mountains. The land sinks somewhat between these two elevations, but its lowest point still rises fiftyseven feet above high tide. The elevation of its site, and the beauty of its scenery and surroundings, are fast attracting the attention of tourists, and drawing to the city hosts of summer visitors. The peninsula is covered with a network of streets and lanes, containing an aggregate length of fifty miles, while it has thirty wharves to accommodate the commerce of the port. Congress street, the main thoroughfare of the city, is three miles in length, and extends from Bramhall to Munjoy. Running parallel to it for a part of its length, on the southern slope, are Middle street, a business street, devoted principally to the wholesale and retail trade; Fore street, the ancient water street of the city, but now devoted to miscellaneous trade; and Commercial street, which commands the harbor, and is principally devoted to large wholesale business. At the west end there are other streets between Congress and Commercial, including Spring, Danforth and York. Cumberland, Oxford, supplemented on its western end by Portland, Lincoln, along the shore of Back Cove, also supplemented on its western end by Kennebec street, are on the northern slope of Congress street. The cross streets are numerous. India street, at the eastern end, was the early site of population and business; Franklin and Beal streets are the only ones running straight across the peninsula, from water to water; Exchange street, devoted to banks, brokers' offices and insurance agencies, and High and State streets, occupied by private residences, are the principal ones. There is partially completed around the entire city a Marginal Way, one hundred feet in width, and nearly five miles in length.",

    "Description":"The manufacturing interests of Reading are second to no city of like population in the United States; while it is the third city in Pennsylvania in its manufactures, Pittsburg and Philadelphia alone exceeding it. Among these manufactures the working of iron holds the first rank. Much of the ore is obtained from Penn's Mountain, on the east of the town. Rolling mills, machine shops, car shops, furnaces, foundries, cotton mills and hat factories, from their number and extent, establish beyond question the claim of Reading to be considered one of the first manufacturing towns of America. The shops of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad alone employ two thousand men. From an early hour in the morning the eastern bank of the Schuylkill rings out the discordant music of numberless factories, betokening the enterprise of her productive industries. Reading has, at the present time, a population numbering not far from fifty thousand. It is delightfully situated on an elevated and ascending plain, which rises to the eastward into Penn's Mountain, and to the southward into the Neversink Mountain. The city is abundantly supplied with pure water, by streams flowing from these mountains. It is surrounded by a rich farming country, which looks to it for supplies. The streets cross each other at right angles, and the chief hotels and stores are built around Penn's Square, which occupies the centre of the city. It contains thirty-one churches, most prominent among which is Trinity, German Lutheran, an antique building with a spire two hundred and ten feet in height. Christ Church, Episcopal, is a handsome Gothic edifice of more recent date, and with a spire nearly as high. The Grand Opera House and Mishler's Academy of Music furnish amusements for the pleasure-seekers of the city.",

    "Description":"Providence is the second city of New England in respect to wealth and population. It is pleasantly located at the head of Narragansett Bay, thirty-five miles from the ocean. Its commercial advantages are unsurpassed, and as a manufacturing town it ranks among the first in the Atlantic States. The city is divided into two unequal portions by a narrow arm of the Bay, which terminates near the geographical centre of the town, in a beautiful elliptical sheet of water, about one mile in circumference, called the cove, or basin. This basin is inclosed by a handsome granite wall, capped by a substantial and ornamental iron fence, and is surrounded by a green about eighty feet in width, filled with a variety of beautiful and thrifty shade trees. The eastern portion of the city rises from the water, in some places gradually, in others quite abruptly, to the height of more than two hundred feet. This elevated land is occupied by elegant private mansions surrounded with numerous shade trees and ornamental gardens, making one of the most delightful and desirable places for residence to be found in any city. The western portion of the city rises very gradually until it reaches an elevation of about seventy-five feet, when it spreads out into a level plain, extending a considerable distance to the southwest. The northern portion, recently annexed to the city, is more sparsely populated, and portions of it are quite rural in appearance and abounding in hills, numerous springs and small streams of water. Providence is about forty-three miles from Boston, the same distance from Worcester, ninety miles from Hartford, fifty miles from Stonington, and twenty miles from Fall River, with each of which places it is connected by numerous daily trains. It also has railroad connections with New Bedford and southern Massachusetts, with Fitchburg, and thence with Vermont and New Hampshire. There is now in process of construction another route to Northern Connecticut, Springfield and the west. It is also closely connected with Newport, and other places on Narragansett Bay, by steamboats. Brown University is one of the distinguishing features of Providence, and, as an institution of learning, stands in the front rank of American colleges.",

    "Description":"Yet one who views Richmond at the present day, unbiased by the untoward circumstances which threw their baleful influence over us, will see much to admire in and about the city. It is situated on the north bank of the James River, about one hundred miles by water from Chesapeake Bay, and the same distance a little west of south of Washington. It is built upon several eminences, the principal ones being Shockoe and Richmond hills, separated by Shockoe Creek. Like so many other Southern cities, its residences are surrounded by gardens, in which are grass plots, shrubbery and flowers; and in the business quarter are many substantial edifices....The city is regularly laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles. Those parallel with the river are named alphabetically, A street being on the river. The cross streets are named numerically. The principal thoroughfare is Main or E street, which is the centre of business. The fashionable quarter is on Shockoe Hill, in the western part of the city, where are also the chief public edifices. The Penitentiary is in the western suburbs facing the river, and is a massive structure three hundred feet long and one hundred and ten feet deep. The Almshouse is one of the finest buildings in the city. There are a large number of churches, thirteen colleges, and an orphan asylum. Five bridges across the James River connect it with Spring Hill and Manchester, the latter a pretty town containing two cotton mills. The population of Richmond, by the census of 1880, was 63,803, which showed an increase of more than ten thousand persons in ten years. Unlike Charleston, S. C., it is surrounded by a populous rural region, whose products find a market here, and whose population look largely to the city for their supplies. It will never attain the commercial consequence of Savannah or of Norfolk, but as the centre of the tobacco region, and the seat of large manufacturing interests, it will always possess a certain importance and prosperity.",

Pleasantly situated on the Connecticut River, and enjoying now the advantage of exclusive legislation for the State, Hartford is destined to become one of the most important cities of New England. Authors, artists and publishers have ever found Hartford a fruitful field for the development of brains and enterprise. It is, perhaps, not exaggeration to say that in no other city of the United States of the same size is there so large a proportion of the population devoted to literature. The American and Hartford Publishing Companies, the firms of Burr, Scranton, Worthington, Dustin, Gilman and Company, and many others of less note, are located here. The new State House, now in process of erection, is destined to be one of the finest buildings in the country. The site commands a view of the city and its surroundings for many miles. Among the objects of interest to be found here are the residence of “Mark Twain” and the State Insane Asylum. “Mark's” house is at the end of Farmington avenue, on a little eminence, at the foot of which flows a nameless stream. Its style of construction is so unlike the average house that it has won for itself the characteristic title of “The None Such.”",

    "Description":"Eastern Pennsylvania is beyond question the finest section of the State: and the tourist who sojourns at Bryn Mawr, Downingtown, Bird-in-Hand, and many of their sister villages, will see abundant evidences of the wealth and prosperity of an industrious people. The country is sufficiently rolling to be picturesque, without any of the ruggedness which characterizes the central and western portions of the State. Sometimes from the car windows the roofs and spires of several villages may be seen in different directions, while substantial farmhouses with their commodious out-buildings, are on every hand. The land is brought to a high state of cultivation, and the entire region seems almost like an extensive park. Lancaster, the county-seat of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is situated on the Conestoga River, seventy-three miles from Philadelphia. This river, which is a tributary of the Susquehanna, is made navigable by nine locks and slack-water pools, from Lancaster to its mouth at Safe Harbor, eighteen miles distant. Considerable trade is brought to the city by its means; while Tidewater Canal opens up navigable communication to Baltimore, by way of Port Deposit. Lancaster was, from 1799 to 1812, the seat of the State government; it was incorporated in 1818, and was at one time the principal inland town of Pennsylvania. The oldest turnpike in the United States terminates at Lancaster, connecting that city with Philadelphia. It has now something more than twenty-five thousand inhabitants, largely descended from the early Dutch settlers, whose names are still borne, and whose language, corrupted into “Pennsylvania Dutch,” is still a most familiar one in that region. The city is principally a manufacturing one, producing locomotives, axes, carriages and cotton goods, and being particularly celebrated for its rifles. It has many fine buildings, both public and private. The Court House and County Prison will both attract attention, the former being in the Corinthian and the latter in the Norman style of architecture. Fulton Hall, near the Market-place, is a large edifice used for public assemblies. Franklin and Marshall College, organized in 1853 by the union of Marshall College with the old Franklin College, founded in 1787, is found on James street, and possesses a library of thirteen thousand volumes. It has a large number of both daily and weekly newspapers, and not less than fifteen churches.",

    "Description":"A rival of Chicago, Milwaukee shares with that city the commerce of the lakes, and is connected by steamboats with many points on the opposite side of Lake Michigan and with more distant ports. She is the lake terminus of a large number of railroads which drain an agricultural region of great extent and fertility; while her nearness to the copper mines of Lake Superior and the inexhaustible iron mines distant but from forty to fifty miles to the northward, contribute to make her a manufacturing centre. A single establishment for the manufacture of railroad iron was established, at a cost of a million of dollars. She has other iron works, and manufactures machinery, agricultural implements, car wheels and steam boilers, large quantities of tobacco and cigars; furnishes the Northwest with furniture, and has extensive pork packing establishments, while the products of her flouring mills and lager beer breweries find markets in every quarter of the United States, and have a reputation all their own. The rolling mill of the North Chicago Rolling Mill Company is one of the most extensive in the West...Milwaukee is known as the “Cream City of the Lakes,” this name being derived from the cream-colored brick of which many of the buildings are constructed. It gives to the streets a peculiarly light and cheerful aspect. The whole architectural appearance of the city is one of primness rather than of grandeur, which might not inappropriately suggest for it the name of the “Quaker City of the West.” The residence streets are shaded by avenues of trees, which add to the cheerful beauty of the town. The principal hotels and retail stores are found upon East Water street, Wisconsin street and Second avenue, which are all three wide and handsome thoroughfares. The United States Custom House stands on the corner of Wisconsin and Milwaukee streets, and is the finest public building in the city. It is of Athens stone, and contains the Post Office and United States Courts. The County Court House is also a striking edifice. The Opera House, used for theatrical purposes, is worthy of mention; while the Academy of Music, which was erected in 1864, by the German Musical Society, at a cost of $65,000, has an elegant auditorium, seating two thousand three hundred persons...No one who visits Milwaukee can fail to be struck with the semi-foreign appearance of the city. Breweries are multiplied throughout its streets, lager beer saloons abound, beer gardens, with their flowers and music and cleanly arbor-shaded tables, attract the tired and thirsty in various quarters. German music halls, gasthausen, and restaurants are found everywhere, and German signs are manifest over many doors. One hears German spoken upon the streets quite as often as English, and Teuton influence upon the political and social life of the city is everywhere seen and felt. Germans constitute nearly onehalf the entire population of Milwaukee, and have impressed their character upon the people and the city itself in other ways than socially. Steady-going plodders, with their love for music and flowers, they have yet no keen taste for display, and every time choose the substantial rather than the ornamental. Milwaukee is a sort of rendezvous for the Scandinavian emigrants, who are pouring in like a mighty tide to fill up the States of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Danes and Swedes, and especially Norwegians, stop here, and it may be, linger for a longer or shorter period, before they strike out into the, to them, unknown country which is to be their future home. Domestic service is largely supplied by the Norwegians, who prove themselves honest, industrious and capable.",

In our short journey from New York we passed over broad, level meadows, bearing some resemblance to a western prairie. The Passaic and the Hackensack rivers traverse these prairie-like meadows, while rising abruptly in the distance you behold the historic Bergen Heights. Disembarking at the conveniently located Market Street Depot, we sought and found a temporary home, and then lost no time in gratifying our native curiosity, by exploring the city and learning something of its origin and history. Newark is over two hundred years old, and yet is regularly laid out; its wide and well paved streets are adorned and shaded with grand old elms—some of them coeval with the founding of the city. Its chief business thoroughfare, Broad street, running north and south through the central part of the city, has many fine business blocks, and a finer avenue cannot be found than the south end of Broad street, lined with wide-spreading elms, and extending, apparently, into infinitude. One peculiarity that absorbed my attention, was the vast number of manufacturing establishments here, located, for the most part, outside of\nthe central streets, and these are doubtless the source of her prosperity.",

A novel sight, in my judgment, is a multitude of oyster plantations staked out in such a manner as to show the proprietor of each particular section his exact limit or boundary. To those of my readers who are familiar with hop-growing regions, I would say that an oyster farm is not unlike a hop field which seems to have been suddenly inundated by water, leaving only the tops of the poles 17 above the surface. Oyster raising is one of the leading features of New Haven enterprise, and the Fair Haven oysters, in particular, are regarded among the best that are cultivated on the Atlantic coast. On our return trip up the harbor the tide was going out, and as the water was extremely shallow in many places, and also very clear, we could see oysters and their less palatable neighbors, clams, in great abundance.",

It is divided into a lower and upper town, the former lying on the low shore between the bluff and the river, and containing the wholesale houses, shipping houses and factories. The latter occupies no less than four plateaus rising one above another, in a semicircle around the bend of the river, the first plateau being nearly a hundred feet in height. Here are the retail stores, public buildings, churches and private residences. The streets in the central portions of the city cross one another at right angles, but become irregular as they approach the boundaries. They are graded and paved and lighted by gas. Two bridges connect the opposite shores of the river, and horse cars traverse all sections of the city. Its general appearance is pleasing in the extreme. Many of the houses are built of blue limestone, which is found underlying one of the terraces in great quantities. The State Capitol building is now in process of construction, and will, when completed, be a very handsome edifice, occupying an entire square. The United States Custom House, an opera house, a large number of handsome churches, and several public school buildings are among the objects worthy of note in the city. Although Saint Paul is settled largely by people from New England and New York State, the Roman Catholics still hold an important place in the city. The first to take possession of the spot, they will be the last to relax their hold. They have a number of large and handsomely finished church edifices, and have established an orphan asylum. There is also a Protestant orphan asylum, and three free hospitals.",

The streets are one hundred and twenty-eight feet wide, crossing each other at right angles, an eighth of a mile apart, each square thus formed containing ten acres. Each square is divided into eight lots, measuring ten by twenty rods, and containing one-fourth of an acre. Several of the squares in the business quarter of the town have been cut across since the original laying out, forming cross streets. The streets are lined with trees, while streams of running water course down each side of every street, being brought from the neighboring mountains, ten thousand feet high, furnishing a pure water supply, and irrigating the gardens. Almost every lot has an orchard of pear, apple, plum, apricot, and peach trees, and Utah furnishes large quantities of fresh and dried fruit for the eastern markets. Apricots, which in the east are almost unknown, sometimes grow as large as eastern peaches, from six to eight inches in circumference. Locust, maple and box-elder are the favorite shade trees, and these grow luxuriantly. When, however, their roots strike soil from which the alkali has not yet been washed, their leaves turn from a dark green to a sickly yellow. But irrigation washes out this alkali, and the trouble from it grows less every year. Salt Lake City is divided into twenty wards, nearly every one of which has a square. Every ward has its master, who superintends the public improvements, and sees that every man does his share without shirking. The houses are generally of adobe (sundried bricks), though a few of the newer business blocks are handsome and commodious stone structures. Most of the dwelling houses are small, and but a single story in height, having separate entrances when there is more than one wife in the family. The city is not an imposing one. The wide streets, large grounds around each dwelling, and low, small houses, give it more the appearance of an overgrown village than that of a city. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the plan upon which it is built secures to its inhabitants the maximum of comfort, health and cleanliness. There are no narrow and stifling streets, overshadowed by tall buildings; no dirty alleys; no immense crime and pestilence-breeding tenement houses. Each little dwelling has its garden and orchard, securing to each family the blessings of fresh vegetables and fruit, and making each in a measure self-dependent. The air is pure, blowing down the valley from the mountain heights; and no foul vapors from half protected sewers or reeking courts poison it. The chief business thoroughfares are Main and Temple streets. The former is entirely devoted to trade, while church edifices are found in the latter. The Tabernacle is, of course, the most prominent object which meets the eye of the traveler as he arrives in Salt Lake City, standing out, as it does, in all its huge proportions, surrounded by the tiny homes of the people. It is on Temple street, in the heart of the city, and is entirely without architectural beauty, its predominant features being its hugeness and its ugliness. It is an enormous wooden structure, oval in form, with an immense dome-like roof, supported by forty-six sandstone pillars. It will seat fifteen thousand persons, and is used for the services of the church, lectures and public gatherings. It contains one of the largest organs in America. It is inclosed within a high wall, and a little to the east of it, within the same inclosure, are the foundations of a new temple, estimated to cost ten millions of dollars, but which will not probably be finished for many years to come. An inferior adobe building, also within the walls, is the celebrated Endowment House, where are performed those sacred and mysterious rites of the Mormon Church which no Gentile may look upon, and where the Saints are sealed to their polygamous wives.",

    "Description":"San Francisco is on a peninsula which extends between the bay of that name and the ocean. Its site is nothing more than a collection of sand hills, which, before the building of the city, were continually changing their positions. The peninsula is thirty miles long and six wide, across the city, which stands on the eastern or inner slope. San Francisco Bay is unsurpassed in the world, except by Puget Sound, in Washington Territory, for size, depth, ease of entrance and security. The entrance to the bay is through a passage five miles in length and about two in width, with its shallowest depth about thirty feet at low tide. Rocks rise almost perpendicularly on the northern side of the entrance, to a height of three thousand feet. A lighthouse is placed on one of 29 these, at Point Bonita. Fort Point, a fortress built on solid rock, commands the entrance from the south, and beyond it, until San Francisco is reached, are a series of sand dunes, some of them white and drifting and others showing green with the scant grass growing upon them. The entrance to the bay is called the Golden Gate, a name applied with singular appropriateness, since through its portals have passed continuous streams of gold since the discovery of the latter in 1848. Strangely enough, the name was given before the gold discovery, though at how early a date there seems no means of knowing....San Francisco Bay is about forty miles in length, its widest point being twelve miles. At Oakland, directly east of San Francisco, it is eight miles in width. Alcatraz Island, in the centre of the channel, six miles from the Golden Gate, is a solid rock rising threateningly above the water, and bristling with heavy artillery. It is sixteen hundred feet in length, and four hundred and fifty feet in width. Angel Island is directly north of Alcatraz, and four miles from San Francisco, contains eight hundred acres, and is also fortified. Midway between San Francisco and Oakland is Yerba Buena, or Goat Island, which, too, is hel as a United States military station. Red Rock, Bird Rock, the Two Sisters, and other small islands dot the bay.",

    "Description":"The Savannah River winds around Hutchinson Island, and the city is built in the form of an elongated crescent, about three miles in length, on its southern shore. It is on a bluff about forty feet above the stream, this bluff being about a mile wide at its eastern end, and broadening as it extends westward. Surrounding it are the low lands occupied by market gardens, for Savannah is a great place for market gardeners, and helps to supply the northern market in early spring. The streets of Savannah are laid out east and west, nearly parallel to the river, with others crossing them at right angles, north and south. They are wide, and everywhere shaded with trees, many of the latter being live oaks, most magnificent specimens of which are found in the city. Orange trees also abound, with their fragrant blossoms and golden fruit, stately palmettoes, magnolias and oleander, rich in bloom, bays and cape myrtles. The streets running north and south are of very nearly uniform width, every alternate street passing on either side of a public square, which is bounded on the north and south by narrow streets running east and west, and intersected in the centre by a wide street taking the same direction. These public squares, twenty-four in number, and containing from one and a half to three acres, are a marked feature of the city. They are placed at regular intervals, as already described, are handsomely inclosed, laid out with walks, shaded with evergreen and ornamental trees, and in the spring and summer months are green with grass. In a number of these are monuments, while others contain fountains or statuary. These squares or plazas are surrounded with fine residences, each having its own little yard, beautiful with flowers, vines, shrubbery and trees. In these premises roses thrive and bloom with a luxuriance unknown in the North, and the stately Camelia Japonica, the empress among flowers, grows here to a height of twelve or fifteen feet, and blossoms in midwinter. Savannah, the most beautiful city of the South, if not in the United States, is more like the wealthy suburb of some large city, than like a city itself. It i embowered in trees, which are green the whole year around; and shares with Cleveland, its northern rival in beauty, the soubriquet of the “Forest City\".",

A fine, large, brick and stone building, with plain exterior and artistically finished interior, is the Springfield Public Library. Over forty thousand volumes cover its shelves, and are so systematically arranged that the librarian or his assistants can produce at once any work named in the catalogue. The oblong reading room is furnished with black walnut tables; and winding staircases, painted in blue and gold, lead from the columned alcoves to the galleries above. The library owns some very old and valuable books of engravings. A room on the first floor is devoted to stuffed birds, geological specimens, preserved snakes, and a wonderful assortment of curious relies obtained from all parts of the world. Icelandic snow shoes and Hindoo gods occupy places on the same shelf, in peaceful proximity, and catamounts, paralyzed in the act of springing, glare at you harmlessly behind their glass cases. Patriotic mementoes are not wanting, as the bullet-riddled battle-flags of Massachusetts regiments will testify. The free public library system is distinctively a New England institution, and wields a mighty influence for good.",

Pilot Knob and Iron Mountain, both containing inexhaustible supplies of the useful ore, are not far distant. The lead districts of Missouri include more than 6,000 square miles. In fifteen counties there is copper. In short, within one hundred miles of St. Louis, gold, iron, lead, zinc, copper, tin, silver, platina, nickel, emery, cobalt, coal, limestone, granite, pipe-clay, fire-clay, marble, metallic paints and salt are found, in quantities which will repay working. In the State there are twenty millions acres of good farming lands; five millions of acres are among the best in the world for grapes; and eight millions are particularly suited to the raising of hemp. There is, besides, a sufficiency of timber land. With all these resources from which to draw, it would be surprising if St. Louis did not become a leading city in the West. Situated, as she is, on the Mississippi River, about midway between its source and its mouth, the junction of the Missouri twenty miles above, and that of the Ohio about one hundred and seventy-five miles below, and being the river terminus of a complicated system of western railways, the towns and cities, and even the small hamlets of the north, south and west, and to a limited extent of the east also, all pay her tribute. As Chicago is the gateway to the East, by means of the great chain of lakes and rivers at whose head she sits, so St. Louis holds open the door to the South and the East as well, through the Mississippi and the Ohio rivers.",

    "Description":"Syracuse is sometimes known as the Central City, on account of its location near the geographical centre of New York. It was first settled in 1787, and did not pass the limits of a small village until the completion of the Erie canal, in 1825. Two canals and three or four lines of railway now centre here, and contribute to the growth of this enterprising city. The region surrounding Syracuse is rife with the romantic history of that once powerful Indian Confederacy known as the Six Nations, now fast fading from the memory of men. The site of their ancient Council House was on Onondaga Creek, a few miles distant from the city, and is still held sacred to their traditions by the remnant of the lost tribes now occupying the Indian reservation. The principal street for retail business in Syracuse is named Salina, and it always wears an air of brisk trade and enterprise. The large dry goods houses of McCarthy and of Milton Price are located on this street. Some of the public edifices are built of Onondaga limestone, quarried a few miles out of the city. It makes very handsome building material, as the Court House and other structures will testify. The ranking hotels of Syracuse are the Vanderbilt and Globe, though the Remington, Syracuse and Empire Hotels are well-kept and well-conducted houses. The Erie Canal runs through the heart of the city, and the bridges over it are arranged with draws. The first steam canal boat I ever saw lay moored at this place, at the corner of Water and Clinton streets. It was gay with new paint and floating pennons, and created quite a sensation on its first trip out. It belonged to Greenway, the great ale man, and was named after his daughter.",

    "Description":"Toronto, the capital of the Province of Ontario, is situated on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, on a beautiful and nearly circular bay, about five miles in length, formed by a long, narrow, curved tongue of land, extending out into the lake in a southwest direction. This harbor is capable of receiving the largest vessels upon the lake, and is defended at its entrance by a fort upon the extreme end of the peninsula, which is called Gibraltar Point. This fort was thoroughly repaired in 1864, and mounted with the most efficient modern ordnance. The growth of Toronto has been more rapid than that of any other city in Canada. Though of such recent origin compared with many Canadian towns, it is now second only to Montreal in size and population, the former having increased from twelve hundred in 1837 to upwards of eighty thousand at the present time. The site of the city is low, the surrounding country being level, but free from swamp and perfectly dry. The ground rises gently from the shores of the lake. The scenery in the vicinity is tame and comparatively monotonous, though not unpleasing. The city lies along the shores of the lake for something over two miles, and extends inward about a mile and a half. As one approaches Toronto its outlines appear picturesque, being varied and broken by an unusual number of handsome spires. The traveler will be pleasantly surprised, as he enters the city, at the extent and excelence of its public edifices, the number of its churches, and its general handsome and well-to-do aspect. Many of the houses and business structures are built of light-colored brick, having a soft and cheerful appearance. The streets are laid out regularly, crossing each other at right angles, and, as a general thing, are well paved. In the winter time they are filled with sleighs, and the air is alive with the music of sleigh-bells...Five railways centre at Toronto, connecting it with every section of Canada, the West and the South. The principal of these are the Grand Trunk and Great Western railways, which connect the city by through lines with the East and West. While navigation is open magnificent steamers connect it with all points on the lake, and carry on an extensive commerce. It imports large quantities of lumber, both manufactured and unmanufactured; wheat and other grain, soap, salt and glue; while foundries, distilleries, breweries, tanneries, rope-walks, paper and flour mills, furnish products which reach markets throughout the Provinces and States.",

It is bounded on the west by the Hudson or north river, which is here above a mile in width, and on the east by the river of that name, which separates it from the populous town of Brooklyn, on Long Island. The point opposite the bay at the junction of the rivers, and called the Battery, from its being the site of the old Dutch fortifications, is laid out with taste as a park. or mall; the verdant foliage of which affords a most agreeable shelter from the scorching rays of the sun, and renders it a delightful and favourite promenade. The main street, called Broadway, is two miles and a half long, in a straight line, and proportionably wide, with broad flagged trottoirs or side-walks, some parts of which are shaded by poplars and other lofty trees; but in the quarter devoted to business, canvass blinds are stretched from the shops to permanent wooden rails of a convenient height and neatly finished. The architecture of the buildings, however, does not at all correspond with the magnificent scale of the street, the greatest irregularity prevailing; handsome edifices of brick, and even marble, of four and five stories, being side by side with those of two or three, and in some parts actually intermixed with miserable wooden cottages. Four of the largest episcopal churches, as well as the principal hotels and boarding houses, are situated in this great thoroughfare; and it is also the Regent Street for shops, or stores, as all depositaries of merchandise, whether large or small, are called. They are mostly of mean exterior, although furnished with every variety of goods from all parts of the world.",

    "Description":"Rochester, which we reached at noon on the third day, is in some respects the most wonderful place on the face of the globe. It was only founded twenty years ago, previous to which the country was a perfect wilderness. In 1815, the population but consisted of about three hundred persons; whilst in the year 1829, at the period of our visit, it had risen to thirteen thousand, and was rapidly progressing. The local advantages of Rochester are very conspicuous. Seated upon the fine river Genesee, which flows through a fertile country, and is navigable for barges nearly one hundred miles above, and for sloops from Lake Ontario, seven miles below, to within two of the town, intersected by the great western canal; possessing in abundance what the Americans denominate “hydraulic privileges,” but what in plain English would be termed inexhaustible water power: it is destined to become a place of great importance. The flour, or, as they are called, flouring, mills, are numerous, and several of them are erected upon a most extensive scale; one of these immense structures containing more than four acres of flooring. They were all in full operation, and are a source of much wealth to the place. I was informed that more than twelve thousand bushels of wheat were daily ground in these mills. The produce is chiefly sent to New York; but should the Montreal or Quebec markets offer inducements, the facilities of transport to those places are now very great, the water communication being perfected by the completion of the Rideau canal in Canada. The streets and public buildings are upon a handsome scale; and besides a number of large churches, banks, hotels, and other erections of an ornamental nature, Rochester has its athenæum, museum, and other scientific institutions. The most singular feature of this bustling infant town is the condition of the environs, which are still very much in a state of nature. The transition from a crowded street to the ruins of the forest, or to the forest itself, is so sudden, that a stranger, by turning a wrong corner in the dark, might either be in danger of breaking his neck over the enormous stumps of trees, which, as yet, there has been no time to Clear away; or, escaping that calamity, might soon be entangled in the labyrinth of wood which environs this unparalleled place.",

It has since been rebuilt, and is rapidly extending. Its situation, as the point of junction between the great western canal and Lake Erie, gives it immense advantages; and the day is not far distant, when Buffalo will become one of the most important places in the state. A commodious harbour has lately been constructed; and besides a number of schooners and trading sloops, steamers of large burden sail regularly during the season between this place and the various ports on the coasts of Lake Erie; among others to that of Cleaveland, the entrance of the Ohio canal lately finished, which, after passing for the distance of three hundred miles through the fertile and now populous state of that name, communicates with the great river Ohio, one of the grand tributaries to the Mississippi. These vessels also visit Detroit, a populous district, and occasionally make trips to the new settlements, as far as Lake Michigan, a distance of nearly one thousand miles. The neighbourhood of Detroit, which was founded by the French, nearly two centuries ago, was represented to me as being a most desirable location. The squares and streets of Buffalo are planned upon an extensive scale, and the buildings are pretty good. The Eagle Hotel, that at which we took up our quarters, is not only very large, but is equal in most respects to the best in Great Britain.",

The former river is rather more than a mile in width, opposite to the city; and the latter, something less than that of the Thames at London Bridge. The streets, excepting the two centre ones in each direction, are rather narrow, but perfectly straight, and cross each other at right angles at equal distances. Those from river to river are about two miles in length, and are named after different descriptions of trees, as Chestnut, Walnut, Spruce, Pine; while those in the contrary direction, the length of which is gradually prolonged with the increase of buildings, are numbered. The houses are of brick, and regular in their architecture. The steps, and the parts about the doors and windows, which, in England, are usually of stone, are of white marble; which, with the white painted doors, silvered plates and knobs, have a very chaste effect. The side walks are paved with brick, and are kept remarkably clean; and the shops are superior, as regards their external appearance, to those of New York; more of them also are devoted to the sale of engravings, and other branches of the fine arts, than in that city. Among the number of public edifices which adorn Philadelphia, the most interesting, although not the most beautiful, is the State House; for in one of its halls was signed the document which separated thirteen of the American colonies from Great Britain.",

    "Description":"The city of Washington, the metropolis of the United States of America, was founded, at the close of the last century, upon a section of land ten miles square, which was ceded by the States of Maryland and Virginia for the purpose, and which is now under the special government of Congress, and termed the District of Columbia. The plan of the embryo capital is at once grand and unique. Very long and broad avenues diverge from centres, and are intersected by streets at right angles. Only one of the former, however, and not many of the latter, contain any buildings; and these are, for the most part, as paltry as they are scattered, although the city contains a population of twenty thousand persons. The chief architectural ornament of Washington, and, indeed, of the Union, is the edifice called the Capitol, in which are the Chambers of Congress, the Supreme Courts, and the National Library. This noble building, which stands on a most commanding site, is 350 feet in length, and is surmounted by a lofty but heavy dome. The style of architecture is Palladian, and the material freestone; but, in consequence of the discolouration produced by the burning of the interior by the British, the whole of the outside has been painted white, —a very questionable proceeding as regards effect, to say nothing of the periodical expense which will be thereby incurred. The principal entrance, which is under a magnificent portico, opens into a circular hall or rotunda, one hundred feet in diameter, and exactly the same in height. The walls of this classical apartment are ornamented with large paintings by the venerable Colonel Trumbull, to whom I have before made allusion.",

Eighty years ago it contained not more than twenty or thirty mean tenements, and its shipping was limited to one small square-rigged vessel. The same place now numbers upwards of seventy thousand inhabitants, and its ships trade to every quarter of the habitable globe. Unlike New York or Philadelphia, the surface of the ground upon which the city stands is irregular. The streets are mostly at right angles, and of a good width; but they are not kept in neat order, and swine innumerable roam at large. The houses are built of excellent red bricks, quantities of which are exported to New York and other places.\nThe city contains several handsome public edifices; the principal of which, in point of extent, is the Exchange. This spacious building contains a noble hall for the accommodation of the merchants and others, who meet shaded from the burning suns of summer, or the cold blasts of winter. A gentleman, to whom I expressed my admiration of the beauty of this hall, remarked, as a singular circumstance, and as one that struck him on his travels, that the ports of Great Britain, the greatest commercial nation in the world, with its humid climate too, should not possess any mercantile places of rendezvous of this description open to the public.",

    "Description":"Boston, which has been founded two centuries, was originally called Tremont, or Tremountain, from the circumstance of its being situated on three hills. The city is almost surrounded by water; the connection with the main land being formed by a narrow strip called the Neck. The communication, in other directions, is kept up by timber bridges; one of which is no less than 1300 yards in length. The older streets are irregular — indeed, as tortuous as those of the old towns of England; but such as are of later date are laid out at right angles. They are kept in neat order; and, unlike the thoroughfares of all the other cities we had visited, they were not perambulated day and night by swine. Many of the original names have given place to others more congenial to the state of political feeling; thus, Washington has superseded Marlborough, and King and Queen have been metamorphosed into Court and State Street...It is not in the interior of the State House alone that the eye and mind are gratified. The view from the lofty dome, by which it is surmounted, is as extensive as it is picturesque; and full of historical interest, as regards the commencement of the glorious struggle, which terminated, happily for mankind, in American independence. At our feet lay the city, with its halls, and its sites, rendered memorable as the places where the intelligence and free spirits of the country discussed their wrongs, or gave vent to their outraged feelings in bold and energetic, yet peaceable remonstrances. Taking a wider range, in one direction the eye rested upon the blood-stained field, where a despotic government was taught, by a severe lesson, to respect the sacred rights of man; while, in another, it gazed upon those eminences, where the military genius of a Washington displayed itself, as if by magic, to the discomfiture of the retiring foe. The wide expanse of the unruffled bay, with its archipelago of islands, the undulated country, sprinkled with smiling villages, and cheerful habitations, together with the bold outline of the distant hills, all combined under an atmosphere as pure as it was mild, produced an enchanting picture, and one which is indelibly impressed on the memory. In front of the State House is a park, many acres in extent, which, in the colonial times, bore the name of the Common; but having been railed, and ornamented, is now dignified with the title of Mall. Here the British troops were for some time encamped; and near a huge and ancient elm, which still spreads its venerable arms, are the remains of a redoubt, thrown up at that period. Among the number of mansions which form one side of the streets bounding this beautiful verdant enclosure, that of the celebrated patriot, Hancock, is distinguished.",

There are several large stores in this town, which appears to be rapidly increasing. Our course now lay along the Illinois, the scenery of which is extremely beautiful, indeed superior to any of the kind which I had seen. The rocks rise abruptly from the valley of the river, at the distance of quarter of a mile on either side; some protruded here and there from the bed of the stream; the slopes were covered with wood, the foliage of which exhibited the most glowing tints of red and yellow; and the shrubs and herbage of the lower ground presented forms as beautiful as they were new to me. I have little doubt, that when the scenery of Ottawa is properly known and appreciated, it will be visited by crowds. About a mile below it, a town has been planned, which is to be named Gibraltar, on account of the abrupt rocks which rise in its vicinity. The grass on the flat land attains a height of six, or even sometimes nine feet, and in the waggon we were in a manner completely overtopped by it over a space of nearly three miles.",

Opposite to this fort is another, nearly on a level with the water, and from which, on the south side, the town stretches along the harbour, which is nearly a mile in length, and gradually enlarges, so as to form at its upper part a large basin, in which an hundred vessels may ride at anchor in perfect security, the water being deep, and complete shelter being afforded by the rising ground all round. The town stretches away from the harbour to some distance; its streets are narrow, parallel, and intersecting; and almost all the houses are of two stories, and castellated, so as greatly to add to the effect of the scenery.",

The lodgings, however, are very good, although the charges are very high, four dollars a week being taken, five shillings for breakfast, and six shillings and eightpence for dinner. The houses in the principal streets are detached, generally of two stories, and built of wood, with verandahs and flower-plots in front. The streets are wide, but very sandy, and not well kept.... The ground between the road and the harbour is marshy, and must in dry weather render Kingston very unhealthy, though for several years past there has been little fever there.

    "Description":"Skirting the coast, at a distance too great to permit of our noting its general appearance, we passed Cape Brett, situated at the entrance to the Bay of Islands, and steaming down the Hauraki Gulf, between the Great and Little Barrier Islands, soon entered Auckland harbour, where a remarkably pretty landscape was spread out before us. On one side lay the city, its outskirts extending on either side into the hills; while the wide expanse of the harbour, with its numerous inlets and islands, lay stretched out in front of it, seemingly landlocked, and resembling a large lake, surrounded by a background of green hills. Auckland is picturesquely situated in the North Island of New Zealand, at a point where its breadth is only six miles; and possesses two fine harbours. Waitemata, the principal of these, and along the shores of which the city is built, is very fine, and one of the safest in New Zealand. It is an inlet of the Firth of Thames, and consists of an inner harbour, almost landlocked by Rangitoto and Tapu Islands, containing good wharfage accommodation; and an outer bay of considerable extent, called Hauraki Gulf, protected by the Great and Little Barrier Islands. On the western side of North Island, and distant only six miles from Auckland, with which it is connected by a tramway, is Manukau harbour, on which is situated the small town of Onehunga, and from which most of the intercolonial trade is carried on. Auckland is regularly laid out, the streets being straight and wide, and crossing one another at right angles. Queen Street, the principal thoroughfare, extends a distance of a couple of miles from the wharves, and contains the principal buildings. The public buildings are generally good, built for the most part of brick, faced with stone; the most important being the Government Offices, the Post Office and Custom House, and the Supreme Court. Government House is a handsome edifice, erected on an eminence which commands a grand view of the harbour, and situated in the midst of ornamental grounds, containing many fine trees. Auckland contains something under 25,000 inhabitants. It is the second city in New Zealand, in point of population and commercial importance, and was, until 1865, the political capital of the colony; when it was found advisable to select a town with a more central position for the seat of Government, and the Legislature was removed to Wellington. Auckland has lost, in consequence, some of its former importance; but, from its unrivalled position, seems destined to become a great city, especially when the large tract of country occupied by the Maoris is brought under cultivation, and the railway system extended throughout the Island. It is at present a busy thriving place, and is rendered more characteristic of the country than other New Zealand towns by the number of the Aborigines or Maoris seen in its streets.",

Its appearance, viewed from the harbour, is remarkably picturesque, being embowered in luxuriant vegetation, with a background of volcanic hills of most irregular shapes, their sides covered with verdure, and their craggy peaks rising to a great height. In rear of the town is a peculiarly-shaped eminence called Punchbowl Hill, the summit of which is crowned by a small battery, to protect the harbour. The harbour consists of a roadstead and an inner basin; the former protected by a spit of land extending into the sea, called Diamond Head, and the latter accommodating at its wharves ships of very large tonnage—our steamer, a vessel of 3,200 tons register, being very comfortably berthed. The entrance to the harbour, as in most of the islands in the Pacific, is through a passage in the coral reef that extends round the island of Oahu. These passages through the reefs are supposed to be formed by currents of cold fresh water coming from the land, in which the coral insects that build up these reefs upon submerged portions of the islands cannot exist. Honolulu consists of regularly laid out streets, that have, however, more the appearance of wide, rural lanes, from the luxuriance of the vegetation in the gardens, and the number of beautiful trees standing between the houses. It contains some good public buildings, amongst which it is pleasing to see a public library, with 1,500 books of reference, and numerous churches. The king's palace is a plain unpretentious building of coral-stone, situated on about an acre of well laid out ground, surrounded by a high wall, at the entrance gate in which stands a native sentry, in his neat uniform of blue coat and white trousers.",

    "Description":"San Francisco , the chief city of the State of California, and the New York of the Pacific Coast, is situated at the end of a peninsula thirty miles long and six miles across, which separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. It lies at the foot of high hills, which, in the early days of the city, were cut up by numerous gullies, and the low land at their base was of small extent. Many of these hills have been levelled, the gullies filled up, and the narrow portion of the peninsula widened with land reclaimed from the ocean; thus there are now paved streets and busy thoroughfares, where once large ships rode at anchor. The city is regularly laid out, the streets being straight, broad, and crossing one another at right angles; the business portion is compactly built, and may be said to cover an area of nine square miles, lying between Telegraph, Rincon, and Russian Hills. It is substantially built, for the greater part, of stone; but the outskirts are straggling, the houses being wide apart, and generally of wood. The rapid growth of San Francisco is almost unprecedented, equalled only by that of Melbourne, Victoria, which owes its rise to the same cause, viz., the gold discoveries. The first house built on the present site of the city was in 1835, when the settlement was called Terba Buena, from a medicinal herb found in the vicinity; this was changed to its present name, San Francisco, in 1847. In 1848, when gold was first discovered, the population amounted to 1,000; the great immigration from the East then set in, and in 1850 the population had increased to 25,000; in 1860, to 57,000; in 1870, to 150,000; and is now estimated at over 175,000 inhabitants....The principal thoroughfare is Montgomery-street, which, with its fine blocks of buildings, is a very handsome street. It extends at its northern extremity to the top of a hill, too precipitous for carriages to ascend; but pedestrians can do so by means of a flight of steps, and from the top a fine view of the city and bay is obtained. Market and Kearneystreets are also fine thoroughfares, and contain many of the best retail establishments. In California-street are the principal banks and brokers' offices; whilst Front, Sansome, and Battery-streets form the centre of the wholesale trade of the city. The best private residences are situated in Van Ness Avenue, Pine-street Hill, Bush and Geary-streets. The traffic in some of these streets is very great, and forcibly reminds one of parts of the city of London.",

It very much resembles a large colonial up-country town, and is the seat of some rather extensive manufactures. It is a thriving and busy place, and, during the sessions of the State Legislature, swarms with numbers of political agents and hangers-on. The Capitol, or State House, is a noble building, in the Corinthian style of architecture, surmounted by a grand cupola, which renders it a very conspicuous object, from every point of the surrounding plains. It is, unquestionably, one of the finest edifices in the United States. Sacramento is the centre of a large railway system, and from it, lines radiate to all parts of the State; hence it seems likely in time, to become a large and important city. The streets are broad and well paved, and lined with trees, which form an agreeable shade in summer. The houses are generally built of brick, and have a substantial and pleasing look; whilst the recent erections are really handsome in appearance.",

A storm in these mountains, witnessed from the city, is a grand sight. Two peaks or summits, called the Twin Peaks, distant about 15 miles southeasterly, are 11,000 feet high, and have never been free from snow since the settlement in this valley. Salt Lake, that veritable Dead Sea, is 120 miles long, by about 45 miles broad, and contains seven islands. Its waters are so salt that nothing can live in them, and the fish that find their way down the rivers Jordan, and Weber, are soon killed. It is said, that enough salt to supply the whole world, could be obtained by evaporation. I took a sail on\nthe lake, but found its banks destitute of vegetation, and its dreary, barren, appearance uninviting. The rivers Jordan and Weber empty themselves into the lake, but there is no outlet; and the waters are said to have risen some 10 feet since 1850. A peculiar feature of Salt Lake is two rocks: one, a great mass, rising abruptly out of the water, and standing black and desolate, called Black Rock; the other, overhanging the margin, and bearing an indistinct resemblance to a human face, is called Profile Rock. Salt Lake City is situated at the foot of the Wahsatch Mountains, on a plain that has, by indomitable perseverance and toil, been converted from a wilderness, impregnated with alkali, and productive only of sagebush, into a smiling agricultural country, dotted over with the farms, or, as they are here called, the “ranches” of the settlers. A slight description of this most remarkable city may not be out of place, before I proceed to give an account of the people who inhabit it, and of the territory in which it is situated. Salt Lake City is regularly laid out in the form of the letter L; the larger portion stretching east and west, and the shorter north and south. The streets—as is usual in all new American towns—are wide, cross one another at right angles, and follow the cardinal points of the compass; but they possess an unique appearance, as they have brooks of clear water flowing down either side, and watering the roots of trees, planted so, as to cast a pleasant shade over the pathway. These shade-trees, bordering every thoroughfare, and the numerous orchards in, and around the city, give it the appearance of being embowered in foliage—very refreshing to the eye in the hot season. The city is laid out in square blocks of ten acres each, covers a space of about nine square miles, and contains a population of some 25,000 inhabitants; 20,000 of whom are Mormons, and the remainder Gentiles—as all are called who do not profess the faith of Mormon.",

    "Description":"Chicago is, in population, the third city of the Union; in commercial importance, it Tanks after New York; its population may be set down at 400,000. In 1830, it was only a trading station with the Indians, consisting at thattime of a few log houses only; and the city has attained its present proportions, since that comparatively recent date. What causes it, however, to be regarded as the most remarkable city in the world, is the fact, that since the great fire of 1871, the greatest conflagration of modern times—in which three and a half square miles of the principal part of the city were burned; in which 17,450 buildings were destroyed, and 98,000 people rendered homeless; the monetary loss of which, was estimated at little short of thirtyseven millions sterling, ten millions only of which, were coveredMby insurance—the city has sprung up like a phoenix out of its ashes, and now shows but few traces of the dire calamity. The buildings destroyed, have all been replaced by noble stone edifices; so that now Chicago may justly claim to be a “City of Palaces.” In 1874, another fire broke out in the devoted city, and six hundred acres of buildings were consumed; yet, in spite of these disastrous drawbacks, Chicago exhibits but few remains of either devastation. The position of the city is most favourable, being situated mid-way between the Eastern and Western States; on Lake Michigan, which gives it a splendid water-way. It is also the centre of a vast railway system, and has in consequence become the greatest grain emporium in the world, and also the largest cattle and lumber market. It has not been without straining every nerve, that the city has been rebuilt in such an incalculably short time; house rents are very high in consequence, and ratepayers obtain some concession, by paying their rates in advance. Chicago is well laid out, the streets being generally eighty feet wide; some of them are from three to seven miles in length, run due north to south, and east to west, and cross one another at right angles. The Chicago River runs through the city, and with its two branches, divides it into three parts; between which, communication is effected by means of thirty-three bridges. These bridges swing on central pivots, and have to be opened to allow vessels to pass; but as this is found to interrupt the street traffic, they are commencing to build tunnels, under the bed of the river. Two have already been completed; one connects the northern and western divisions of the city, and is 1,600 feet long; the other joins the northern and southern, and is 1,900 feet in length.",

    "Description":"Detroit is a clean and pretty town, containing many fine villa residences; it is situated on the Detroit River—a noble stream, twenty miles long, connecting Erie Lake with Lake St. Clair; and forming here, the best harbour on the whole chain of lakes. Detroit is the principal city of Michigan, and contains some 100,000 inhabitants; the river front for miles is lined with warehouses, dry-docks, shipbuilding yards, founderies, and grain-elevators; and the city is laid out on the usual American rectangular plan. The streets are broad; those containing the business premises vary from 50 to 100 feet in width; the avenues of private mansions from 100 to 200 feet. They are generally planted, with a double row of trees on both sides, and these beech, chestnut, oak, elm, and maple trees, all covered with foliage, give a pretty countrified appearance to the city, and form a most agreeable shade. The Campus Martius, a fine open space or square, is the principal feature in the arrangement of the city. Taking up the whole side of this square stands the City Hall, a noble stone building in the Italian style; consisting of three stories, above the basement, and surmounted by a Mansard roof. In the middle of the square is the Soldier's Monument; erected in memory of the Michigan soldiers who fell in the civil war. On the north side of the Campus Martius is the Opera House, one of the largest buildings of the kind, in the country. This square is crossed by Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and from it radiate Munroe Avenue and Fort-street. These avenues, for miles, are lined on both sides with detached, and semi-detached houses, each standing in its own garden. In the centre of the city is a semicircular park, called the Grand Circus, which is divided in two by Woodward Avenue, each part containing a fine fountain. The principal buildings are the Custom House, and Post Office, both under the same roof, and the Board of Trade. The Great Wheat Elevator of the Michigan Central Railway Company is a large building, from the cupola of which a grand view is obtained of the city, river, and Lakes St. Clair and Erie. The manufactures of the city are rather extensive, comprising ironworks, machine-shops for the construction of railway rolling-stock; flour mills, breweries, and extensive tobacco and cigar factories; the shipping interests are also large. Pork and fish-packing are carried on very extensively.",

    "Description":"Toronto is, after Montreal, the largest city of Canada; it has a population of 60,000; and is situated on a beautiful bay, the entrance to which is narrow, and protected by a long spit of land, called Gibraltar Point. The city has a very English appearance, and the streets, though not wide, are generally well paved. The principal are King and Yonge streets, which contain all the best retail establishments. Front street, containing large blocks of warehouses, is also a fine thoroughfare. The University of Toronto is a grand edifice, in the pure Norman style of architecture; the buildings forming three sides of a quadrangle. It is a noble institution, and one of which Canadians may justly be proud; it possesses a library of 20,000 volumes, and a fine museum of natural history. Adjoining the University is the Queen's Park, comprising fifty acres of well laid out ground; approached by long avenues of chestnut, beech, elm, and oak trees. In the park is a fine monument, surmounted by a large figure of Britannia; erected to the memory of those Canadians, who fell in repelling the Fenian invasion of 1866. The Post Office, built in the Ionic style, is a fine building; the City Hall is plain and unpretentious; the Custom House and Court House are handsome structures. Osgoode Hall is a very imposing, and extensive building of the Ionic Order; it contains the Provincial Courts, and has a fine law library. Amongst other buildings of a public character may be enumerated St. Lawrence Hall, the Masonic Hall, and the Exchange. Toronto is to Canada, what Edinburgh is to Scotland, the seat of its higher educational system; and contains many fine public schools, and colleges. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, is one of the principal, and most successful. Trinity College is a spacious building, with numerous turrets and quaint gables; and is situated in the midst of extensive grounds. The Normal School, for the training of teachers, the Model Schools, and the Educational Museum are plain buildings; but standing together, as they do, in a large park, they have a very picturesque appearance.",

    "Description":"Montreal, the commercial metropolis of Canada, is a nice clean city of 110,000 inhabitants, containing fine blocks of buildings; but especially notable, for the number, and beauty of its churches. It is situated on the Island of Montreal, which is thirty miles long, and ten broad, and is formed by the junction of the Ottawa, with the St. Lawrence. It is connected with the main land, by the splendid Victoria Bridge, called by Montrealers “the eighth wonder of the world.” This celebrated bridge is a mile and a half long, or with its approaches, nearly two miles; is supported upon twenty-four piers, and two abutments of solid masonry; the span between the centre piers being thirty-three feet. The iron tube, through which the lines are laid, is twenty-two feet high, and sixteen feet wide. This bridge ,was erected by Robert Stephenson, and though rather an eyesore, obstructing as it does, the view of the noble river; is the only means of traffic with the mainland, when the river being frozen over, navigation is impeded. The city is laid out very much like an old French town, but has of late been much improved; the streets are gradually being widened; and the city with its fine blocks of buildings, and its numerous public edifices, looks substantial, and shows the evidences of great accumulated wealth. The Quays are very fine; built entirely of solid limestone, and extending for several miles, undisfigured by unsightly warehouses, and stores, as is unfortunately so often the case. At a short distance from the city is the Mont Real, which gives to the city its name of Montreal, now used in place of the ancient Indian one Hochelaga. From the summit of this beautiful eminence, a magnificent panorama is presented of the city, with its noble quays, and glittering spires. From it can also be seen, the great St. Lawrence, as it winds its way, for miles, through a gently undulating plain, dotted with pretty little villages. This “mountain,” as it is locally called, is a general recreation ground for the people of Montreal; and round the base, and winding around the hill, are beautiful drives. St. James, and Notre Dame streets, are the principal promenades, and contain the best retail establishments. St. Paul street, fronting the quays, and extending their entire length, is the principal commercial thoroughfare; whilst other smaller streets, branching off these main arteries, contain large blocks of warehouses. The principal residences are in the suburbs, extending to the foot of the mountain.",

    "Description":"I left Montreal for Quebec, by the steamer City of Montreal, in the evening; and arrived at the latter city early the next morning. These river steamers are most commodious, and beautifully fitted up; and form, in the warm weather, a far more agreeable mode of travelling, than the dusty railway cars. The first appearance of Quebec from the river is very grand; here the banks rise precipitously, and are covered with fine trees, nestling amongst which are numerous private residences. The river widens considerably, and is commanded by the guns of the citadel, perched high up on the height; from which the ramparts extend round the city, rendering it so strong a fortress, that it has been called the “Gibraltar of America.” Since the regular troops who garrisoned it were recalled, and the charge of the fortress assumed by the Canadian Government; the ramparts are falling into decay, and the guns rusting. The British Government commenced the building of three powerful forts on Point Levi, opposite to Quebec, on the other side of the river; but left them in an incomplete state, and nothing has been done by the Canadian Government to finish them. It would consequently not be a difficult matter, for an enterprising enemy, to carry Quebec, as it stands, by a coup de main; and this fortress, formerly considered impregnable, in the hands of an enemy commanding the navigation of the St. Lawrence, would virtually place Canada at his feet...The streets of Quebec are very narrow, and steep; especially those connecting the Upper, with the Lower Town. A large portion of the Upper Town is taken up by the buildings of the great religious corporations of the dominant denomination; such as the Seminary, Laval University, the Ursulines, the Hôtel Dieu, and the ancient Jesuit College; which latter has more recently been used as a barracks. Over the remaining portion of Upper Town, not taken up by the fortifications, are crowded the quaint, mediæval streets, and houses; the latter built generally of stone, two storeys high, and roofed with a shining tin, which gives the city, when the sun shines on it, a very glittering appearance. The Lower Town is the oldest, and most important; here are clustered at the foot of the promontory, under the guns of the grand battery, 200 feet above, the principal wharves, ferry-landings, commercial houses, and banks.",

    "Description":"I now took the steamer up the River Ottawa, to visit the city of that name,—the political metropolis of the Dominion. This stream flows through thickly-wooded country, with extensive saw-mills on the banks, for the conversion of pine logs into planks, etc. Ottawa is situated on the river of that name, at its junction with the Rideau; the city being on a hill, between the two rivers, and divided into the Upper and Lower Town, by the Rideau Canal. It has a population of 25,000; is the centre of the lumber trade of the Ottawa and its tributaries; and otherwise possesses some extensive flour-mills, and manufactories of agricultural implements, mill machinery, &c. Facing it, on the opposite side of the river, are the suburbs of Hull, and New Edinburgh, connected with the city by several bridges. The great feature, however, of Ottawa, is that imposing pile, or rather piles of building,— forming as they do three sides of a quadrangle,—occupied as the Parliament Houses and Government Offices. These buildings are situated on a hill, descending abruptly to the river; are built in the Italian Gothic style; and, with their irregular towers, and pinnacles glittering in the sun, form as imposing a structure, as is to be seen in America. The south side of the quadrangle is formed by the Houses of Parliament; whilst the east and west sides, are taken up by the Departmental Offices. The two wings containing the latter, are quite detached from the front, forming the Parliament Houses; and there are thus three distinct blocks of building, which together form a pile, of which Canadians may justly be proud; and a fit abode, for the Legislature of the great colony. The interior of the Houses of Parliament is very fine; the Chambers for the two branches of the Legislature have beautiful stained glass windows, but are still very light. The Chamber of the Commons, to my mind, is far handsomer than its prototype at Westminster; but like it, its acoustic properties are bad. Facing the Speaker's chair is a fine statue of Her Majesty, and busts of the Prince and Princess of Wales; and the corridors contain portraits of former Speakers. The Parliament Library is a handsome structure, containing forty thousand volumes. The most important edifice in the city, after the Government buildings, is the Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame. This is a large stone building, with two spires covered with shining tin,—poor in style,—but having a very picturesque appearance, when seen from a distance. The scenery in the vicinity is very beautiful; consisting of well-timbered country, watered by several rivers, interspersed with numerous waterfalls. The principal of these are the Falls of the Chaudiére, and the Rideau; the former being especially beautiful.",

    "Description":"A delightful trip through these various beautiful scenes brought us to Fort Ticonderoga, a ruin standing on a high rocky eminence. This fort was built by the French in 1756, and was named by them Carillon; but this has been supplanted by its present Indian appellation of Ticonderoga, which signifies “noisy,” so called from the Falls in the vicinity. Though now a ruin, it has been the scene of many a fierce struggle in former times. In 1758, it was attacked by an English force of 16,000 men, under Abercrombie, who was however repulsed, with a loss of 2,000 men; but in the following year, it was abandoned by the French, and taken possession of by the British. Ticonderoga has been held successively by the French, the British, the French again, the American Colonists, and was finally reduced by General Burgoyne; when it remained in the hands of the British, until the termination of the revolutionary war, and was then ceded to the Americans. The scenery in the vicinity of this old fortress is very beautiful, and the drive of four miles along the sparkling stream, that connects Lake Champlain with Lake George, is delightful. This turbulent little stream, has a descent of 230 feet; in the course of which, there are two series of lovely cascades, called the Falls of Ticonderoga. The romantic beauty of these, is however, marred by the factories that have been erected along the banks, near the villages of Alexandria and Ticonderoga. The scenery however, varies continually; and openings in the foliage, reveal vistas of the lake, with the hills and valleys of Vermont in the background; whilst the little stream foams, and tumbles, beside us, presenting at every turn, new and beautiful combinations, of rock draped with rich verdure, the colours of which harmonize beautifully with the dark blue of the lake, glimpses of which we are continually obtaining.",

    "Description":"Saratoga contains a population of 9,000; but during the months of July and August, this number is increased by visitors to 30,000. The hotels are colossal; the principal being the Grand Union, the Congress Hall, and the United States, which are only open for four months out of the year, and will alone repay a visit to Saratoga. The Grand Union has over a mile in length of piazzas, two miles of halls, ten acres of carpets, and eight hundred bedrooms. These hotels are, in spite of their great size, very comfortable; and their proprietors cater for the amusement of their guests, during the season, by having good bands, and balls every night. They will each accommodate from a thousand to fifteen hundred guests. The arrivals at Saratoga, during the season, often amount to a thousand daily. And now a few words about the Springs, which are chalybeate or acidulous saline, according to the relative proportion of their particles; the constituent ones being carbonate of soda, chloride of sodium, carbonate of magnesia, hydriodate of soda, silica and alumina, carbonic acid gas, with occasional traces of iodine and potassa. The principal are Congress and Columbia Springs, both situated in a tastefully laid out little park, and over them elegant light structures have been erected; Excelsior Spring, situated in Excelsior Park; High Rock Spring, situated on the top of a rock, whence its name; the Hamilton and Hathorn Springs, in the centre of the town; the Washington, United States, and Empire Springs; Red Spring, so called from the colour of its waters when agitated; the Star, Eureka, and White Sulphur Springs. Putnam Spring is used for bathing purposes, being chalybeate. The most remarkable is the Geyser, or Spouting Spring, the waters of which spout up high in the air, through a shaft sunk 140 feet through the solid rock; and are very saline, and only fourteen degrees above zero. The Glacier Spring is another geyser, in close proximity to it. Life in Saratoga, in the great hotels, may be summed up in a few words. It is ephemeral, only lasting a couple of months; and during that period wealth, beauty, fashion, and other\ningredients not so desirable, meet and intermingle, in the whirl and excitement of the\nballroom at night; visits to the Springs in the morning; and promenades or drives, in the\nafternoon....",

It was founded by the Dutch in 1612, and named by them Williamstadt, until 1664, when it fell into the hands of the British, and was re-named by them Albany, in honour of the Duke of York and Albany, afterwards James II. The city has a population of 80,000, and is a place of great commercial importance, from its position on the Hudson, and its proximity to the great Erie and Champlain Canals; the former of which gives it the command of a fine water-way to the west; and the latter, facilities of cheap water carriage to the north. It is also the centre of a large railway system. Albany is situated on a high ridge, and with its numerous spires, presents a very imposing appearance, when seen from the opposite side of the river. Statestreet, its principal thoroughfare, ascends from the water's edge to the height, on which stand the Capitol, and principal public buildings. The present State House is a plain, unpretentious building; but the new Capitol now in course of erection, in close proximity to it, will be, when completed, the finest edifice in the whole country; with the exception alone of the Federal Capitol at Washington. The State Library is a fine building, containing 90,000 volumes; and amongst other historical relics and curiosities, the original Arnold and André Correspondence. The City Hall is a beautiful white marble structure, with a fine portico, supported upon six Ionic columns. Albany possesses several public libraries, museums, and establishments devoted to educational purposes; amongst the latter may be mentioned the Normal School, for the training of teachers. Its churches are numerous, and many of them are handsome structures.",

    "Description":"The City of New York, the commercial metropolis of the United States, and the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, is situated at the mouth of the Hudson, and occupies the whole extent of Manhattan Island; which is thirteen and a half miles long, by a width varying from a few hundred yards to two miles and a quarter. It also takes up a portion of the mainland, and three small islands in East River—viz., Randall's, Ward's, and Blackwell's. The area of New York is forty-one and a half square miles, of which twentyone and a half are on Manhattan Island, nineteen on the mainland, and about three quarters of a mile on the smaller islands. Its greatest length is sixteen miles, and its greatest width four and a half. It is separated from the City of Brooklyn by a branch of the Hudson called East River; and from its other leading dependency, Jersey City, by the Hudson proper. The older portion of the city is irregularly laid out; the larger and newer portion is more regular. The streets running the length of the island are called avenues, and are numbered from First upwards; the cross-thoroughfares bear the name of streets, and are numbered from First and go up to 225th. The buildings between two streets form a block, and twenty-one blocks, including the roadway, measure a mile. I was much struck with the English appearance of the city, and subsequently observed this to be a feature of all the great cities of the Eastern States; notably of Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.",

    "Description":"Brooklyn, though a distinct city with separate municipal officers, is generally regarded as a dependency of New York; many of the merchants having their counting-houses in the latter, and residing in the former. It covers an area of twenty square miles, and contains a population of half-a-million. It is often called the “City of Churches” on account of the great number of its religious edifices; and it otherwise possesses many fine public buildings. Prominent amongst the latter, are the City Hall, a marble edifice of the Ionic order; the Court House, another marble building of Corinthian architecture, with a fine portico anddome; the Academy of Design; and the Mercantile Library; the latter, a fine Gothic building, with reading-rooms, and 40,000 volumes. Prospect Park is a large, and fine recreation ground, covering 550 acres of ground. The view from here, of the cities of New York, and Brooklyn; of the harbour, with its shipping; and the rivers, with their islands; is very fine. It is beautifully laid out, somewhat after the style of Central Park; but is more densely timbered, and its large meadows, shut in by wooded hills, give it a distinct individuality.",

    "Description":"Boston, the capital of the Old Bay State as Massachusetts is sometimes called, and chief city of New England, is situated on Massachusetts Bay and comprises Boston proper, East Boston, South Boston, Roxbury, and Dorchester. The city proper covers a peninsula only 700 acres in extent, and is consequently very closely built upon. East Boston occupies Maverick's Island, and having the greatest depth of water, at its wharves lie all the ocean steamers, and vessels of large draught. Some of these wharves are of considerable extent, that belonging to the Cunard Company being over 1,000 feet long. South Boston extends for about two miles along the south side of the harbour, by an arm of which, it is separated from Boston proper. The city is connected with Charlestown, one of its suburbs, by the Charles river bridge 1,5000 feet long; and with Cambridge, another of its suburbs, by the West Boston bridge 2,750 feet in length. The harbour covers an area of about seventy-five square miles, and is studded with numerous islands, which give it a very picturesque appearance. It is memorable for having been the scene of the occurrence, that led to the battle on the neighbouring heights of Bunker Hill, the actual beginning of the Revolutionary War, the results of which have been perhaps more important, than those of any other historical event. This occurrence, as is well-known, was the destruction, by a party of Bostonians disguised as Indians, of the obnoxious tea, attempted by the Home Government of the,day to be forced upon the colonists. Boston is one of the oldest cities in the States, having been founded in 1625, a few years after the settlement of New York. In 1872, it was the scene of an immense conflagration, which caused great devastation, destroying about 800 of the best buildings, which have however in an incredibly short space of time, been replaced by other, and better edifices. It is very much like an English provincial city in appearance, and is without doubt the most old-fashioned town in the States; the streets being mostly narrow and crooked, especially in the older part. Washington and Tremont Streets are the principal business thoroughfares, and contain many fine shops, and other buildings. Since the fire the streets generally have been widened, and otherwise improved. Boston has often been called the “Athens of America,” from Harvard University, the most ancient seat of learning in the country, being in its immediate vicinity; and from its possessing many other institutions devoted to higher learning. The pride of its New England inhabitants is proverbial, and was exemplified after the great conflagration; when Chicago and other towns collected by voluntary contribution, and forwarded a sum of £40,000, for the use of the people rendered homeless; which the Bostonians refused to accept, on the plea that they were rich enough to support their own poor. The public buildings of Boston are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; the most prominent are the State House, and the City Hall. The former is a building in the Grecian style of architecture, with an imposing colonnade in front, and surmounted by a gilded dome. The entrance leads directly into the Rotunda, in which are a fine statue of Washington, busts of former-governors, and trophies of banners and cannon. The City Hall is an imposing building of white granite, in the Italian Renaissance style, with a fine louvre dome. On the lawn in front is a fine bronze statue of Franklin.",

    "Description":"After spending a few days in viewing the lions of Boston, I left by the New York and New Haven Railway for Hartford, which, until last year alternated with New Haven as the capital of Connecticut, but which has now been made the sole metropolis. It is one of the prettiest of the many pretty New England towns, lying in the valley of the Connecticut River, at the head of its navigation and junction with Park River; the country in the vicinity being rich, cultivated plains, interspersed with well-wooded hills, and dotted with villages and homesteads. The town itself is regularly laid out, some of the streets running parallel with the Connecticut river and being crossed by others at right angles; it is divided into two portions by Park river, which is spanned by numerous bridges. Main Street, the principal thoroughfare, presents for about a mile an unbroken front of shops, public buildings and churches. The city proper is connected with its suburb East Hartford, by a fine iron bridge over the Connecticut river 1,000 feet long. Hartford boasts a fine public park, covering forty six acres of ground, prettily situated on the banks of Park River; at the upper end of which, are the buildings of the Episcopal College of the Holy Trinity, the leading educational institution of the city, and one of the most important in the State. The course of instruction at Trinity College is similar to that at Yale; but more attention is paid to religious studies. There are about a hundred students in residence, and a staff of about twenty able professors. Divine Service is held twice daily, at which the attendance of the undergraduates is compulsory; and attached to the College is a fine Library of 7,000 volumes, where the mitre, which belonged to Bishop Seabury, is preserved as a relic,—such ornaments not being used in the American Episcopal Church. The College buildings are three in number, and are plain, substantial stone structures; but a new site for the College has been purchased, and it is intended to erect better and more suitable edifices.",

    "Description":"Leaving New Haven by the Stonington and Providence Railway, the road lies for some distance along the shores of Long Island Sound, through well-cultivated country; and after passing the important towns of New London, Stonington, and Westerly, we arrived at Providence, one of the capitals of Rhode Island, the smallest of all the States in the Union. This city is situated on an arm of Narrangansett Bay, called Providence River, and is, after Boston, the most populous and wealthy city in New England. It is a remarkably pretty place, the prettiest in fact of all the New England towns. The river flows into the centre of the city, where it expands into a fine lagoon, nearly a mile in circumference; and round this a park has been formed, planted with beautiful elms; in addition to which there are numerous greens or squares, and a pretty park of 100 acres, called after the founder of the city Roger Williams, by a descendant of whom it was presented to the citizens. The land upon which Providence is built, is somewhat hilly; and therefore unlike the flat monotony of New Haven, it presents a diversity of appearance, rendered picturesque by the hills being covered with fine residences. The principal business thoroughfare is Westminsterstreet, and from it extends the Arcade, one of the lions of the city, of which the people of Providence are very proud. This Arcade is 225 feet long and 80 feet wide, and has three stories containing shops; it is entered at either end through an imposing Doric portico. On the heights at one end of the town, are the six buildings of the Brown University, an old, and one of the best educational institutions in New England. These buildings stand in extensive grounds, and contain a large library and art collection. The public buildings of Providence are neither remarkable for their number, nor beauty; several now in course of erection, when completed, will materially add to the architecture of the city. In the centre of one of the squares, stands a very fine monument of granite, with five large bronze statues, erected to the memory of those Rhode Island soldiers and sailors, who fell in the Civil War. On this monument are inscribed the seventeen hundred and odd names of those it commemorates. Providence contains a population of over 100,000, and is the most important railway centre in New England, and the seat of many manufactures; the principal being cotton and woollen goods (it being the leading American market for “prints”), the Gorham-plate, the Peabody rifles, and the celebrated Corliss engines.",

    "Description":"Philadelphia, the old Quaker City of Brotherly Love, as its name implies, is the largest in the States, in point of area, and the second in population. It is situated between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, about six miles above their junction; at present contains about 350 miles of paved streets, and a greater number of houses than any other city in America. It is very regularly laid out, the streets all running north and south, or east and west; the former are numbered successively from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, commencing with First Street, and going up to Twenty-third, and as the city has outgrown its former limits, they are now continued on the other side of the Schuylkill and proceed for a great distance. The houses in the streets running east and west, which have mostly pomological names, as Chestnut Street, Walnut Street, Vine Street, Filbert Street, &c., are all numbered from east to west; all between First and Second Streets, being numbered from 100 to 200, and all between Second and Third Streets, from 200 to 300, and so on. This is a system that might advantageously be carried out in all new cities, as it enables a stranger to find his way about very easily. For instance, if the nearest house be 940 then the visitor knows he is between Ninth and Tenth Streets; and in like manner, as all the numbered streets running north and south are allowed a hundred numbers, for each block distant from Market Street, the centre of the city; a stranger has only to learn the cardinal points, and he can calculate to a nicety, his distance from the Delaware or Market Street. The streets however are not wide, and in spite of their regularity, Philadelphia cannot be called a fine city; especially as its public buildings are not so imposing as those of many less important places. Like Boston, it much resembles an English city, and the inhabitants generally have an old-country look. The great feature of Philadelphia is Fairmount Park, one of the largest in the world, covering a space of 2,740 acres, extending for seven miles on both sides of the Schuylkill River, and Wissahickon Creek. It is nearly fourteen miles in length, and possesses great natural beauty; though up to the present time, little has been done towards its improvement. Within the park are situated the reservoirs that supply the city with water, which latter is brought from the Schuylkill, and forced up to the reservoirs by hydraulic power. Fairmount also contains a colossal bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln, and a small Art gallery in which are a few very fine pictures. Adjoining, is the new Zoological garden, which has only recently been formed, but which already contains a good collection of animals. The grounds are well laid out, and the various houses for the animals are very elegant structures. There are some pretty squares in the city. Logan Square contains seven acres, nicely arranged; Washington Square is enclosed by a handsome iron railing, is very well kept, and contains a specimen of every kind of tree that will grow in this climate, whether indigenous or not. Franklin Square has a fine fountain in the centre, and has a very trim appearance. Rittenhouse Square is in the aristocratic portion of the city, and is surrounded by fine mansions. The principal streets are Chestnut Street, which contains the best retail establishments; Market Street, the principal business thoroughfare; and Broad Street, containing the principal private residences and churches. Other leading thoroughfares are Lombard, Arch, Race, Vine, and Third Streets.",

    "Description":"After having spent a couple of weeks in Philadelphia, I was soon conveyed by rail to Baltimore, the chief city of Maryland, and in population and commerce, one of the principal in the United States. The scenery on the route from Philadelphia to Baltimore is uninteresting, although numerous well-cultivated farms, and many thriving towns are passed. Amongst the latter may be enumerated Chester, the oldest town in Pennsylvania, it having been settled by some Swedes in 1643; Wilmington, the capital of the State of Delaware with a population of over 30,000, and the seat of many important industries; and Newark, a pretty little place, containing the well-known Delaware College. Shortly after leaving the latter place, the train crosses the celebrated Mason and Dixon's line, so long the boundary between the Northern and Southern States. At Havre de Grace we crossed the beautiful Susquehanna River, with its numerous pretty islands, on a bridge nearly a mile in length. This has been erected in place of the one destroyed by the Confederate soldiers in the late Civil War, for the purpose of cutting off the Federal communication with Washington. Baltimore is situated on the Patapsco River, about fourteen miles from the entrance to Chesapeake Bay; its harbour is very capacious, and consists of an inner and outer basin, protected by Fort McHenry. The city is very much like a large English provincial town in appearance, and cannot by any means be called pretty; the streets being narrow, and closely built upon; but it is one of the cleanest towns in America. The inhabitants, who pride themselves upon being the handsomest people in the States, are quiet and orderly; and the town generally has a more homely appearance than is usually the case with American cities. Altogether I would as soon live in Baltimore, as in any town in the United States. Baltimore is sometimes called the “Monumental City;” why,—it is difficult to imagine; because it only possesses three Monuments, which are however very fine. The Washington Memorial is a Doric shaft 176 feet in height, resting on a huge pedestal, and supporting a colossal statue of Washington; it forms a very imposing landmark. Battle Monument, erected to the memory of those, who fell in defending the city in 1814, when attacked by the British, is also a fine column in the form of a Roman Fasces, surmounted by a female figure representing Baltimore, the base being in the form of an Egyptian temple. There is also a fine statue erected in honor of Thomas Wildey, the founder in the States of the order of Odd Fellows. The principal edifice in the city is the new City Hall, one of the finest municipal buildings in the country. It is built entirely of white marble, in the composite style, surmounted by an immense dome; but it stands in a narrow street, where its fine proportions are not seen to advantage. The Exchange is a fine building, having on its two façades colonnades of six Ionic columns, the shafts of which are single blocks of marble of admirable workmanship. It is crowned by a large cupola, beautifully frescoed in the interior, and contains a fine reading-room. In this building are the Post Office, the Custom House and the Merchants' Bank. The Baltimore Athenæum is a fine institution, with a library of 26,000 volumes. The Peabody Institute is a fine white marble building erected by the late George Peabody the well-known philanthropist; it contains a free library of 56,000 books, and in connection with it, is an Academy of Arts.",

The view of Baltimore from the river is very picturesque, and the trip down the Bay is most pleasant. Whilst at Annapolis, I visited the Senate Chamber in the State House, memorable for being the room, in which Washington resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief of the forces, into the hands of Congress; after the objects of the Revolution had been attained. It contains a fine painting commemorating this scene; and Washington's address, and the reply of Congress, are also to be seen. The principal Naval College of the United States is at Annapolis; the buildings, situated in extensive grounds, seem to be excellently well adapted for the purpose, and the internal arrangements are said to be very good. In addition to an ordinary wooden training-ship, there is an iron Monitor in connection with the College; so that the cadets are practically trained in the management of that class of war vessel.",

    "Description":"Returning to Baltimore, I took train for Washington, the political metropolis of the Republic. Washington is situated on the north bank of the Potomac River, within an area of ten square miles, reserved for the Capital, in the District of Columbia. This Federal District of Columbia contains about sixty square miles,—its chief cities being Washington, the capital of the Union, and Georgetown. The object of making a Federal district, in which to place the capital of the country, was, to prevent any one State from exercising undue influence, by having the metropolis within its jurisdiction. The old law-makers of the Republic, in its early days, seem to have regarded this point as very essential to the common weal; and jealously watched that no one State gained an ascendancy over the others, in the Councils of the country. They had also in view the dangers of centralization, and in every case, second-rate towns were made the political capitals of the different States; so that, at the present time, it is seldom the capital of the State is at the same time its chief city. It is a singular anomaly, that Washington, the centre as it were of a purely democratic republic, has neither part nor lot in the authority to which it is subject. It sends no member to Congress, being in this respect less favourably situated than the Territories, which do return delegates to speak, if not to vote. The District of Columbia, in short, has taxation without representation. The city of Washington, originally designed by A. Ellicott, during the presidency of Washington, who by the way wished it to be called “The Federal City,” was laid out on a very grand scale, as it was anticipated that it would become an immense metropolis. This has, however, not proved the case, as the city has no commercial importance: it has consequently a ridiculously straggling appearance, and in it, palaces alternate with buildings that may comparatively be termed shanties. It is built on the rectangular parallelogrammic plan so common in America. The streets are all wide, and shaded by fine trees, and are divided into numbered streets, lettered streets, and avenues: thus, First, Second, and Third streets are crossed at right angles by A, B, and C streets; whilst the avenues, named after the different States of the Union, form the main arteries of the city. The principal of these is Pennsylvania Avenue, especially that portion which extends from the White House to the Capitol, and in it are situated most of the public buildings; whilst the best retail establishments are in Seventh street. The city contains a population of about 110,000 inhabitants; but this number is much increased during the sessions of Congress, when it swarms with political agents, needy office-seekers, and general hangers-on. The great feature however, of Washington, is its public buildings, foremost among which, stands the grand Capitol, one of the largest, and of its kind perhaps the finest edifice in the world. It crowns the summit of Capitol Hill, and consists of a main or central building, 352 feet long, and 121 feet deep, and two wings each 238 feet by 140 feet, covering together 3½ acres of ground. It may be said to be three distinct Grecian temples, each having a rich Corinthian portico, the centre one being surmounted by an immense dome, which altogether dwarfs its noble proportions, and which though painted to resemble marble, is constructed of iron. The central building is constructed of light yellow freestone painted white; the two extensions are of pure white marble, and the general appearance is severely classic, although it has a great fault, inasmuch as it fronts up hill, and its principal façade is turned away from the City. It stands within some thirty acres of grounds, beautifully laid out, and adorned with statuary; and in front of the building stands Greenough's colossal statue of Washington.",

    "YearOfTravel":1877,
    "Description":"Cincinnati, founded in 1788, and consequently a little under a century old, is certainly the most picturesque of the great cities of America; it is situated on the Ohio River, at this point about twice as broad as the Thames at Hungerford Bridge; its waters, yellow as those of the Tiber, here separating the State of Ohio from the adjoining one of Kentucky. On the Kentucky side of the river opposite Cincinnati, and connected with it by a magnificent iron suspension bridge 2,250 feet in length, the span between the towers being over 1,000 feet, are the cities of Covington and Newport. The view from the surrounding hills, of the three cities and the winding river, is very fine. Cincinnati is built on two terraces, rising one above the other, at a good elevation above the river; and being entirely surrounded by hills on three sides, thus lies in an amphitheatre; and this position gives it a picturesque variety of scenery, the want of which is so apparent in the majority of the large American cities. It is regularly laid out, the streets being broad, well paved, and crossing one another at right angles; although they are not as clean as they might be. This, by the way, is a failing common to all the cities of the Western States. The business portion of Cincinnati is compactly built, the buildings being for the most part of a dark freestone, which gives them a substantial appearance; the private residences are situated on the upper terrace, and on the hills in rear of the city. Fourth street is the fashionable promenade, and contains the finest shops. In Pearl street are the principal wholesale warehouses; and these being generally uniform high stone buildings, have a very imposing appearance. Third street contains the banks and insurance offices. There are, besides, many fine streets with beautiful private residences. A prominent feature in the city, is the beautiful Tyler-Davidson Fountain, erected at a cost, it is said, of £440,000, by Mr. Davidson, and by him presented to the citizens. It is of bronze, of exquisite workmanship; but it was cast in Munich, and though creditable alike in design and execution, it certainly cannot be regarded as a specimen of American art. The population of Cincinnati now approaches a quarter of a million of inhabitants, a third of which are either German or of German parentage, and occupy a portion of the city north of the Miami Canal, or the Rhine as they have re-named it. Crossing this canal, one finds oneself in seemingly quite a different country; no other language but German being heard, and the general appearance of the houses, and more especially of the numerous beer gardens, reminding one forcibly of the Fatherland. The Government buildings do not call for special mention; the County Court House being the only one with any pretensions to architectural design, but there are several very excellent charitable institutions, amongst which the Cincinnati Hospital and the Longview Asylum for the Insane are prominent. The city too is particularly well provided with firstclass educational establishments, many of them of a very high order. The principal church edifice in the city, is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Peter, a fine building in pure Grecian style with a high spire, and a portico supported upon ten columns.",

    "Description":"From Cincinnati I proceeded down the Ohio to Louisville. The view from the steamer on starting was very fine; on the one side the city rose, terrace above terrace, towards the hill-tops, which, covered with villa residences, and vineyards, formed a beautiful semi-circular background; whilst on the other side lay the twin cities of Covington and Newport, nestling at the foot of the Kentucky Hills. The river scenery is uninteresting; towns being at great distances apart, and separated by large tracts of virgin woodland, or plains, which have a great sameness, and tend to make the trip monotonous. The land on the upper Ohio, above Cincinnati, is said to be under cultivation, and to be of a more diversified character, with pretty homely scenery. Below Cincinnati, the river, which had hitherto formed the boundary between the States of Ohio, and Kentucky, makes a sudden bend, and becomes the dividing line between the States of Indiana and Kentucky. Lawrenceburg and Aurora passed by the steamer are flourishing little towns in Indiana, and have a rather considerable shipping trade. Big-Bone Lick on the Kentucky side, is so called from a quantity of mastodon bones having here been found. Carrollton stands at the junction with the Ohio of the Kentucky river, which is navigable for about 200 miles, and possesses very picturesque scenery. Madison one of the principal cities in Indiana presents a very imposing appearance from the river; it is well built and is a place of importance, having a large commerce. Approaching Louisville the view becomes very fine; the river, here about a mile wide, is crossed by an immense bridge, which connects the Northern and Southern railway systems; whilst the view of Louisville on the one side, and of Jeffersonville on the other, is really imposing. Louisville, the chief city of Kentucky, is situated on a plain surrounded by hills, on the Ohio, near the junction with that river of the Bear-Grass creek. Opposite the city are the falls of the Ohio, which are very picturesque, being a succession of small cataracts, extending right across the river, but which disappear when the water is high. To prevent the navigation of the Ohio from being impeded when its waters are low a canal has been constructed round the falls, at great cost, to a place called Shippingport. The city covers an area of thirteen square miles, with a frontage to the river of three miles, and is laid out with great regularity; the streets being straight, wide, well-paved, and shaded by fine trees, but like those of Cincinnati they might with advantage be kept cleaner.",

Its position is unrivalled; situated on a river, that, with its tributaries commands half the traffic of the whole country; in close proximity to enormous tracts of the best agricultural land, and to almost boundless forests of fine timber; with inexhaustible resources in its coal and iron deposits; there would appear to be no limit to the future greatness of this city. Its progress hitherto has been so rapid, equalled only by that of its great rival Chicago, that it seems destined in time to become, the greatest of American cities....St. Louis is built on three terraces, rising one above the other from the water's edge, and is, in spite of its smoke, and dust, one of the finest cities in America. It extends along the river for a distance of eleven miles, and covers an area of 21 square miles; the business portion being densely built, and the whole river-front embanked, and forming a Levee, as wharves are called in America. Built for the most part of stone, the city has a very substantial appearance, and is laid out with great regularity, the streets near the river running parallel with it and further back, being at right angles to those that cross them.The streets running north and south, or parallel with the river, are numbered First, Second, Third, etc.; those extending from east to west have mostly pomological names; and the houses, being all numbered on the Philadelphia plan, it is easy to calculate one's distance from Market street, the centre of the city, or from the Levee. Front street extending the whole length of the Levee, contains fine blocks of warehouses, and together with First and Second streets, is the centre of the wholesale trade of the city. Fourth street is the principal promenade, and in it are the finest shops; whilst the private residences are in the avenues, and in Pine, Olive, and Locust streets.",

As the steamer approached the desolate embankment, which seemed the only barrier between the low land on which the town is built and the waters of the great river rising above it, it certainly was difficult to imagine that sane men, even though they be speculators, could have fixed upon such a spot, on which to place the site of a city—an emporium of trade and commerce. The town itself is a collection of brick houses and wooden shanties, and the streets are rendered almost impassable by mud. A more desolate-looking place cannot be conceived. Surely Dickens must have had Cairo in mind, when he described the flourishing town of Eden.",

    "Description":"The next day we reached Memphis, in the State of Tennessee, 420 miles below St. Louis. This flourishing new city stands on a yellow bluff, thirty feet above the highest floods, and is already a place of much importance. It extends for several miles along the high banks of the river, though it does not run far back. The streets are at right angles to the principal thoroughfares, which are parallel to the river. In the centre of the town is a green square planted with trees, which seems a place of great resort by the citizens. The lofty stores and warehouses, the rows of shops on the broad street along the river, and the number and size of the public and private edifices, attest the results of the development of commerce created in a great measure by the Mississippi. Memphis is the outlet of a large cotton district, and exports 400,000 bales annually. It has fine public buildings and hotels, a theatre, eighteen churches, two medical colleges, five daily and three weekly newspapers, besides numerous banks and insurance offices. It is connected by railway with New Orleans, Charleston, Louisville, and Little Rock; and possesses foundries and manufactories of boilers and machinery. Its population is estimated at something over 30,000. During the War of Secession it fell into the hands of the Federal forces after the fall of Island No. 10, in 1862, and was the base of military operations for the capture of Vicksburg. Memphis is a wonderful place, and impressed me with the idea of progress more than any other place in the States. I was perplexed and amused by the mixture of whites, negroes, and of the semi savage, degraded by his contact with the white man; by the contrast between the gigantic steamer and the “dug-out” of the black man, which are to be seen in close proximity on the river; by the roll of heavily-laden drays and the rattle of cars in the streets, and at all the phenomena of active commercial life, being included in the same scope of vision that takes in, at the other side of the Mississippi, lands scarcely yet settled, and some that remain in the same state as they were centuries ago.",

    "Description":"The next day we reached Vicksburg, which is about 400 miles distant from New Orleans and 120 from Natchez, and which stands on a high bluff of yellow clay on the left bank of the river. Seen from the river with the remains of its great earth-works, and with the Court House and the spire of the Roman Catholic Church on the highest points, Vicksburg has a somewhat imposing and even picturesque appearance. Vicksburg is the largest town, though not the capital of the State of Mississippi, and its exports of cotton before the war amounted to 100,000 bales per annum. It was strongly fortified in 1862 and provided with a numerous garrison. In January 1863 it was attacked by the Federal naval force from Memphis and New Orleans, but without success. In April 1863 a naval attack was combined with the land forces under General Grant, who defeated General Pemberton near Jackson, cut off supplies and reinforcements for the garrison, and with a close siege and continual assaults compelled a surrender on July 4th 1863, with 30,000 prisoners, 200 cannon, and 70,000 stand of arms. From the natural strength and importance of its position Vicksburg has often been called the “Quebec of the Mississippi,” but the town itself is miserable, the streets for the most part being unpaved, and the buildings irregular, and generally constructed of wood or brick. From the terrace of the Court House, the view of the river, and of the vast tracts of forest, extending as far as the eye can reach, is, however, very fine. A little above the town, situated on a hill that slopes gently down to the river, is a cemetery in which repose the bodies of more than 30,000 Federal soldiers, an awful memorial of that terrible fratricidal war, called by some Americans “a little family quarrel.” Vicksburg is a place of much commercial importance and contains about 10,000 inhabitants.",

    "Description":"New Orleans the political and commercial metropolis of the State of Louisiana, is situated on both sides of the Mississippi, but principally on the left, about 100 miles above its mouth. Though large, it is anything but a fine city, being built on the alluvial banks of the river, on ground lower than the high-water level, and only protected from inundations by a levee or embankment of earth, four feet high and fifteen feet wide, that extends for a great distance on both sides of the river, and forms a pleasant promenade in the winter months. The water that percolates through this embankment and the natural drainage is conducted by open gutters, which run through the streets, into a swamp that lies between the city and Lake Pontchartrain, three miles distant. There is always the danger of the Mississippi making a breach in the embankment and pouring its waters into the city; besides which, Lake Pontchartrain has a nasty habit of backing up and inundating it, after the prevalence of certain winds. Thus New Orleans is unpleasantly situated between two waters; and the soil is so full of moisture that no excavations can be made. The largest buildings have no cellars below the surface; and in the cemeteries there are no graves, the dead being placed in tombs above ground. The older part of New Orleans is built within a great bend of the river, from which circumstance it derives its name of the “Crescent City.” It has however long ago overstepped its original limits, and now extends for a distance of about twelve miles along the river bank, presenting an outline somewhat like the letter S....The streets of New Orleans are very wide and handsome in appearance, though only the principal of them are paved. Those parallel with the river extend in an unbroken line, for a distance of about twelve miles; those at right angles to them, that run from the river to the lake, are also very regular. The streets that are not paved, are simply quagmires: in winter they are not practicable at all, and even in summer the dust makes them almost impassable. The open gutters form a bad feature of the streets of New Orleans; these have very steep sides, and are crossed at street comers by small bridges, consisting of single stones, and allowing two persons only to cross at a time.",

The only building in Mobile that calls for special mention is the Custom House, which also contains the Post Office; this is a handsome edifice built of granite. The City now contains a population of 40,000 and its principal business consists in the shipment of cotton, of which staple 350,000 bales are annually exported.

The private residences have mostly beautiful gardens, which are in constant bloom, and the city itself is laid out very regularly, the streets being wide, well-shaded, and crossing one another at right angles. A charming feature of Savannah too is the number of squares or greens at the intersection of the principal streets. These squares, twentyfour in number, vary in extent from two to three acres, and being situated equi-distant from one another, laid out in walks, and planted with evergreens and ornamental trees, assist materially in giving to the city, that appearance of tropical luxuriance of vegetation, that constitutes its great beauty. The position of Savannah, from a commercial point of view is very good. It is situated on the Savannah River, about eighteen miles above the point where it empties itself into the Atlantic; and it has become the second port in the States for the shipment of cotton. Its river-front is in the form of a crescent, extending a distance of about three miles, and all the large warehouses are here built on a narrow strip of land, that intervenes between the wharves on the river-front and the base of a steep bluff; thus their uppermost windows in the rear overlook a sandy plain on the top of this bluff, planted with rows of trees, which, under the name of “the Bay,” is the great commercial mart of the city.",

    "Description":"Charleston is situated on a narrow spit of land formed by the junction of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, at the point where they enter the sea; it thus possesses three water frontages. It is now the principal city in South Carolina in size and commercial importance, and contains over 50,000 inhabitants. It is, for America, an old city, having been settled by an English colony in 1679. It played an important part in the Revolution, which obtained for the States their independence, and also in the first stages of Southern secession, the cause of the late civil war. The Harbour is an estuary about seven miles in length, extending to the Atlantic; it is almost land-locked, the entrance being only a mile in width. It is protected by strong batteries, the principal of which are Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, and Castle Pinckey; the former being situated on Sullivan's Island, at the entrance to the harbour on the right. Fort Sumter is now in ruins, and forms a picturesque feature of the harbour view; it is built on a shoal on the left side of the entrance, and commands the channel by which vessels enter. Castle Pinckey, covering the crest of a mud bank, is immediately in front of the town, being distant from it about a mile, and directly facing the entrance. It was here that open hostilities first commenced in the late war, when Fort Sumter was bombarded by the Confederates, who compelled the Federal garrison to surrender; and for a long time afterwards these fortifications were one of the chief points of Federal attack, Charleston is built on low flat land; extends a distance of three miles from north to south, and is laid out with some degree of regularity. There is no uniformity in the buildings, but the absence of regularity in this respect is more than compensated for, by the greater diversity; and as the houses are mostly detached, quaint in appearance, and surrounded by gardens containing the grand oaks, magnolias, and that luxuriant vegetation peculiar to the South; the town has a most picturesque appearance. Charleston suffered very much during the civil war, but since then, such progress has been made in the work of rebuilding, that it now shows but few traces of the great damage it sustained. King street is the principal thoroughfare and contains the best shops. In Meeting street are the warehouses in which the wholesale trade of the city is conducted, and the Banks and Insurance Offices are located in Broad street. The prettiest feature of Charleston, is a fine promenade called the Battery, situated at the water's edge, and surrounded by the best private residences. From it a magnificent view of the harbour is obtained. The country to the north of the city is very beautiful, and the drives in that direction along the banks of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers are most enjoyable, passing as they do, through rich tropical shrubbery.",

    "Description":"Richmond the chief city and political metropolis of Virginia, and during the civil war the capital of the Southern Confederacy, is situated on the James River, about 100 miles by water from Chesapeake Bay. During the war, great importance was attached to its possession by both the Federals and Confederates, and the former often attempted its reduction. The obstinacy however, with which it was defended, may be seen in the remains of the strong line of earthworks thrown up around it, and it was only surrendered after General Lee evacuated Petersburg in 1865. To prevent the tobacco warehouses and public stores from falling into the hands of the Federals, they, together with the bridges over the James River, were destroyed by fire. In this manner a considerable portion of the city was burned; but directly after the cessation of hostilities, the work of rebuilding commenced, and Richmond now presents but few tokens of the conflagration, and is rapidly regaining its former prosperity. The city, which is laid out with great regularity, is built on two eminences called Richmond Hill and Shocktoe Hill, separated by the Shocktoe Creek. Crowning the summit of the latter of these hills, and standing within a small park of some eight acres, is the State Capitol, a fine edifice with a portico supported on Ionic columns, the design for which is said to have been furnished by Thomas Jefferson, after that of the Maison Carrée , at Nismes, in France. Within this building is a life-size marble statue of Washington, erected by the Legislative Assembly of Virginia. Richmond contains some good public buildings, the best and most prominent being the City Hall, and the Custom House and Post Office, both of which are handsome structures. There are also several buildings, to which much interest attaches, from having been prominently connected with the late Civil War. Such are the Brockenbrough House, formerly the residence of Jefferson Davis when President of the Southern Confederacy, and the Libby and Castle Thunder Prisons, in which so many Northern prisoners languished in confinement.",

The next morning, which was again fine and warm, we started early on a voyage of discovery through the city, and, it being too early to find the Parliament Houses open, proceeded by train as far as the entrance to the grounds of Rideau Hall: a very small, unpretentious, and plainly-built house, with no good reception rooms, and altogether, we thought, quite unworthy to be the chief residence of the representative of the Queen in Canada. It is surrounded by a small, and not particularly ornamental garden, and woods containing no fine timber. There are pretty vistas, and a skating-pond and toboggan-slide—gay sights, we were told, in the winter; the house was being repaired, in the absence of its occupier at Winnipeg, and seemed in somewhat dilapidated condition. Each succeeding governor brings his own decorations—tapestry, pictures, etc., and carries them away with him at the termination of his appointment. After seeing the rather pretty Rideau falls, we trammed back to the city, and saw, the Chaudiere falls and lumber department; went over the exteriorly-fine and imposing Gothic Parliament Houses, built of a beautiful cream coloured sandstone, diversified with deep red—the whole presenting a rich effect of colour, enhanced by the beautiful green lawns in the midst of which it stands. A fine library adjoins, containing 20,000 volumes.",

However, we managed to get a carriage, which took us to Victoria Park, and one of the great lumber yards, crammed with huge stacks of fresh smelling planks cut to various sizes, the produce of the great forests of Ontario, with a charming foreground of broad river and sand, beyond which, fringed with masses of tall trees of brilliant gold, towered the enormous and picturesque pile of municipal and parliamentary buildings, and the magnificent University of Toronto, with its superb central tower and many turrets, and Observatory, School of Science, Library, etc.; all of which we visited and greatly admired, as well as the too short time we had to spare allowed. The whole city is exceedingly well built of very handsome material; and its society, in refinement and cultivation of literature and science, is said to equal, if not surpass, its American rival, Boston called by some the Florence, by others the Athens, of the New World.",

We were sorry to hear that English travellers mostly go to the hotels on the American side, across the river—unpatriotic of them and unwise; for the Canadian is by far the more impressive side to stay on. The American Prospect Park side is within a few minutes' walk of scenes beautiful and magnificent beyond description: you are close to the American rapids above the American Fall, and not very far from the Canadian rapids. But from the Canadian side you have before you, full in face, the entire panorama of all the falls, the Horseshoe, the Central, and the American. And you are within only five minutes' walk of the Great Iron Bridge, suspended at a giddy height above the boiling, seething, whirling waters below the American Fall, crossing over them to the American side, and along which, filled with awe and a sensation of terror, drenched with the spray, and deafened with the roar, you creep or drive nervously across—to find yourself at once in Prospect Park.",

Now, the towering buildings “scrape the sky”—some very handsome, and all imposing, from their bulk and extent, and the solid, massive granite of which they are built. The parks, especially Lincoln Park, are of vast extent and beautifully kept; long rows of brilliant flowerbeds, conservatories, fountains, statues, and monuments, particularly the magnificently placed, superbly colossal, monumental building in memory of Abraham Lincoln. It was too far to go to the site of the “World's Fair” of the previous year, nor would it have been worth while, most of the great exhibition buildings having been pulled down; nor did I care to see the Union Stockyards, which live pigs enter at one end as pigs, and come out in five minutes at the other as sausages. So I wandered contentedly over the gardens and parks, all admirably wellkept, and after seeing the City Hall, and some of the principal buildings and residences, returned to the “Auditorium,” which has a great theatre attached to it, for supper, before starting Westward ho!",

The “Queen City of the Plains” is one of the most wonderful examples of American growth and “push.” No thirty years ago it consisted merely of a small and straggling mining camp; now it is a wide-spreading and magnificent city, with grand public buildings, including a superb court-house seated on the high “Capitol” hill; long streets of immense width, delightfully shaded with cotton-wood and pepper trees, every street to the west ending in exquisite vistas of the blue Rockies; theatres, opera-house, numerous costly churches, a “city park ” of immense extent, containing lakes, conservatories, and a zoological garden—in short, a miracle of enterprise and rapid growth!

A hutlike little inn stands here; now, unluckily, closed for the winter, and a small meteorological station, generally lived in all the year round. The whole panorama indescribably grand. The fantastic foreground of vivid crimson rocks; the glittering snowfields shining and sparkling in the radiant sunshine, shadowed here and there, in their depths, by fugitive sunlit vapoury mists of the heavenliest blue, deepening to purple; range upon range of vast mountain chains of loveliest form; and, towering high above all, the wild serrated ridge of the exquisite, for ever ice-bound Sangre de Cristo, in the dimmest distance, stretching from far north to south, one long, unending, windblown, uptossed sea wave as it were, frozen for ever to icy stone! To the west, great, desolate, up-heaved, violent red and yellow rock-masses, the lower rich wooded hills entirely hidden; whilst, deep down below, one vast, sunny plain of waving golden prairie stretches far as eye can reach, into vaguest, far-off, mysterious, misty light.",

Every house, except in the more commercial streets, stands detached, surrounded by a well-dressed garden full of bright, sweet-scented flowers and fruit trees, whilst many of the larger residences dominate over quite a little park of their own, full of choice shrubs and trees intermixed with gorgeous flower beds. The Temple is surrounded by gardens beautifully laid out from the designs of Brigham Young, who although originally a bricklayer by trade, and illiterate, seems to have had much sense of artistic beauty. We next went to the Tabernacle, guided by a venerable and benevolent-looking Elder, with a long snow-white beard, who lost no opportunity of zealously crying up the excellence of his faith, which, he said, he was convinced, if duly expounded unto us and explained, we should inevitably embrace. This huge and ungainly building of elliptic form, entered by twenty doors, supports, on forty-four massive sandstone pillars a huge wooden roof shaped in imitation of the shell of a turtle, and seats comfortably 9,000 persons, several additional thousands finding standing room on important occasions. At one end of the ellipse a huge orchestral platform accommodates the ecclesiastical authorities, elders, and singers; opposed, at the other end, by an equally huge and very magnificent organ, built in the city. The whole of the flat central floor is covered with seats, and raised galleries of seats encircle the sides. Concerts are sometimes held here, the Mormons having had the privilege of listening on one occasion to the enchanting singing of Adelina Patti and other celebrities.",

By cable car, up and down almost, perpendicular streets, all bordered by lovely palms, eucalyptus, and locust trees; every house with its wide veranda covered with fragrant creepers in bloom, all basking in the golden sunshine; to the exquisitely-kept Golden-gate Park with its grand conservatories and lovely views, covering an area of more than 1,000 acres, admirably laid out with greenest turf and planted with every description of rare and beautiful shrub and tree and gorgeous flower beds. As soon as we could tear ourselves from the loveliness and innumerable walks and points of interest in the Park, we went on by the Ocean-beach Railway, to the magnificent Sutro Heights, crowned with enchanting gardens and shrubberies, overhanging the wide ocean, with its glorious lines of huge breaking waves thundering against the “Seal rocks” and beetling cliffs far below. A handsome villa stands high in the grounds, wreathed with brilliant flowers and creepers. The garden is simply an Eden! every imaginable delicate and lovely fern, bamboo and palm, flowers of every hue and fragrance, flowering and sweet-scented shrubs, mandarin and lemon trees with their charming pale-green foliage—over it all the deep blue sky and vivid golden sunshine. No plague of flies, but bright-winged butterflies and “murmur of innumerable bees” and fairy humming-birds. Verily an earthly paradise!",

The first sight of them, for the giants we had seen in the forest as we came along were mere pigmies compared with these, simply takes your breath away! It feels like an incredible dream! and this variety of the “Sequoia” ( Sequoia sempervirens ) is as beautiful as it is indescribably grand. The foliage is a glossy dark green, very like that of the yew in colour and form; the bark is a beautiful rich deep red, as also is the wood, and each tree consists of one magnificent huge central trunk, with immense and most picturesque red gnarled roots, out of which spring, all round the parent tree, ten or twelve younger smaller trees; that is, smaller as far as diameter of trunk goes, but in height these graceful and numerous off-shoots, as it were, from the roots, soar up into the sky two or three hundred feet, nearly as high as the central parent giant, which varies in diameter from fifteen to thirty feet. No words can express the beauty, the magnificent grandeur, of this glorious grove! Every single tree in it is a giant, and a giant with its attendant family of young giants, each separate tree consisting of a group of from twelve to fifteen. One of the central parent trees that we measured had a circumference of seventy feet, and others are still larger. Hours and hours one could spend, wandering from tree to tree, or rather, from tree-group to tree-group, through endless groves! Nothing more beautiful or more wonderful could be imagined!",

Immediately, and perpendicularly beneath you, deep down 5,000 feet below, hemmed in on all sides by stupendous vertical walls of frowning white granite crags, lies softly nestling an enchanted valley, narrow and long, shut in, in the opposite blue distance, by the misty, snow-clad “Cloud's rest;” shining fields of snow carrying the eye into the far-away, dim mystery of the horizon. In the heart of the valley, in deep sunshiny meadows, curving and winding like a serpent of silver, flows the shining Merced river; the bases of the snowy cliffs fringed with dark, solemn pines and feathery poplars of brilliant gold. Down to this haven of sunny rest the track is dangerous, and the whole steep, winding way overhangs fearful precipices; but fear is hushed in the absorption of the wondrous and ever-increasing beauty. At last the vale is reached, and looking upward you realize the tremendous and dizzy height of these vertical granite walls, dazzlingly white and smooth in parts, and rough and rugged in others. Here and there huge, detached masses, like Titans turned to stone; “cathedral spires” piercing to the skies; the entire valley one lovely, happy garden, cradled in crags. Groves of dark titanic pines, and the tender grace of delicate shrubs, and graceful trees softly waving their lovely foliage of every imaginable tint of green-gold, scarlet and pink, relieving and illuminating with a triumphant glory of dazzling colour the sternness of the unbending craggy heights; the whole exquisite scene steeped and bathed in the golden haze of the glowing, radiant noontide. Soon we pass the misty Bridal Veil, shedding its exquisite rainbowy fountains vaguely into the “happy valley,” transparent mists of loveliest blue rising to shadow and veil the gaunt protecting walls.",

    "Description":"Fresno, the head centre of the great vineyard section of California, is a well-built and very flourishing little city, with broad, tree-shaded streets, and a pretty park, in which stands a very grand city hall. I spent the time most agreeably in visiting several of the celebrated vineyards in the neighbourhood, in which are raised vast quantities of grapes dried as raisins for exportation; and walking about in the park and gardens, till alarming sounds of cannonading and firing of musketry terrified me into making the best of my way, through excited crowds, back to the comfortable little inn at tho depot, where I was informed that the row was not dangerous, but only in honour of the municipal elections which were to take place next day. Fresno is the“dinner depot,” with an excellent and very large restaurant, to which the principal inhabitants of the city seem “ abonnés ” for their meals. Every table simply groaned under the weight of grapes—huge, enormous bunches, perfectly delicious in flavour, unlike some varieties of Californian grapes. The object being to advertise the vine-growing capacity of the country, every passenger was pressed to eat as many grapes as possible, gratis; and when I left I was presented with a huge basket, almost too heavy to carry, full of this delicious fruit. This country is admirably irrigated, with water conveyed in canals from the inexhaustible supply in the mountains. I went on by the 6 p.m. train, so fearfully crowded that I was compelled to take refuge in my pet abhorrence, the “sleeper,” and at 7.30 next morning arrived at Los Angeles, through exquisite groves of oranges and lemons, peaches and mulberries—great quantities of the latter for the purposes of silkworm culture, which is now one of the most lucrative industries of California.",

    "Description":"It was a lovely cloudless morning, the “Sabbath morning,” and we at once betook ourselves to the “casa Robinson,” to make something more of a “Sunday toilette,” and to breakfast. The “casa” is a large and airy whitewashed house, with, as in all Mexican dwellings, a central “patio” (court), planted with oleanders and orange trees, into which the various rooms open. Of course, after the wonderful hotels of the United States, the Mexican “fondas,” like those of Spain, fall short; but the rooms all shone with clean fresh whitewash, and an entire absence of disagreeable insect like; the wooden floors were perfectly well scrubbed; here and there rocked a chair, and the food was quite clean and eatable—the bread and chocolate, as in Spain, superlatively good. After breakfast we walked through very clean streets of whitewashed flat-roofed houses, shaded by rows of poplars, to the cathedral, for the high mass, where we saw a most picturesque crowd, the same sort of gaily-dressed men with their “rebosos” (toga-like mantles) and pretty children and women, gracefully dressed in shawls or mantillas, that you see in Spain; the same absence of seats of any kind, the same scrupulous and perfect cleanliness, the same antique-sounding, cracked organs, and short Spanish sermon. The cathedral itself is spacious and picturesque; it was built during the Spanish occupation, at the beginning of the last century, at a cost of 800,000 dollars raised by a tax on the neighbouring Santa Eulalia silver mines. After mass, we wandered in the lovely sunshine, through the prettily-situated city, with its fine park and gardens, full of oranges and myrtles, roses and palms, bordered with fine eucalyptus and many other trees—to the mineral baths, and a grand Spanish aqueduct, more than 200 years old, just outside the city walls, with lovely views, and the Guadalupe shrine. Then we returned in delicious, but not too hot, sunshine to the “casa,” where we dined— the usual kind of lesser Mexican food, which, however, I thought superior to the Spanish of the same grade, being happily innocent of garlic; after which, having arrayed myself in a black lace mantilla and fan “á la española,” we proceeded through the charming and extensive park to the Plaza de Toros, where a “funcion” takes place every Sunday afternoon.",

Still rising, higher and higher, with lovely vales below, till the highest point, 8,133 feet, is reached at Marquéz,, through rows and masses of agaves and yuccas and cacti, then descending a thousand feet or so to Tula, the ancient capital of the wonderful Toltec civilization, situated in the loveliest valley imaginable, gorgeous with flowers and exquisite foliaged trees glistening in the golden sunshine; through which we speed, coming into sight of the “Tajo de Nochis tongo,” a huge canal begun by the Spaniards in 1607, from 200 to 600 feet wide, and nearly 200 feet deep, for the purpose of draining the great lakes in the valley of Mexico. It was never finished, but there seems now some prospect of its continuation, at a proposed cost of eight million dollars. A little further on we see one of the most interesting sights in the world, the high-placed Valley of Mexico, with its distant ranges of hills and its two gigantic sentinels, rose-red in the last rays of the setting sun—the steep, pyramid-like Popocatepetl (“Hill that smokes”) rearing its sharp cone of snow, 17,780 feet into the blue, rose-flaked sky; and Ixtaccihuatl (“the white woman”) about 16,000 feet in height, but broader in shape, created, as it were, with a snow-white woman's form resting on its for ever cloud-wreathed summit.",

    "Description":"Next morning (November 16th) we breakfasted at 6:30 and walked immediately afterwards to the Plaza Mayor, which we had dimly seen the previous evening. It is a very fine square, of great size, the centre of all the principal “callés” (streets), with a charming garden, the Zocola, well laid out with walks and ornamental trees and excellent turf, and flower-beds and seats in the centre; one side of the square entirely occupied by lovely groves, from which rises the grand imposing mass of the huge fortress-like cathedral, with a facade of 425 feet, a height of 180, and a length of 200 feet, consecrated in 1573. Two massive towers, 218 feet high, were added at the west end later, and were not completed till 1731. Several lesser tower-like projections, and two grand domes rising above capillas: the roof itself rising here and there into irregular, domelike projections, with the vastly solid and picturesque effect that is seen in all the great cathedrals of Mexico, and so many of those of Spain. The massive walls are much sculptured in the elaborately florid style of the later and inferior Spanish renaissance; but the general effect of the whole gigantic pile is exceedingly fine and imposing, towering high above all the surrounding, buildings, and forming a magnificent centre to the city: the beautiful trees and gardens that surround it adding immense charm to its general appearance. At the east end the cathedral is joined by the Sagrario, in which marriages and baptisms take place. It adds largely to the great mass of building, but its walls are decorated in the most debased “churriguresque” style. Another entire side of the plaza is occupied by the immense Palacio Nacional, 675 feet long, the city residence of the President of the Republic, which also includes most of the government offices. The whole of the side opposite to it is taken up by shops of various kinds, especially booksellers', interrupted by openings for two or three callés, and the City Hall. Opposite the cathedral the principal street, Callé de San Francisco, leads to the Alameda, a beech-shaded promenade with pretty gardens, in close proximity to the magnificent Pasco de la Reforma, where the beauty and fashion of the city disports itself on horseback and in carriages (unfortunately almost invariably closed) every afternoon from 4 till sunset, with the addition, on Sundays, of a “church parade,” from noon till 1 p.m. We wandered about, viewing the exterior of the cathedral from various points of view, till 10 o'clock, at which hour the Museo Nacional is to be seen till twelve. It is situated at the back of the Palacio Nacional, and is a large handsome building into which you enter through a great archway and hall, leading into an exquisite patio beautifully laid out with geometrically-shaped flower beds full of the loveliest and most brilliant flowers, and masses of rose trees and dwarf mandarins, all one sheet of bloom; the air filled with their delicious fragrance and the murmur of fountains of the clearest and most sparkling water, the hot sunshine tempered by giant palms, and two still more gigantic Poinsettia trees, dazzlingly resplendent in their superb scarlet foliage. You walk across the lovely garden, and enter through a wide archway into the huge oblong hall in which stand the wondrous monuments of Aztec civilization, and also those of its unparalleled brutality.",

One could fancy what must have been the dazzling effect, in the brilliant sunshine, of these barbaric but gorgeous warriors, clad in chain-armour of gold or silver, covering their inner, padded, cotton-quilted shirt, so excellent for defence, and adopted by the conquerors; their shoulders covered with mantles of exquisite feather-work, their heads adorned with gorgeous plumes, their faces masked with representations of birds or wild animals; their shining spears and glittering shields, and brandishing staffs shaped liked quadruple scythes, with formidable blades of tetzli (obsidian) sharpened to an edge nearly as trenchant as steel.",

A short distance of sandy and grassy plain, after which (as from Jalapa) many miles of jungle and the wondrous vegetation, flowers, and birds of the steaming “tierra caliente;” slowly and gradually rising to a height of 1,500 feet at Paso del Macho, where the mountainous glories of the ascent begin, and where the tremendously powerful “Fairlie” engine is substituted for the ordinary locomotive. The train winds in endless curves, up the steep gradient—at a foot's pace, luckily, so that there is time to see well—crossing wild gorges on curved bridges supported by trestles at fearful and dizzy heights, the slopes of the mountains covered with glorious vegetation; giant mahogany, zapote, rosewood, and cedar trees almost smothered in brilliant festooned masses of orchids, the air heavy with delicious aroma and perfume; the mountain-chains rising in stupendous masses above all this glory of foliage and flowers. Divine little humming-birds darting about, like coloured flashes of flame! bigger birds, feathered in every hue of the rainbow; over the Atoyac river, with its precipitous falls shaded with exquisite verdure; stopping from time to time at little stations filled with picturesque groups of Mexican women in their graceful blue draperies, carrying baskets brimming over with every variety of gorgeous and delicious fruit, which they offer for a few cents, with soft and caressing little cries of “ Nino! nina!” to attract attention—oranges, citrons, pineapples, bananas, pomegranates, grapes, figs, mango-manilla, and many other tempting and exquisite fruits that we had never before seen or heard of—also pulque, which did not tempt.",

So, mindful of the warning of the friendly doctor, we closed our windows and sat patiently in the train till, in due time, it moved on. For some time we had been coming into full sight of the great Pico de Orizaba (18,250 feet high, the highest of the North American mountains), towering its radiant dome of silver high into the soft blue skies, held up aloft, as it were, by mighty walls of rock, giant precipices, and chains of peaked massive mountains: soft, deep blue, vapoury mists playing and floating over their rugged crags, and the steaming forests of tropical vegetation beneath.",

It was dedicated to Quetzalcoatl (plumed serpent), god of the air, and representative of the planet Venus, whose black statue, resplendent with gold and jewels, and decorated with two crosses, stood enshrined in the magnificent teocalli erected on the broad platform of the prehistoric Mound—still the great object of archeeological, as in those days of religious, pilgrimage—built in the form of a truncated pyramid. The enormous square base—1,423 feet in length (double that of the great Pyramid of Ghizeh) covered a space of 44 acres, and was built in four diminishing terraces, the uppermost platform measuring more than one acre—its square sides each 165 feet long; it was anciently surmounted by the great teocalli dedicated to the god of air—destroyed and replaced, after the conquest, by the still extant church of “la Virgen de los Remedios”—the front of which commands a superb view of the rich plain and the great volcanoes, including the glory of Orizaba. The terraces of this famous pyramid are now so over-grown with vegetation as to be almost obliterated, but here and there can be distinguished; and a stone-paved winding road to the summit discovers, in its cuttings, alternate strata of clay and brick; but whether the interior of the mound was natural, or wholly artificial, is not known.",

It was too late to see the interior, which was closed, so we walked round examining the beautiful exterior; then round the plaza with its many fountains and brilliant flower beds and rows of orange, lemon, and citron trees, and grand palms and exotic shrubs, listening to the charming music and watching the promenading citizens, poor and rich, in their gay and picturesque attire—the air balmy and warm, redolent of delicious perfume. We looked into several rich and brilliantly-lighted shops at the further end of the plaza, passing, on its opposite side, the huge and handsome block of buildings constituting the palacio del Gobierno, to our hotel, just round the corner, the “Gran Humboldt,” most comfortable, airy, and clean; all the bedrooms on the first floor opening on to a charming wide cloister-like brick terrace full of flowers and plants in tubs. It is entirely open on the four inner sides overlooking the central patio, which is of course open to the sky, and in which a fountain of many jets sprinkles and refreshes great orange and palm trees; roses and jasmine and flowering creepers twining round and up the supports and balustrades of the brick terrace, which is covered with little round tables gaily decked with flowers, where one takes one's meals al fresco.",

    "Description":"The Americans are very proud of the city of San Antonio, as being one of their oldest, dating from about 1690, when it was built by the Spaniards: Texas at; that period having belonged to Mexico, under the rule of Spain. It still retains many of its Spanish features—the plaza de Alamo being surrounded by the principal buildings, amongst which the Spanish fortress-church of the Alamo is the great point of interest. In 1836 this fortified church was besieged by the Mexicans under General Santa Anna, Texas having declared for independence; and after twelve days of gallant resistance was carried by assault, and the whole of the little American garrison of 165 men, under Crockett, ruthlessly slaughtered. “Remember Alamo” became the American cry—fully avenged during the Mexican War. The plaza is adorned with fine groves of Alamo trees (cotton-wood), an opera house and the Federal Building. The San Antonio river winds in and out through the city, and the Plaza de las Yslas is prettily decorated with groves of orange trees, and the Plaza de Armas contains a fine city hall, and the cathedral, of somewhat imposing exterior but very poor interior. The climate is thought to be exceedingly agreeable and equable, and much recommended for consumptives. There are pleasant drives in various directions outside the town, especially those leading to the interesting old (for U.S.A. i.e. dating from about 1731) Spanish “missions,” two or three of which are extremely picturesque, mostly built of adobe, and in the usual solid castellated style with handsome cloisters, planted round with beautiful groves of trees and gardens. It was a lovely day, and very pleasant wandering among these Spanish memories, and the extensive parks and the green banks of the lazily-flowing river, and then to a more distant moorland where, we were told, we should find a lovely lake, which, after a long, long walk, turned out to be a very tiny one—a mere pond, in fact—but the whole scene pretty in the sunset rays.",

Many of the streets are broad and well shaded with beautiful trees, and many lovely lemon and orange groves and gardens full of bright flowers adorn the squares. The Cathedral of St. Louis is imposing, and many of the public and other buildings are handsome, but the city did not strike us as an agreeable or healthy place to live in, most of it standing below the level of the river at high water, and having to be protected by an embankment fourteen feet high and fifteen wide, which does not always prevent its being nearly swamped. It is curious to think of this city and the whole State of, Louisiana, at that time of such gigantic extent—now divided into twelve great states and territories—sold to the United States by Napoleon I., in 1803, for fifteen million dollars! One quarter of the city remains entirely French, and prides itself on the great beauty and grace of its fair Creole inhabitants. A certain amount of dark Spanish beauty is also to be seen, but the painful negro race predominates over these and other European settlers. There are no parks to speak of, but the cemeteries are exceedingly fine and extensive, full of handsome monuments shaded by huge and magnificent magnolias and live oaks, and grand avenues of venerable cypresses with their hoary covering of gray Spanish moss.",

In short, nothing of its kind could be finer or more gay 233 than this plaza, brilliant electric light and an exquisite moon shining upon its fountains and rich vegetation, and still more lovely next morning in brilliant sunshine and radiant blue sky. The “Cordoba,” too, is excellent and very handsome. We breakfasted at 6.30 and then walked into the plaza and beyond it to Fort Marion, fine and extensive fortifications, guarded from inroad of water by it strong sea-wall, the whole built of “coquina”—it curious stone found in quarries on the beach, consisting entirely of minute portions of shells crushed into one solid mass—fronting the sparkling narrow arm of sea which divides the mainland from front the wooded island of Anastasia. The view from the high ramparts of Fort Marion (which took a century to build, and was begun by the Spaniards in 1656) is very pleasing. We were shown over the fort by a charming old soldier who, in his own person, constitutes the entire garrison, and who had seen much service, and had written an excellent little abridged history of Florida, entitled “Ponce de Leon land” in remembrance of the ill-fated discoverer of this flowery ]and, who —seven years before Cortes set foot in Mexico—in the loveliness of its flowery spring tide, landed here on April 3rd, 1512, that day being Easter Sunday—in Spanish the feast of “Pascua Florida”—to commemorate which he gave the land the name of Florida.",

    "Description":"AT first the line turns inland, as far as Palatka, on the S. John's river, then outward again. till it touches the coast at Ormond—a very attractive sea resort. The aspect of the country is everywhere much the same. Pine forests, with occasional clearings for ranches surrounded by orange plantations, a soil of silvery, very fine white sand, densely covered with palmetto and wild orange trees. It is bright and pretty, but after a time becomes a little monotonous, except in the richer districts, where you simply revel in gorgeous fruit-land, and fancy yourself transported into the golden garden of the Hesperides. At Ormond begins the Indian River, so called, which is really not a river at all, but merely a still, motionless, salt-water lagoon, lying parallel with the ocean, with which it is connected by one or two narrow inlets, and from which it is divided by a narrow strip of land, for a distance of 218 miles, its breadth varying from about 100 yards to 6 miles. It is a dreamy, sheeny expanse of oily water, taking beautiful-reflections of exquisite shades of blue; and its banks are mostly clothed with rich vegetation—grand palms and magnolias, giant yuccas, fig trees, vines, and vast groves of orange trees, one glowing mass of golden, delicious fruit. In some parts, forests of grand pine, and huge cypresses overhung with their usual drapery of Spanish moss; with dense. undergrowth of palmetto, concealing under its bright green foliage savages, such as wild cats of hideous strength and ferocity, scorpions, “rattle” and innumerable other venomous snakes, and giant centipedes horrible to behold and deadly to feel, which everywhere abound in the wilder parts, where pumas and bears may occasionally be also seen. Nowhere are more deadly reptiles and insects found than in this bland and smiling Florida. From Ormond the train runs the whole way close to the edge of the flat western shore of the river, passing many prosperous little towns; the oily water taking exquisite tints of rose and scarlet as the sun sank low—its setting followed by a marvellous afterglow of vividest orange and crimson—fading suddenly into semi-darkness. At 10 p.m. we reached, in brilliant moonlight, Lake Worth, at the southern extremity of the river, where the train stops within a few yards of the immense and magnificent Hotel Poinciana, fronting the shining lake, and surrounded by exquisite terraced gardens and superb avenues and groves of graceful cocoa-palm and every variety of exotic shrub and tree and brilliant flower. Next day was a dream of tranquil, delicious, beauty—the charm of charms, to wander away to eastward, through groves of lemon and palm, and great aromatic shady trees, over a sandy path matted with flowers, guided and drawn by the ever-alluring song of the sea, only one little quarter of a mile away.",

Here the orange groves are perfectly superb—giant trees simply weighed down with fruit; huge grape-fruit (pomelo) trees, of which the fruit looks like golden cannon-balls, thousands ripe on each tree. Pomegranates, Japanese persimmons (a beautiful scarlet fruit), tamarinds, figs, mangoes, pintee (Chinese peach), kumguats, a delicious little fruit looking like a tiny orange, but belonging to the citrus family—in short, there is simply no end to the exquisite fruit plantations, all carefully placed at the right distance and watered and kept in the most admirable order, all the houses pretty and neat, each with its veranda embowered in brilliant flowers, inviting repose with its numerous rocking-chairs, and each with its surrounding fragrant and lovely garden. In this land of innumerable lakes, Winter Park of course is not without; and the pretty white-sanded shores that surround its pond are fragrant with exquisite lemon groves. In bathing in this and other lakes in Florida the risk has to be run of swarming insects, very minute, which burrow in the feet or legs of the bather, and there lay their eggs, with most unpleasant results, for it is almost impossible to extra them. After wandering for a long time in this true garden of the Hesperides, we went to the Hotel Rogers, a charming little house—one mass of jasmine and roses, daturas, and bignonias. A delightful wide balcony above, into which the bedrooms open, as well as below, full of flowers and rocking-chairs. A lovely garden all round, and indescribably beautiful and magnificent orange trees, literally covered with fruit in all stages of size and colour, from the most delicate shades of green and pale yellow to deep gold, the scent of the flowers too delicious for words. After dark, and we had returned from the most enchanting walk through this wonderful fruit-land, a violent thunder-storm came on, torrents of rain refreshing the beautiful trees, and still more bringing out their exquisite fragrance. Next morning the clouds had cleared, and the sky was blue and serene as ever, and the time passed rapidly and delightfully, wandering amid these endless groves of trees, as striking for their lofty and beautiful forms as for their incredible wealth of fruit; passing, among many fine villas, the huge Seminole Hotel, not yet open for the winter; sketching and visiting with our kind and hospitable landlady, Mrs. Rogers, her superb plantations of fruit trees.",

    "Description":"At 10 p.m. we reached Tampa Bay, every moment vividly lighted up by the lightning, which continued to superbly illumine the sky the whole night. Fortunately the train, as itwere, drives up to the door of the great hotel, so we merely had to alight and run in, to find ourselves in a sort of Aladdin's palace. It accommodates with comfort 1,000 persons. Lofty and wide galleries rather than corridors, richly carpeted, the sides lined with rows of magnificent vases of every description of china and majolica, and superb cloisonné from China and Japan, holding the loveliest exotic plants and immense palms, tree-ferns and bamboos. The suites of “parlours,” exquisitely decorated and furnished; priceless French specimens, several of which had belonged to Marie Antoinette; tapestry and paintings, wonderful collections of old china, and choicest old Venetian glass—in short, a luxury and lavish magnificence that would be incredible were it not for the fact that Mrs. Plant, the wife of the millionaire head of the great “Plant line” of railroads and steamers to which this palatial hotel belongs, looks upon it as her “country-house,” and has furnished and decorated it with all the splendid and beautiful things that she has collected from all over the world....Next morning (December 14th) a cloudless sky and radiant sunshine revealed fresh beauties. The whole immense frontage of the hotel is occupied by a wide, raised stone veranda one mass of the most exquisite flowering creepers, gorgeous yellow alamandas, Cape Jasmine, Marshal-Niel roses, and every description of beautiful flowering shrub in the broad flower-bed that borders it, of which the hibiscus are especially beautiful, one mass of bloom, vivid scarlet and delicate rose-pink, and the “royal Poincianas,” of magnificent size and graceful beauty. From this immense veranda grand flights of steps descend into the garden and shrubberies, which are on the same gigantic and superb scale as the hotel, exquisitely laid out with fountains surrounded by beds of the rarest and most brilliant and beautiful flowers—every imaginable flowering shrub and plant—all carefully labelled with their botanical as well as more ordinary names, and the original habitat of each.",

    "Description":"The far-famed Silver Springs! the “fountain of eternal youth,” sought for, far and wide, in vain, by the unhappy Ponce de Léon! These Springs, said to have been the fabled, “youth-renewing fountain” of Indian tradition are unutterably beautiful! a large and wide nearly circular basin, several acres in extent, is surrounded by low white rocks covered with lichen and moss of a deep rich velvety green, beyond which rise brilliant masses of feathery poplars of every shade of vivid gold and tender rose; and a background of tall shadowy cypresses, all closely veiled and shrouded in silvery moss, endless rows of spectral phantoms guarding the wells; the water itself, a miracle of beauty—smooth as a polished mirror, clear as crystal, its glassy, sheeny surface ever-changing from subtle tint to tint—tints for which there are no words; so delicately and insensibly, like strains of music almost too fine for human ear, playing from etherealized greens of every exquisite shade to gold, with heavenly notes of bright blue, and glittering silver, and rich, broad bands of glorious purple, shading to crimson and orange; and all this radiant sumptuousness of crystal unutterable colour so infinitely and luminously transparent, that, from the edge of the rocks, you gaze down, sixty feet deep, and see distinctly, through tremulously waving rays of light, the silvery sandy floor covered with little pearly shells, and myriads of darting fishes, and green-gold delicate waving grasses—all weaving and blending into more and more exquisite harmonies of prismatic lovely colour and shine. It seems a desecration, but you get into a little boat, and glide over the wonderful expanse, and see the silvery fountains bubbling up, and at the centre, gaze down fathomless depths, into a fearful chasm betwixt two snow-white chains of rock, rifted violently asunder, so limpidly clear the crystal element, that you feel the boat should sink down, and down, there being, apparently, nothing tangible for it to float on! Several times a week, rushes into this ideal fairy-pool, a fussing little steamer of strange unwieldy shape, beating and stirring the silver surface with noisy, irreverent screw; and a mill dares to make use of the glassy water, and profane swimmers plunge into its ice-cold depths—but nothing makes less the ever-serene and pellucid beauty of this marvellous magic mirror.",

Its east end is “Battery,” a grand esplanade 500 yards long, which commands a magnificient view of the extensive harbour and shipping, and the opposite “South Battery,” and Forts Sumter and Moultrie and sundry small islands—the scene of the first conflict of the Federals and Confederates (March 4th, 1861). South Carolina (so-called after Charles II.) which, even so far back as 1832, had declared for complete independence and autonomy of each separate state, was the first, in virtue of the “States'-rights doctrine,” to pass an ordinance of secession on December 20th, 1860, an example which was followed by the six other “Cotton States” in the following February....Next morning, December 24th, I started early to see the famous Gardens of Magnolia on the river Ashley, which in the spring must be perfectly lovely; full of the most superb tree azaleas, many of them 30 feet high, and huge japonicas and magnolias. Then back to the city, down Meeting Street, in which are the principal churches—the public buildings being mostly in the prettily-planted square close by, the centre of which is occupied by a statue of William Pitt (afterwards Earl of Chatham), erected in 1770, in gratitude for his great services to America in driving the French out of Canada, and his constant efforts and protestations, after his resignation of office in 1761, against the arbitrary policy of George III. towards colonial America; and in particular the repeal of the obnoxious Stamp Act in 1766 through his influence—as well as his eloquent and untiring denunciations, after his final resignation in 1768, of the aggravated persistence in that fatal policy.",

    "Description":"The ponies trotted merrily down the steep and slippery zig-zag road, through the fragrant pine wood to the nearly ice-bound river below, across the bridge, making straight for the snowy spectres of my last night's view—their desolate snowfields sparkling and glittering in the sunlight, the cold intense, but most exhilarating! The road more and more icy and slippery as we rose into the snowy hearts of the hills, passing lovely sheltered hollows and plantations of every variety of rare and beautiful fir and pine. For miles through the admirably-kept estate of Biltmore, which looks like one vast pleasure-ground—a picturesque occasional cottage and trim little garden. At last the mountains opened into a vast expanse of smiling valley bathed in sunshine, itself exquisitely undulating, and we reached the extraordinarily grand and beautiful site on which Mr. George Vanderbilt has built his magnificent country house. It is a site perfect and unique in its delicate and in finitely poetic beauty. The entire environings—especially as seen from the point of view of a graceful white marble kiosk at the further extremity of the beautiful green lawn adjoining the chateau—indescribably lovely and superbly stately. It is a place where only old-world minuets should be danced and poetry spoken! No profane noises should be allowed to mar the infinite sense of sublime, reposeful peace, and dreamy, poetic harmony! You see before you a sunshiny arcadian valley, serene and smiling, of grand and majestic width and limitless length; its far western horizon guarded by endless blue lovely chains of hills and snow-crowned peaks, stretching from far south to north, as far as eye can reach, into dimmest distance, melting and vanishing into misty, vapoury, vague mystery that might be sunlit sea or sky. Eastward rise beautifully wooded hills, and in the far north, snowy peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains, the sun-bathed valley restfully shining between in the golden light. The house itself is an immense and handsome castellated palace. Its west front stands sheer up on the very edge of a high, bold, rocky bluff, rising perpendicularly, with very fine effect, from the green vale. On the entrance side, facing east, a wide terrace stretches to the foot of a high, white marble wall and sculptured balustrade, in front of which a, triple fountain plays out of exquisitely carved white marble basins, on each side of which grand flights of wide white marble steps ascend to a beautiful terraced Italian garden, beyond which a gentle acclivity of exquisitely green turf, worthy of England, leads to the wooded heights above. The vista, from this terrace, of chateau, valley, and distant hills, is superb, but the loveliest point of view is the one I have already described.",

The Western shore is discovered as far as seventy odd degrees. Whether it be a large island, or borders upon countries to the North, is not yet found out; there seems great reason to believe it is contiguous to America on the North West side; because there we meet with the bay or inlet, which in the sea charts is called Davis’s Straits, from an Englishman, who in the year 1585 was the first discoverer of it; and is yearly frequented by ships of different nations, on account of the Whale Fishery: but nobody as yet has been able to find out the bottom of it.",

For, although the Norway colonies were destroyed, yet there were, no doubt, some remains of them, which joined with the natives and became all one nation.

Everybody must and does see Geneva. It is the capital of the smallest canton in Switzerland but one, the entire territory being but fifteen miles long by as many square, a large portion of this being taken up by the lake.

The approach to this harbour is long and circuitous, for a vessel has to wind hither and thither to avoid shoals; and as the channel is ill-buoyed, careful captains sometimes wait for the tide to be at least half full before they cross the shallowest part, where there may be only twenty feet of water at low tide. Within the harbour there is plenty of good deep anchorage opposite the town, and a still more sheltered spot is found a little farther up the inlet in a sort of lagoon. The town, which is growing fast, but still in a rough and unsightly condition, runs for half a mile along the bay front, while behind a suburb is built up the slope of a hill facing to the west. The site looks healthy enough, though it would have been better to plant the houses nearer to the high point which shields the anchorage. But behind the town to the east and north there are large swamps, reeking with malaria; and the residents have, therefore, though of course much less in the dry season, to be on their guard against fever, which, indeed, few who remain for a twelvemonth escape. The Portuguese Government is unfortunately hard pressed for money and has not been able to complete the projected quays, nor even to provide a custom-house and warehouses fit to receive and store the goods intended for the Transvaal, which are now discharged here in large quantities. In November, 1895, everything was in confusion, and the merchants loud in their complaints.",

    "Description":"Rio de Janeiro, or the river of Januarius, was probably so called from its having been discovered on the feast-day of that saint; and the town, which is the capital of the Portuguese dominions in America, derives its name from the river, which, indeed, is rather an arm of the sea, for it did not appear to receive any considerable stream of fresh water: it stands on a plain, close to the shore, on the west side of the bay, at the foot of several high mountains which rise behind it. It is neither ill designed nor ill built: the houses, in general, are of stone, and two stories high; every house having, after the manner of the Portuguese, a little balcony before its windows, and a lattice of wood before the balcony. I computed its circuit to be about three miles; for it appears to be equal in size to the largest country towns in England, Bristol and Liverpool not excepted: the streets are straight, and of a convenient breadth, intersecting each other at right angles; the greater part, however, lie in a line with the citadel called St. Sebastian, 33which stands on the top of a hill that commands the town.",

They found the country about the bay to be in general flat, the bottom of it in particular was a plain covered with grass, which might easily have been made into a large quantity of hay; they found also abundance of good wood and water, and fowl in great plenty. Among other things, of which nature has been liberal in this place, is Winter’s bark, Winteranea aromatica; which may easily be known by its broad leaf, shaped like the laurel, of a light green colour without, and inclining to blue within; the bark is easily stripped with a bone or a stick, and its virtues are well known; it may be used for culinary purposes 48as a spice, and is not less pleasant than wholesome: here is also plenty of wild celery and scurvy-grass. The trees are chiefly of one kind, a species of the birch, called Betula antarctica; the stem is from thirty to forty feet long, and from two to three feet in diameter, so that in a case of necessity they might possibly supply a ship with top-masts; they are a light white wood, bear a small leaf, and cleave very straight. Cranberries were also found here in great plenty, both white and red.",

This decoration seems to be more profuse and elaborate upon particular occasions; for the two gentlemen who introduced Mr. Banks and the Doctor into the town were almost covered with streaks of black in all directions, so as to make a very striking appearance. Both men and women wore bracelets of such beads as they could make themselves of small shells or bones; the women both upon their wrists and ancles, the men upon their wrists only: but to compensate for the want of bracelets on their legs, they wore a kind of fillet of brown worsted round their heads. They seemed to set a particular value upon any thing that was red, and preferred beads even to a knife or a hatchet.",

Mr. Banks also, about this time, found a large cuttle-fish, which had just been killed by the birds, floating in a mangled condition upon the water; it is very different from the cuttle-fishes that are found in the European seas; for its arms, instead of suckers, were furnished with a double row of very sharp talons, which resemble those of a cat, and, like them, were retractable into a sheath of skin, from which they might be thrust at pleasure. Of 75this cuttle-fish we made one of the best soups we had ever tasted.",

The soil where we constructed our fort was sandy, and this made it necessary to strengthen the intrenchments with wood; three sides were to be fortified in this manner; the fourth was bounded by a river, upon the banks of which I proposed to place a proper number of water-casks. This day we served pork to the ship’s company for the first time, and the Indians brought down so much bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that we found it necessary to send away part of them unbought, and to acquaint them by signs, that we should want no more for two days to come.",

    "Description":"As we were returning to the boat, however, we were entertained with a sight that in some measure compensated for our fatigue and disappointment. In our way we came to one of the few places where access to the island is not guarded by a reef, and, consequently, a high surf breaks upon the shore; a more dreadful one, indeed, I had seldom seen; it was impossible for any European boat to have lived in it; and if the best swimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been exposed to its fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to preserve himself from drowning, especially as the shore was covered with pebbles and large stones; yet, in the midst of these breakers, were ten or twelve Indians swimming for their amusement: whenever a surf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all appearance with infinite facility, rose again on the other side. This diversion was greatly improved by the stern of an old canoe, which they happened to find upon the spot: they took this before them, and swam out with it as far as the outermost breach, then two or three of them getting into it, and turning the square end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the shore with incredible rapidity, sometimes almost to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way, in which case they dived, and rose on the other side with the canoe in their 138hands: they then swam out with it again, and were again driven back, just as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich-park for the pleasure of rolling down it. At this wonderful scene we stood gazing for more than half an hour, during which time none of the swimmers attempted to come on shore, but seemed to enjoy their sport in the highest degree; we then proceeded in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort.",

For three hours, more or less, we had advanced through a flat and open country, when four Turkish horsemen appeared in the distance; my Hungarians, however, continued to ride with me, until at last I advised them to retire, fearing that, if they came nearer, some troublesome breach of the peace might ensue. When the Turks saw me coming, they rode up, and, halting by my carriage, saluted me. In this manner we advanced a short distance, conversing with each other, for I had a lad who acted as interpreter.\n \n I was not expecting any addition to my escort, when suddenly, as we came to a spot a little below the level of the rest of the country, I found myself surrounded by a troop of 150 horsemen, or thereabouts.\n \n I had never seen such a sight before, and I was delighted with the gay colours of their shields and spears, their jewelled scimitars, their many-coloured plumes, their turbans of the purest white, their robes of purple and dark green, their gallant steeds and superb accoutrements.\n \n The officers ride up, give me a courteous welcome, congratulate me on my arrival, and ask whether I have had a pleasant journey. I reply in terms befitting the occasion, and so they escort me to Gran, which consists of a fort situated on a hill, at the foot of which flows the Danube, and a town hard by on the plain, where I take up my quarters. The archbishop of this place stands first among the nobles of Hungary both in rank and wealth. My lodging had more of the camp than the city. Instead of beds there were planks covered with coarse woollen rugs; there were no mattresses, no linen. And so my attendants had their first taste of Turkish luxury | As for myself, I had brought my bed with me.",

    "Description":"I left Gran after a breakfast, which had to serve for a dinner as well, as there was no resting-place between it and Buda.\n \n In spite of my entreaties that he would spare himself the trouble of paying me so great an attention, the Busbecq's explanation is correct. The word may possibly be a corruption of the Latin signum. It is now applied to the district which was formerly governed by a Sanjak-bey, i.e., Lord of the standard.\n \n Sanjak-bey must needs escort me with all his household, and the cavalry under his command. As the horsemen poured out of the gates they engaged in mimic warfare, and also performed several feats, one of which was to throw a ball on the ground, and to carry it off on the lance's point when at full gallop.\n \n [...]\n \n As I drew near to the city I was met by a few Turks, who were by profession- cavasses. These cavasses act as officials, and execute the orders of the Sultan and Pashas. The position of cavasse is considered by the Turks to be one of high honour.\n \n \n [...]\n \n I was conducted to the house of a Hungarian gentleman, where, I declare, my luggage, carriage, and horses were better treated than their owner. The first thing the Turks attend to is to get carriages, horses, and luggage into safe quarters; as for human beings they think they have done quite enough for them, if they are placed beyond the reach of wind and weather.\n \n [...]\n \n At Buda I made my first acquaintance with the Janissaries; this is the name by which the Turks call he infantry of the royal guard. The Turkish state has 12,000 of these troops when the corps is at its full strength. They are scattered through every part of the empire, either to garrison the forts against the enemy, or to protect the Christians and Jews from the violence of the mob. There is no district with any considerable amount of population, no borough or city, which has not a detachment of Janissaries to protect the Christians, Jews, and other helpless people from outrage and wrong. ) A garrison of Janissaries is always stationed in the citadel of Buda. The dress of these men consists of a robe reaching down to the ankles, while, to cover their heads, they employ a cowl which, by their account, was originally a cloak sleeve,\" part of which contains the head, while the remainder hangs down and flaps against the neck. On their forehead is placed a silvergilt cone of considerable height, studded with stones of no great value.\n \n [...]\n \n I shall not have time to give you a full description of the good town of Buda, but that I may not pass it over altogether, I will give you a sketch of such sort as is suitable for a letter, though it would not be sufficient for a book. The town is built on the side of a hill, in a most delightful situation, the country around being rich and fertile. On the one side it is bordered by vine-clad hills, and on the other it commands a view of the Danube, as it flows past its walls, with Pesth beyond, and the broad fields on the other side of the river. Well might this town be selected as the royal capital of Hungary. In past times it was adorned with the magnificent palaces of the Hungarian nobility, some of which have fallen down, while others are only kept from falling by a liberal use of props and stays. The inmates of these mansions are generally Turkish soldiers, who, as their daily pay is all they have to live on, can spare nothing for the purpose of mending the walls or patching the roofs of these vast buildings.\n \n Accordingly, they do not take it to heart if the roof lets in rain or the wall cracks, provided they can find a dry spot to stable their horses and make their own bed. As to the chambers above, they think it is no concern of theirs; so they leave the rats and mice in full enjoyment of them. Another reason for this negligence is that it is part of the Turkish creed to avoid display in the matter of buildings; they consider that a man proves himself a conceited fellow, who utterly misunderstands his position, if he aims at having a pretentious house, for he shows thereby, according to their notion, that he expects himself and his house to last for ever. They profess to use houses as travellers use inns, and if their habitations protect them from robbers, give them warmth and shade, and keep off rain, they want nothing more. Through the whole of Turkey it would be hard to find a house, however exalted or rich its owner may be, built with the slightest regard to elegance. Everyone lives in a hut or cottage. The great people are fond of fine gardens and sumptuous baths, and take care to have roomy houses to accommodate their retinues; but in these you never see a bright verandah, or a hall worth looking at, nor does any sign of grandeur attract one's attention. The Hungarians also follow the same practice, for with the exception of Buda, and perhaps Presburg, you will scarcely find a city in the whole of Hungary containing buildings of any pretension whatever. For my own part, I believe that this is a very old habit of theirs, and arises from the circumstance that the Hungarians are a warlike nation, accustomed to camp life and expeditions far from home, and so, when they lived in a city, they did so as men who must shortly leave it.",

    "Description":"At Buda I made my first acquaintance with the Janissaries; this is the name by which the Turks call he infantry of the royal guard. The Turkish state has 12,000 of these troops when the corps is at its full strength. They are scattered through every part of the empire, either to garrison the forts against the enemy, or to protect the Christians and Jews from the violence of the mob. There is no district with any considerable amount of population, no borough or city, which has not a detachment of Janissaries to protect the Christians, Jews, and other helpless people from outrage and wrong. ) A garrison of Janissaries is always stationed in the citadel of Buda. The dress of these men consists of a robe reaching down to the ankles, while, to cover their heads, they employ a cowl which, by their account, was originally a cloak sleeve,\" part of which contains the head, while the remainder hangs down and flaps against the neck. On their forehead is placed a silvergilt cone of considerable height, studded with stones of no great value.",

    "Description":"Our business at Buda being thus concluded, in so far as we were able to accomplish it, my companion returned to the King, while I, with my horses, carriages, and people, embarked on some vessels which were waiting for us, and sailed down the Danube towards Belgrade. This route was not only safer than that by land, but also occupied less time, for encumbered as I was with baggage, I should have been twelve days at the very least on the road, and there would also have been danger of an attack from Heydons--for so the Hungarians call the banditti who have left their flocks and herds to become half soldiers, half brigands. By the river route there was no fear of Heydons, and the passage occupied five days. The vessel on board which I sailed was towed by a tug manned by twenty-four oarsmen; the other boats were pulled along by a pair of sweeps. With the exception of a few hours during which the wretched galley-slaves and the crew took food and rest, we travelled incessantly. I was much impressed on this occasion with the rashness of the Turks, for they had no hesitation in continuing their voyage during the night, though there was no moon and it was quite dark, amid a gale of wind. We often, to our very great danger, encountered mills and trunks and branches of trees projecting from the banks, so that it frequently happened that the boat was caught by the gale and came crashing on to the stumps and branches which lined the river side. On such occasions it seemed to me that we were on the point of going to pieces.\n \n Once, indeed, there was a great crash, and part of the deck was carried away. I jumped out of bed, and begged the crew to be more careful. Their only answer was “Alaure,' that is, “God will help us;” and so I was left to get back to my bed and my nap--if I could ! I will venture to make one prophecy, and that is, that this mode of sailing will one day bring about a disaster.",

    "Description":"Not far from Jagodin we came to a little stream, which the inhabitants call Nissus. This we kept on our right, skirting its bank until we came to Nissa (Nisch). Some way on, we found on the bank (where the traces of an old Roman road still remained) a little marble pillar with a Latin inscription, but so mutilated as to be undecipherable. Nissa is a small town of some account, to which the people of the country often resort.\n \n I must now tell you something as to the inns we make use of, for that is a subject on which you have been some time wanting information. At Nissa I lodged in the public inn, called by the Turks a caravanserai--the most common kind of inn in those parts. \n \n It consists of a huge building, the length of which somewhat exceeds the breadth. In the centre is an open space, where the camels and their baggage, as well as the mules and waggons, have to be quartered. \n \n This open space is surrounded by a wall about three feet high, and this is bonded into the outer wall surrounding the whole building. The top of the former is level, and about four feet broad. This ledge serves the Turks for bedroom and dining-room, and kitchen as well, for here and there fireplaces are built into the outer wall, which I told you encloses the whole building. So they sleep, eat, and cook on this ledge, three feet high and four feet broad; and this is the only distinction between their quarters and those of the camels, horses, and other beasts of burden. Moreover, they have their horses haltered at the foot of the ledge, so that their heads and necks come right over it; and as their masters warm themselves or take their supper, the creatures stand by like so many lackeys, and sometimes are given a crust or apple from their master's hand. On the ledge they also make their beds; first they spread out the rug which they carry for that purpose behind their saddles, on this they put a cloak, while the saddle supplies them with a pillow. . A robe, lined with skins, and reaching to the ankles furnishes their dress by day and their blanket at night. And so when they lie down they have no luxuries wherewith to provoke sleep to come to them. \n \n In these inns there is no privacy whatever; everything is done in public, and the only curtain to shield one from people's eyes is such as may be afforded by the darkness of the night.\n \n [Text goes on about hospitality and hostels.]",

A sheep costs thirty-five aspres,\" a fowl costs one; and fifty aspres make a crown. I must not forget to tell you of the dress of the women.

Before we had crossed the pass I mentioned above, we had a good view of the summit of Rhodope, which stood out cold and clear with its snowy covering.\n \n The inhabitants, if I am not mistaken, call the mountain Rulla. From it, as Pliny tells us, flows the Hebrus, a fact generally known from the couplet of Ovid :-- “Quâ patet umbrosum Rhodope glacialis ad Haemum, Et sacer amissas exigit Hebrus aquas.” In this passage the poet seems to refer to the river's want of depth and its scant supply of water; for though a great and famous stream, it is full of shallows.

    "Description":"Just before we reached Selimbria, a small town lying on the coast, we saw some well-preserved traces too of an ancient earthwork and ditch, which they say were made in the days of the later Greek emperors, and extended from the Sea of Marmora to the Danube. These fortifications were intended to defend the land and property of the people of Constantinople which lay within their defences, against the inroads of barbarians. They tell of an old man in those days who declared that the existence of these works did not so much protect what was inside, as mark the surrender of the rest to the barbarians, and so encourage them to attack, while it damped the spirit of the defenders.\n \n At Selimbria we stopped awhile to enjoy the view over the calm sea and pick up shells, while the waves rolled merrily on to the shore. We were also attracted by the sight of dolphins sporting in the waters; and, in addition to all these sights, we enjoyed the heat of that delicious clime. I cannot tell you how warm and mild the air is in this charming spot. As far as Tchourlou there was a certain amount of cold, and the wind had a touch of the North about it; but on leaving Tchourlou the air becomes extremely mild.",

    "Description":"Close to Constantinople we crossed over bridges, which spanned two lovely bays. If these places were cultivated, and nature were to receive the slightest assistance from art, I doubt whether in the whole world anything could be found to surpass them in loveliness. But the very ground seems to mourn its fate, and complain of the neglect of its barbarian master.\n \n Here we feasted on most delicious fish, caught before our eyes.\n \n While lodging in the hostels, which the Turks call Imaret, I happened to notice a number of bits of paper stuck in the walls. In a fit of curiosity I pulled them out, imagining that there must be some reason for their being placed there. I asked my Turks what was written on the paper, but I could not find that they contained anything which could account for their being thus preserved. This made me all the more eager to learn why on earth they were kept; for I had seen the same thing done in other places. My Turks made no reply, being unwilling to answer my question, either because they were shy of telling me that which I should not credit, or because they did not wish to unfold so mighty a mystery to one outside the pale of their religion. Some time later I learned from my friends among the Turks, that great respect is paid to a piece of paper, because there is a possibility that the name of God may be written on it; and therefore they do not allow the smallest scrap to lie on the ground, but pick it up and stick it quickly in some chink or crack, that it may not be trodden on. There is no particular fault, perhaps, to be found with all this ; but let me tell you the rest.\n \n [Text goes on.]",

    "Description":"I arrived at Constantinople on January 20, and there I found the colleagues I mentioned above, Antony Wranczy and Francis Zay. The Sultan was away in Asia with the Turkish army, and no one was left at Constantinople except the eunuch Ibrahim Pasha, governor of the city, and Roostem, who had been deprived of his office. Nevertheless, we visited the ex-chief-Vizier, showed him every courtesy, and gave him presents to mark our esteem ; for we did not forget the great influence he once had, and his prospect of shortly regaining it.\n \n [...]\n \n During the interval, while we were waiting for his answer, I had an opportunity of seeing Constantinople at my leisure. My chief wish was to visit the Church of St. Sophia; to which, however, I only obtained admission as a special favour, as the Turks think that their temples are profaned by the entrance of a Christian. It is a grand and massive building, well worth visiting. There is a huge central cupola, or dome, lighted only from a circular opening at the top. Almost all the Turkish mosques are built after the pattern of St. Sophia. Some say it was formerly much bigger, and that there were several buildings in connection with it, covering a great extent of ground, which were pulled down many years ago, the shrine in the middle of the church alone being left standing.\n \n As regards the position of the city, it is one which nature herself seems to have designed for the mistress of the world. It stands in Europe, Asia is close in front, with Egypt and Africa on its right; and though these last are not, in point of distance, close to Constantinople, yet, practically, the communication by sea links them to the city. On the left, are the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff. Many nations live all round the coasts of these seas, and many rivers pour into them ; so that, through the length and breadth of these countries, which border on the Black Sea, there is nothing grown for man's use, which cannot, with the greatest ease, be brought to Constantinople by water.\n \n On one side the city is washed by the Sea of Marmora, on the other the creek forms a harbour which, from its shape, is called by Strabo “the Golden Horn.' On the third side it is united to the mainland, so that its position may be described as a peninsula or promontory formed by a ridge running out between the sea on one side, and the frith on the other. Thus from the centre of Constantinople there is a most exquisite view over the sea, and of Mount Olympus in Asia, white with perpetual snow. The sea is perfectly crowded with shoals of fish making their way, after the manner of their kind, from the Sea of Azoff and the Black Sea through the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmora into the AEgean and Mediterranean, or again returning to the Black Sea. The shoals are so big, and so closely packed, that sometimes fish can be caught with the hand. Mackerel, tunnies, bigheads, bream, and sword-fish are to be had in abundance.\n \n [Comments on fishers, Greek church, as welll as other notes about peoples in area.]\n I now return to Constantinople. Nothing could exceed the beauty or the commercial advantages of its situation. In Turkish cities it is, as I told you before, useless to expect handsome buildings or fine streets; the extreme narrowness of the latter renders a good effect impossible. In many places are to be found interesting remains of ancient works of art, and yet, as regards number, the only marvel is that more are not in existence, when we remember how many Constantine brought from Rome. I do not intend to describe each of them separately, but I will touch on a few.",

There are besides two famous pillars at Constantinople, which are considered among the sights. One of them is opposite the caravanserai where we were entertained, and the other is in the market-place which the Turks call “Avret Bazaar,” i.e. the female slave market. It is engraven from top to bottom with the history of the expedition of Arcadius, who built it, and by whose statue it was long surmounted. It would be more correct to call it a spiral staircase than a column, for there is inside it a set of steps, by ascending which one can reach the top. I have a picture of it. On the other hand, the column ! which stands opposite the inn where it is usual for the imperial Ambassadors to be lodged, is formed, with the exception of its base and capital, of eight solid blocks of porphyry, united in such a way as to present the appearance of a single block. Indeed, the popular belief is that it is made out of one piece; for each separate joining is covered by a band running right round the column, on which laurels are carved. By this means the joinings are concealed from the eyes of those who look at it from the ground. Having been shaken by several earthquakes, and scorched by a fire in the neighbourhood, the column is splitting in many places, and is here and there belted with iron to prevent its coming to pieces. They say that it was at one time surmounted by a statue of Apollo, afterwards by one of Constantine, and lastly by that of Theodosius the elder, all of which were successively thrown down by a gale or an earthquake.\n \n [Story \"the Greeks tell\" about the obelisk.]",

The creature remained quite quiet, though its jaws were but just stained with blood. I saw also a young elephant which could dance and play ball most cleverly. When you read this, I am sure you will not be able to suppress a smile. “An elephant,' you will say, “dancing and playing ball !' Well, why not ? Is it more wonderful than the elephant which, Seneca tells us, walked on the tight rope, or that one which Pliny describes as a Greek scholar ?\n \n But I must make myself clear, lest you should think I am romancing, or misunderstand me. When the elephant was told to dance, it hopped and shuffled, swaying itself to and fro, as if it would dance a jig.\n \n It played ball after the following fashion :-On the ball being thrown to it, the elephant caught it cleverly, driving it back with his trunk, as we do with the palm of the hand. If this is not enough in your eyes to warrant the assertion that the animal danced and played ball, you must go to some one who can make up a story with less scruple and more wit than your humble servant.\n \n Just before I reached Constantinople there was a camelopard (giraffe) in the menagerie; but at the time of my visit it was dead and buried. However, I had its bones dug up for the purpose of examining them.\n \n The creature is much taller in front than behind, and on that account unfit for carrying burdens or being ridden. It is called a camelopard because its head and neck are like a camel's, while its skin is spotted like a pard (panther).",

    "Description":"If I had not visited the Black Sea, when I had an opportunity of sailing thither, I should have deserved to be blamed for my laziness, since the ancients held it to be quite as great an exploit to have visited the Black Sea, as to have sailed to Corinth. Well, we had a delightful voyage, and I was allowed to enter some of the royal kiosks. On the folding doors of one of these palaces I saw a picture of the famous battle between Selim and Ismael, King of the Persians, executed in masterly style, in tesselated work. I saw also a great many pleasure-grounds belonging to the Sultan, situated in the most charming valleys. Their loveliness was almost entirely the work of nature; to art they owed little or nothing. What a fairyland ! What a landscape for waking a poet's fancy! What a retreat for a scholar to retire to. \n \n In the middle of the mouth next the Black Sea is a rock with a column, on the base of which a Roman name is written in Latin characters (‘Octavian,’ if I remember rightly); then on the European shore is a lofty tower, which serves as a lighthouse to ships by night. They call it Pharos. Not far from it a brook flows into the sea, from whose bed we gathered some pebbles almost equal to the onyx and sardonyx; at any rate, when they are polished they are nearly as brilliant.\n \n I will now take you back to the sea which the ancients call Pontus and the Turks call Caradenis, or the Black Sea. It pours through a narrow outlet into the Thracian Bosphorus, down which it rolls, beating against the curving headlands with many an eddy till it reaches Constantinople after the space of one day. At this point it rushes into the Sea of Marmora by a passage almost as narrow as that by which it enters the Bosphorus.\n \n [...]\n \n One matter it would be unpardonable to pass by in silence, viz. that Polybius is utterly wrong in the conclusion which he deduces from various arguments, that in process of time the Black Sea would be so choked by the alluvial soil brought into it by the Danube, the Dneiper, and other rivers, as to become unnavigable. He is utterly wrong, I say, for there is not one atom more difficulty in sailing over the Black Sea now than there was in his days.",

The citadel, which stands on a hill, is in a better state of preservation.

    "Description":"thence to Nicaea (Isnik), which we did not reach till late in the evening. I heard not far from the city loud shouting, and what seemed to be cries of mockery and insult issuing from human lips. I asked what it was, suggesting that it might proceed from some boatmen on the Lake of Isnik, which was not far off, and that they were chaffing us for being so late on the road.\n \n They told me that it was the howlings of certain wild beasts, which the Turks call jackals. They are a species of wolf, not so large as the common wolf, but larger than foxes, and quite a match for the former in greed and gluttony. They hunt in packs, doing no harm to human beings or cattle, and obtaining their food by thievery and cunning rather than by force.\n \n Hence the Turks call sharpers and swindlers, especially if they come from Asia, jackals. They enter the tents, and even the houses, of the Turks at night, and devour any eatables they find ; indeed, if they can get nothing else, they gnaw any leathern article they may chance upon, such as boots, leggings, belts, scabbards, &c. They are very clever in this manner of stealing, except in one particular, for, absurdly enough, they sometimes give evidence against themselves. When in the very act of stealing, if one of the pack outside happens to set up a howl, they answer the cry, quite forgetting where they are. The sound awakes the inmates; they catch up their arms and visit the thieves, whom they have taken red-handed, with condign punishment.\n \n We remained the following day at Nicaea, and I am inclined to think that the building I slept in was the very one in which the Nicene Council was formerly held. Nicaea lies on the shores of the Lake of Isnik.\n \n The walls and gates of the town are in fairly good condition. There are four gateways in all, and they can be seen from the centre of the market-place. On each of them is an ancient inscription in Latin, stating that the town had been restored by Antoninus. I do not remember which Antoninus it was, but I am quite certain that it was an Antoninus, who was Emperor. He also built some baths, the remains of which are still in existence.\n \n Whilst we were at Nicaea, some Turks, who were digging up stone from the ruins for the construction of public buildings at Constantinople, came across a statue of an armed soldier, of excellent workmanship, and almost perfect. But with their hammers they soon reduced it to a shapeless mass. On our expressing vexation at this act of theirs, the workmen jeered at us, and asked us if we wanted, in accordance with our customs, to worship the statue and pray to it.",

Moreover, our Turks assured us that there was no need for hurry, as the Persian Ambassador was still lingering on the road, and the authorities wished us both to arrive at Amasia as nearly as possible at the same time. \n \n In none of the villages mentioned above did we see anything worth notice, save that, among the Turkish burial places we sometimes lighted on ancient columns, or blocks of fine marble, on which traces still remained of Greek and Roman inscriptions, but so mutilated that they could not be read. It was my amusement, on reaching our lodgings for the night, to inquire for ancient inscriptions, or coins of Greece or Rome, and, if these were not forthcoming, for rare plants. \n \n It is a practice of the Turks to cover in the tombs of their friends with huge stones, which they bring from a great distance. No earth is thrown upon the graves, and but for these stones they would lie open. They are intended to furnish the dead man with a convenient seat when he pleads his case, as he will have to do--according to their notion--with his evil angel as his accuser and examiner, and his good angel as counsel for the defence. The object of placing a heavy stone on the grave is to protect the body from dogs, wolves, and other beasts; the most pertinacious of which is the hyena, a creature often met with in these parts. It burrows its way into the graves, pulls out the bodies, and carries them off to its den, the mouth of which is marked by a huge heap of bones of men, horses, and other animals. The hyena is a creature not quite so tall as a wolf, but quite as long in body. Its skin resembles that of a wolf, except that the hair is rougher, and it is also marked with large black spots; the head is firmly attached to the backbone, without any joint between, so that when it wants to look back it must turn right round. They say that it has, in the place of teeth, one continuous bone.\n \n [Text goes on about superstition regarding the hyena.]",

    "Description":"Angora formed our nineteenth halting place from Constantinople. It is a town of Galatia, and was, at one time, the head-quarters of the Tectosages, a Gallic tribe. Pliny and Strabo both mention it, but it is not improbable that the present city covers only a part of the ancient town. The Kanûns call it Anquira.\n \n Here we saw a very beautiful inscription,‚ containing a copy of the tablets in which Augustus gave a summary of his achievements. We made our people copy out as much as was legible. It is engraven on the marble walls of a building now ruinous and roofless, which formerly may have formed the official residence of the governor.\n \n As you enter the building one half of the inscription is on the right, and the other on the left. The top lines are nearly perfect; in the middle the gaps begin to present difficulties; the lowest lines are so mutilated with blows of clubs and axes as to be illegible. This is indeed a great literary loss, and one which scholars have much reason to regret; the more so as it is an ascertained fact that Ancyra was dedicated' to Augustus as the common gift of Asia.\n \n Here we also saw how the famous watered stuff, or mohair, which is woven of the hair of the goats I have already described, is dyed; and how, when water has been poured on, it takes those waves from the action of the press, from which it derives its name, and for which it is prized. The stuff which bears the mark of a very large wave, and keeps its pattern, is considered the best ; but if, in any part, smaller and uneven waves occur, although the colour and material be precisely the same, it is worth less by several gold pieces on account of the flaw. Elderly men among the Turks, when they are of high rank, are generally distinguished by dresses made of this material. Solyman prefers it to any other dress for state occasions, wearing that which is of a green colour; a hue which, according to our notions, is hardly becoming to a man of advanced years; but their religion, and the example of their prophet Mahomet, who wore it constantly, even in his old age, gives it favour in the eyes of the Turks. Among them black is considered a mean and unlucky colour, and for any one in Turkey to appear dressed in black is held to be ominous of disaster and evil. On some occasions the Pashas would express their astonishment at our going to them in black clothes, and make it a ground for serious remonstrance.",

    "Description":"From Angora we came to the village of Balygazar, thence to Zarekuct, next to Zermeczii, after which we arrived at the bank of the river Halys (Kizil Irmak).\n \n As we crossed the country towards the village of Algeos, we had a distant view of the mountains near Sinope. They have a red appearance from the red chalk which takes its name from Sinope.\n \n Here is the famous Halys, once the boundary between the kingdoms of Media and Lydia, about which the ancient prophecy said that “Croesus, if he crossed the Halys to make war on the Persians, would destroy a mighty realm'--but he did not know that the realm he was to destroy was his own. On the bank was a copse of trees, which at first excited our attention, as we thought we had discovered a new kind of fruit tree; but we soon became aware that it was the liquorice tree, and gorged ourselves with the juice from its roots.\n \n [Commentary on fishing.]\n \n Amongst other fish, we caught the common Danube shad. There are also crabs in the Halys in large numbers, which, if they are not sea crabs, are, at any rate, very like them.\n \n The Turks, who stood by, were amazed at the great pains we Christians took in fishing. “How so,' you will say, “are there no fishermen in Turkey” Well, there are some, but in those districts they are very rare. roars of laughter when we drew off the water of a stream and captured a quantity of gudgeons. They were greatly amused at our fishing for anything so small, and could not make out what gain or advantage we expected to get from them. The foolish fellows did not understand that a large supply of these little fishes enabled us to prepare big dishes of stew sufficient to dine a great many people.\n \n But these Turks live so sparingly, and care so little for the pleasures of the table, that if they have bread and salt with an onion or leek, or a kind of sour milk which Galen mentions by the name of oxygala, and they call yoghoort, they are quite content.\n \n They mix this milk with very cold water, and crumble bread into it, using it when the heat is overpowering, to allay their thirst. We, too, often found this drink most useful in hot weather, for not only is it very pleasant and wholesome, but it also has, to a remarkable degree, the power of quenching thirst.\n \n At all the caravanserais (or Turkish inns, as I explained before) there is plenty of it for sale, and other relishes are also to be bought. For the Turks do not, when travelling, require hot dishes or meat; their relishes are sour milk, cheese, dried prunes, pears, peaches, quinces, figs, raisins, cornel berries. Dainties of this description are set out for sale on great pans of earthenware, having been first boiled in plain water.\n \n Each man buys what he fancies most, and eats the fruit with his bread by way of a relish; when he has finished the fruit he drinks the water. Thus these men's food and drink costs them very little, so little, indeed, that I would venture to say that one of our people will spend more on his food in one day than a Turk does in twelve. Moreover their yearly feasts generally consist only of cakes and buns, and other confectionery, with several dishes of rice, to which they add mutton and chickens--not capons,' for poultry of that kind is unknown to the Turks. As to pheasants, thrushes, becaficos, &c., they have never even heard them mentioned. If honey or sugar be mixed with their draught of water, they would not envy Jove his nectar.\n \n [Text goes on about various drinks and grapes consumed in Constantinople, etc.]",

    "Description":"But our journey has been long and we must shortly rest. There was now only one stage, namely Baglison (Baglijah), between us and our destination, Amasia, which last we reached on April 7, thirty days after our departure from Constantinople. As we drew near we were met by some Turks, who came to congratulate us on our arrival, and to do us the compliment of escorting us into the city.\n \n Amasia is the chief town of Cappadocia, and there the governor of the province is wont to hold his courts, and to keep the main body of his troops. But even from the time of Bajazet the place seemed in some mysterious fashion to be associated with misfortune, and that this idea was not groundless is proved by the miserable end of Mustapha. Strabo tells us that this was his native place. The town lies between two ranges of hills, and the river Iris (Yeshil-Irmak) flows through its centre; so that both banks are covered with houses, which rise gradually up the sides of the hills, like the tiers of seats in a theatre; every part of the town therefore commands a view of the river, and those who live on one side of the town are completely exposed to the eyes of those who live on the other. It is, indeed, so hemmed in by hills that there is only one road by which carriages and beasts of burden can enter or leave the city.\n \n On the night of our arrival there was a great fire, which the Janissaries extinguished after their own fashion by pulling down the neighbouring buildings. How it arose I cannot say, but there is no doubt that the soldiers have good reasons for wishing for fires, for, inasmuch as they are employed to put them out, and in most cases this is only effected by pulling down the neighbouring houses, as I told you before, they pillage, not only the goods and chattels of the people whose houses are on fire, but also those of their neighbours as well. So the soldiers themselves are often guilty of incendiarism in order to get an opportunity of plundering the houses.\n \n [...]\n \n But neither the houses nor streets of Amasia have any beauty to attract one’s notice. The houses are built of white clay, almost in the same fashion as those in Spain; even the roofs are made of this material, being flat without any gable. They use a fragment of some ancient pillar for a roller, and when any part of the roof is damaged by rain or wind, they pull this roller backwards and forwards until the roof is once more solid and smooth. In summer time the inhabitants sleep on these roofs in the open air. In these districts rain does not fall either often or heavily; but when it does come down, the clothes of the people walking in the streets are terribly soiled by the mud which drips everywhere from the roofs. On a house top near our lodgings I saw a young Sanjak-bey eating his supper on a couch after the fashion of the ancients.\n \n [Text continues on about court; audience; clothing; and more.]",

My men stuffed themselves with this fish, and in consequence many of them were attacked by fever, which was caused more or less by their greediness. This great supply of fish—enough to satisfy forty men—cost half a thaler, and almost everything else at Belgrade is equally cheap. Hay fetches absolutely nothing; everyone is allowed to take as much as he likes out of the rich meadows; he is only charged for the cutting and the carrying. All this, as we crossed the Save, made us admire still more the wisdom of the ancient Hungarians in choosing Pannonia, and thus securing for themselves a land of plenty, capable of producing every kind of crop. We had travelled far, through many a land both in Europe and Asia, and in all that long journey we had seen nothing but stunted crops of grass, barley, oats, and wheat, with the very life scorched out of them by the heat; but when we entered Hungary, the grass was so high that those in the carriage behind could not see the carriage in front—a good proof of the fertility of the soil.",

Accordingly I requested our conductor to send some one forward to bring the ferry-bridge across to our bank, with a view to accelerating our passage. Although there were several reasons which rendered this plan scarcely feasible, still, partly from a wish to please me, and partly because he was anxious to announce my coming to the Sanjak-bey, he despatched a couple of men.\n [...]\n After this adventure we came to Gran, where next day the Sanjak-bey, after giving me a hearty welcome, recommended me, amongst other things, not to forget the proof I had just received of how insolent Hungarian soldiers could be, and to remember that not even the respect due to the presence of his Royal Majesty’s ambassador had kept them from playing their old tricks.

    "Description":"The departure of my colleagues took place towards the end of August 1557. In the following winter the Sultan, according to his usual custom, removed to Adrianople, with the double object of making a demonstration against Hungary and of enjoying the good hawking and the bracing climate, which he thought were beneficial to his health. At the junction of the rivers near Adrianople are wide tracts of flooded lands, on which there are great quantities of wild ducks, geese, herons, eagles, cranes, and buzzards. To capture these he generally uses a small species of eagle; these birds are trained to seek their quarry in the clouds, and bring it down, or to seize it as it flies beneath them, and with one swoop dash it to the ground. I hear he has falcons so well trained that they can bring down a crane, striking it under the wing in such a way as to keep clear of its beak, on which they would otherwise be impaled. Their boldness, however, is not always successful, for if they make the least mistake, they immediately suffer for it; the crane’s beak goes through them like an arrow, and they tumble lifeless to the ground.\n \n For the reasons I have mentioned, the Sultan makes a practice every year of repairing to Adrianople at the beginning of the winter, and of not returning to Constantinople till the frogs drive him away with their croaking.\n \n [...]\n \n I must not omit to mention that on the day of the courier’s arrival at Adrianople there was a great earthquake, _à propos_ of which he related, that he had felt an earthquake, which he considered to be the same, at Nisch and Sofia, and many other places through which he had journeyed, so that the air enclosed in the caverns of the earth seemed to have run a race with him and to have travelled almost as fast as he had ridden. In confirmation of this theory, I must tell you that a similar earthquake was felt four days later at Constantinople; here are the data and you can make your own deductions.",

We found that pepper and ginger grew here. The pepper trees are similar to the ivy, because they grow round other trees wherever they can attach themselves; their leaves resemble those of the ivy. Their bunches are of the length of half a palm or more, and as slender as a finger : the grain grows very thickly around. The reason why pepper does not grow in our region is, that we have none of the trees to plant. It is not true, as reported amongst us, that the pepper is scorched in order that it may not grow. When it is ripe and gathered in it is green, like ivy ; it is left to dry in the sun, and in five or six days it becomes black and wrinkled as we see it. For the propagation of ginger they plant a piece of a small fresh root, about the size of a small nut, which at the end of a month grows large: the leaf resembles that of the wild lily. \n \n The lord of the city is an idolater, likewise are all the people. They worship an ox, or the sun, and also various idols, which they themselves make. When these people die they are burnt: their customs and usages are various ; inasmuch as some kill all kinds of animals excepting oxen and cows: if any one were to kill or wound these, he would be himself immediately slain, because, as I have before said, they are objects of worship. Others, again, never eat flesh or fish, or anything that has had life. Every lady may take to herself seven or eight husbands, according to her inclination. The men never marry any woman who is a virgin; but if one, being a virgin, is betrothed, she is delivered over before the nuptials to some other person for fifteen or twenty days in order that she may be deflowered. In this city there are as many as a thousand houses inhabited by Christians, and the district is called Upper India.",

Here is a great lord, who possesses more than ten thousand elephants, and every year he breeds five hundred of them. \n \n This country is distant fifteen days' journey by land from another, called Ava, in which grow rubies and many other precious stones. Our wish was to go to this place, but at that time the two princes were at war, so that\n no one was allowed to go from the one place to the other. \n \n Thus we were compelled to sell the merchandise which we had in the said city of Pegu, which were of such a sort that only the lord of the city could purchase them. He is an idolator, like the before-mentioned. To him, therefore, we sold them. The price amounted to two thousand ducats, and as\n we wished to be paid we were compelled, by reason of the troubles and intrigues occasioned by the aforesaid war, to remain there a year and a half, all which time we had daily to solicit at the house of the said lord. While we were thus suffering from cold and from heat, with many fatigues and hardships, Messer Hieronimo Adorno, who was a man of feeble constitution, and greatly reduced by these afflictions combined with an ancient malady which tried him sorely, after fiftyfive days' suffering, during which he had neither physician nor medicine, yielded up his spirit to our Lord God. This was at night, on the twenty-seventh day of December, St. John's day, in the year fourteen hundred and ninety-six.\n \n Although the sacraments of the church could not be administered to him, as there was no priest among us, nevertheless, such was his patience and contrition, that I am sure, judging from the excellent life which he had always led, that our Lord God will have received his soul into paradise, and to that effect have I prayed and continually do pray. His body was buried in a certain ruined church, frequented by none; and I declare to you, that for many months I was so grieved and afflicted by his death, that it was a great chance I had not followed him ; but afterwards, considering that the grief which had taken such hold of me could bring no remedy, and being consoled by some men of worth, I exerted myself to recover our property.",

They hold the faith of the Moors, and have a chief who rules over the whole of them. \n \n There are trees growing there which produce the cocoa nuts of large size. The people live on fish, and a little rice, which they import. We were obliged to stay here six months to wait for favourable weather for our departure.",

It pleased the Lord God that I was able to lay hold of a large plank of wood, on which I floated at the mercy of the waters from morning till evening, when, as it pleased the divine mercy, three ships which had parted from our company and had been five miles in advance of us, learning our disaster, immediately sent out their boats, which came and took in those men who remained alive, of whom I was one, and we were divided amongst them according to their pleasure, and thus I arrived in one of the said ships at Cambay, the chief of which is a Mahometan, and a great lord.\n \n From this place are procured lac and indigo. Here I found some Moorish merchants of Alexandria and Damascus, by whom I was assisted with money for my expenses.",

And all are black and wicked, and the women all harlots, or witches, or thieves and cheats; and they destroy their masters with poison.\n \n The rulers and the nobles in the land of India are all Khorassanians. The Hindoos walk all on foot and walk fast. They are all naked and bare-footed, and carry a shield in one hand and a sword in the other. Some of the servants are armed with straight bows and arrows. Elephants are greatly used in battle. The men on foot are sent first, the Khorassanians being mounted in full armour, man as well as horse. Large scythes' are attached to the trunks. and tusks of the elephants, and the animals are clad in ornamental plates of steel. They carry a citadel, and in the citadel twelve men in armour with guns and arrows. ...\n \n Beder is the chief town of the whole of Mahomedan Hindostan ; the city is large, and contains a great many people.\n \n The sultan (of Beder) is a little man, twenty years old, in the power of the nobles. Khorassanians rule the country and serve in war. There is a Khorassanian Boyar, Melik-Tuchar, who keeps an army of 200,000 men ; Melik Khan keeps 100,000 ; Kharat Khan, 20,000, and many are the khans that keep 10,000 armed men. ...\n \n The land is overstocked with people ; but those in the country are very miserable, whilst the nobles are extremely opulent and delight in luxury. They are wont to be carried on their silver beds, preceded by some twenty chargers caparisoned in gold, and followed by 300 men on horseback and 500 on foot, and by horn-men, ten torchbearers and ten musicians.\n \n [...]\n \n Throughout the night the town of Beder is guarded by Beder and 1000 men kutocalories, mounted on horses in full armour, carrying each a light.\n \n I sold my stallion at Beder, and got by him 60 and 8 footoons, having kept him a whole year.

Twenty millions of people assemble at Bootkhana, but sometimes a hundred millions.\n \n At Bootkhana, Boot is sculptured in stone of an immense size, his tail rising over him. His right hand is lifted up high and extended like that of Justian (Justinian?), emperor of Constantinople ; his left holding a sword; he is quite uncovered, with only a small cloth round the loins, and has the appearance of a monkey. Some other budhs (idols) are naked, without anything on their hinder parts, and the wives of Boot and their children are also sculptured naked.\n \n A huge bull, carved in black stone and gilded, stands before Boot; people kiss his hoof and adorn him with flowers as well as Boot.",

Security and justice are so firmly established in this city, that the most wealthy merchants bring thither from maritime countries considerable cargoes, which they unload, and unhesitatingly send into the markets and the bazaars, without thinking in the meantime of any necessity of checking the account or of keeping watch over the goods.\n \n  The officers of the custom-house take upon themselves the charge of looking after the merchandise, over which they keep watch day and night. When a sale is effected, they levy a duty on the goods of one-fortieth part; if they are not sold, they make no charge on them whatsoever.\n \n  In other ports a strange practice is adopted. When a vessel sets sail for a certain point, and suddenly is driven by a decree of Divine Providence into another roadstead, the inhabitants, under the pretext that the wind has driven it there, plunder the ship. But at Calicut, every ship, whatever place it may come from, or wherever it may be bound, when it puts into this port is treated like other vessels, and has no trouble of any kind to put up with.\n \n  His majesty, the happy Khakan, had sent as a present for the prince of Calicut, some horses, some pelisses, some robes of cloth of gold, and some caps, similar to those distributed at the time of the Nauruz;. and the motive which had induced him to do so was as follows. Some ambassadors deputed by this monarch, returning from Bengal in company with the ambassadors of the latter country, having been obliged to put into Calicut, the description which they gave of the greatness and power of the Khakan reached the ears of the sovereign of that city. He learned from authentic testimony, that the kings of all the habitable globe, of the East as well as of the West, of the land and of the sea, had sent rival ambassadors and messages, showing that they regarded the august, court of that monarch as the Kiblah, to which they should pay their homage, -as the Kabah, the object to which they should direct their aspirations.\n \n [Text goes on to describe a series of cultural and social considerations in Calicut.]",

    "Description":"My reflections led me to the hope, that perhaps the morning beam of happiness was about to dawn upon me from the bosom of Divine goodness, and that the night of chagrin and weariness had nearly reached its close. Having communicated my dream to some skilful men, I asked them its interpretation. On a sudden a man arrived, who brought me the intelligence that the king of Bidjanagar, who holds a powerful empire and a mighty dominion under his sway, had sent to the Sameri a delegate charged with a letter, in which he desired that he would send on to him the ambassador of his majesty, the happy Khakan. Although the Sameri is not subject to the laws of the king of Bidjanagar, he nevertheless pays him respect, and stands extremely in fear of him ; since, if what is said is true, this latter prince has in his dominions three hundred ports, each of which is equal to Calicut, and on terra firma his territories comprise a space of three months' journey. The coast, which includes Calicut with some other neighbouring ports, and which extends as far as Kabel, a place situated opposite the Island of Serendib, otherwise called Ceylon, bears the general name of Melibar. From Calicut are vessels continually sailing for Mecca, which are for the most part laden with pepper.\n \n  The inhabitants of Calicut are adventurous sailors : they are known by the name of Tchini-betchegan (son of the Chinese), and pirates do not dare to attack the vessels of Calicut. In this harbour one may find everything that can be desired. One thing alone is forbidden, namely, to kill a cow, or to eat its flesh: whosoever should be discovered slaughtering or eating one of these animals, would be inimediately punished with death. So respected is the cow in these parts, that the inhabitants take its dung when dry and rub their foreheads with it.\n \n  The humble author of this narrative having received his audience of dismissal, departed from Calicut by sea. After having passed the port of Bendinaneh, situated on the coast of Melibar, reached the port of Mangalor, which forms the frontier of the kingdom of Bidjanagar.",

At a distance of three parasangs from Mangalor he saw a temple of idols, which has not its equal in the universe. It is an equilateral square, of about ten ghez in length, ten in breadth, and five in height. It is entirely formed of cast bronze. It has four estrades.

In it there is a temple of idols, so lofty as to be visible at a distance of many parasangs. It would be impossible to describe such a building without being suspected of exaggeration. I can only give a general idea of it. In the middle of the town is an open space, of about ten ghez in extent, and which, if one may use a comparison, rivals the garden of Irem. The roses of all kinds are as numerous as the leaves of the trees, on the borders of the streams rise a great number of cypresses, whose towering height is reflected in the waters, plantain trees shoot out their tufted branches, and it would seem as if heaven itself looks down upon this beautiful spot with pleasure and admiration. All the ground of this parterre, all the environs of this place of delight, are paved with polished stones, joined together with so much delicacy and skill, that they seem to form but one single slab of stone, and look like a fragment of the sky which might be supposed to have been brought down to the earth. In the middle of this platform rises a building composed of a cupola formed of blue stones, and terminating in a point. The stone presents three rows of figures.\n \n  What can I say of this cupola, which, as regards the delicacy of the work, offered to the world an idea of paradise ? Its vault, rounded and lofty, resembled a new moon ; its elevation vied with that of the heavens.\n \n  So great a number of pictures and figures had been drawn by the pen and the pencil, that it would be impossible, in the space of a month, to sketch it all upon damask or taffeta.\n \n  From the bottom of the building to the top there is not a hand's breadth to be found uncovered with paintings, after the manner of the Franks and the people of Khata (China). The temple consists of a structure of four estrades; this structure is thirty ghez in length, twenty in breadth, fifty in height.\n  \n \n Since that its head shot up towards the skies, that vault, previously without stones in it, now seems formed of them.\n \n  Since that its stones have rubbed themselves against the sun, the gold of that orb has taken a purer alloy.\n \n  All the other buildings, great and small, are covered with paintings and sculptures of extreme delicacy. In this temple morning and evening, after devotional exercises, which have nothing in them which can be agreeable to God, they play on musical instruments, perform concerts, and give feasts. All the inhabitants of the town have rents and pensions assigned to them on this temple. The most distant cities send hither their alms. In the opinion of these men without religion, this place is the Kabah of the Guères.",

    "YearOfTravel":1443,
    "Description":"After having sojourned in this town for the space of two or three days we continued our route, and at the end of the month of Zou'lhidjah [end of April] we arrived at the city of Bidjanagar. The king sent a numerous cortège to meet us, and appointed us a very handsome house for our residence.\n \n  The preceding details, forming a close narrative of events, have shown to readers and writers that the chances of a maritime voyage had led Abd-er-Razzak, the author of this work, to the city of Bidjanagar. He saw a place extremely large and thickly peopled, and a king possessing greatness and sovereignty to the highest degree, whose dominion extends from the frontier of Serendib to the extremities of the country of Kalbergah. From the frontiers of Bengal to the environs of Belinar (Melibar), the distance is more than a thousand parasangs. The country is for the most part well cultivated, very fertile, and contains about three hundred harbours. One sees there more than a thousand elephants, in their size resembling mountains, and in their forms resembling devils. The troops amount in number to eleven lak (1,100,000). \n \n One might seek in vain throughout the whole of Hindoostan to find a more absolute raï (king); for the monarchs of this country bear the title of raï. Next to him the Brahmins hold a rank superior to that of all other men. The book of Kalilah and Dimna, the most beautiful work existing in the Persian language, and which presents us with the stories of a raï and a Brahmin, is probably a production of the talent of the literati of this country.\n \n  The city of Bidjanagar is such that the pupil of the eye has never seen a place like it, and the ear of intelligence has never been informed that there existed anything to equal it in the world. It is built in such a manner that seven citadels and the same number of walls enclose each other. Around the first citadel are stones of the height of a man, one half of which is sunk in the ground while the other rises above it.\n \n  These are fixed one beside the other, in such a manner that no horse or foot soldier could boldly or with ease approach the citadel. If any one would wish to find what point of resemblance this fortress and rampart present with that which exists in the city of Herat, let him picture to himself that the first citadel corresponds with that which extends from the mountain of Mokhtar and Direh dou Buraderim (the Valley of the Two Brothers) as far as the banks of the river and the bridge of Malan, situated east of the town of Ghinan, and west of the village of Saïban.\n \n  It is a fortress of a round shape, built on the summit of a mountain, and constructed of stones and lime. It has very solid gates, the guards of which are constantly at their post, and examine everything with a severe inspection.\n \n  The second fortress represents the space which extends from the bridge of the new river, to the bridge of the Karav, lying to the east of the bridge of Renghineh and Djakan, and to the west of the garden of Zibendeh and of the village of Hasan.\n \n  The third citadel comprises as much space as lies between the mausoleum of the Imaum Fakhr-eddin-Râzi and the dome-shaped monument of Mohammed-Sultan-Schah.\n \n  The fourth correspends to the space which separates the bridge Andjil from the bridge of Kâred.\n \n  The fifth comprises a space equal to that which extends from the garden of Zagan to the bridge of Andjegan.\n \n  The sixth is equivalent to the space contained between the King's gate and the gate of Firouz-abad.\n \n  The seventh fortress, which is placed in the centre of the others, occupies an area ten times larger than the marketplace of the city of Herat. It is the palace which is used as the residence of the king. The distance from the gate of the first fortress, which lies on the north, to the first gate, which is situated in the south, is calculated to be two parasangs. It is the same distance from the east to the west.\n \n  The space which separates the first fortress from the second, and up to the third fortress, is filled with cultivated fields, and with houses and gardens. In the space from the third che seventh one meets a numberless crowd of people, many shops, and a bazaar. At the gate of the king's palace are four bazaars, placed opposite each other. On the north is the portico of the palace of the raï. Above each bazaar is a lofty arcade with a magnificent gallery, but the audience hall of the king's palace is elevated above all the rest. The bazaars are extremely long and broad. The rose merchants place before their shops high estrades, on each side of which they expose their flowers for sale. In this place one sees a constant succession of sweet smelling and fresh looking roses.\n \n  These people could not live without roses, and they look upon them as quite as necessary as food.\n \n  Each class of men belonging to each profession has shops contiguous the one to the other; the jewellers sell publicly in the bazaar pearls, rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. In this agreeable locality, as well as in the king's palace, one sees numerous running streams and canals formed of chiselled to stone, polished and smooth. On the left of the Sultan's portico rises the divan-khaneh (the council-house), which is extremely large and looks like a palace. In front of it is a hall, the height of which is above the stature of a man, its length thirty ghez, and its breadth ten. In it is placed the defter-khaneh (the archives), and here sit the scribes.\n  The writing of this people is of two kinds : in one they write their letters with a kalam of iron upon a leaf of the Indian nut (the cocoa-nut tree), which is two ghez in length and two fingers in breadth. These characters have no colour, and the writing lasts but a short time. In the second kind of writing they blacken a white surface, they then take a soft stone, which they cut like a kalam,' and which they use to form the letters ; this stone leaves on the black surface a white colour, which lasts a very long time, and this kind of writing is held in high estimation.\n \n  In the middle of this palace, upon an high estrade, is seated an eunuch, called Daiang, who alone presides over the divan. At the end of the hall stand tchobdar (hussars) drawn up in line. Every man who comes upon any business, passes between the tchobdar, offers a small present, prostrates himself with his face to the ground, then rising up explains the business which brought him there, and the Daiang pronounces his opinion, according to the principles of justice adopted in this kingdom, and no one thereafter is allowed to make any appeal.\n \n  When the Daiang leaves the divan they carry before him several parasols of different colours, and sound a trumpet.\n \n  On each side of him walk panegyrists, who pronounce complimentary expressions in his honour. Before reaching the king's apartment there are seven doors to be passed, each of which is guarded by a janitor. When the Daiang arrives at each door a parasol is unfolded. He passes through the seventh door alone, gives the prince an account of what matters are going on, and after the lapse of a few minutes retires. Behind the king's palace are the house and hall allotted to the Daiang. To the left of the said palace is the darab-khaneh (the mint). In this country they have three kinds of money, made of gold mixed with alloy : one called varahah weighs about one mithkal, equivalent to two dinars, kopeki ; the second, which is called pertab, is the half of the first; the third, called fanom, is equivalent in value to the tenth part of the last-mentioned coin. Of these different coins the fanom is the most useful. They cast in pure silver a coin which is the sixth of the fanom, which they call tar.\n \n  This latter is also a very useful coin in currency. A copper coin worth the third of a tar, is called djitel. According to the practice adopted in this empire, all the provinces, at a fixed period, bring their gold to the mint. If any man receive from the divan an allowance in gold, he has to be paid by the darab-khaneh. The soldiers receive their pay every four months, and no payment is ever made by a draft upon the revenues of any province.\n \n  This empire contains so great a population that it would be impossible to give an idea of it without entering into the most extensive details. In the king's palace are several cells, like basins, filled with bullion, forming one mass. All the inhabitants of this country, both those of exalted rank and of an inferior class, down to the artizans of the bazaar, wear pearls, or rings adorned with precious stones, in their ears, on their necks, on their arms, on the upper part of the hand, and on the fingers. Opposite the Divan - Khâneh (the palace of the council) is the Fil-Khâneh (the house of the elephants).\n \n  Although the king possesses a considerable number of elephants in his dominions, the largest of these animals are kept near the palace, in the interior of the first and second fortress, between the north and the west. These elephants copulate, and bring forth young. The king possesses one white elephant of an extremely great size, on whose body are scattered here and there grey spots like freckles. Every morning this animal is led out before the monarch, and the sight of him seems to act as a happy omen.\n \n [Text goes on about elephants...]\n \n  Opposite the darab-khaneh (the mint) is the house of the Governor, where are stationed twelve thousand soldiers as a guard, who receive every day a payment of twelve thousand fanom, levied on the receipts of the houses of prostitution.\n \n  The magnificence of the places of this kind, the beauty of the young girls collected therein, their allurements, and their coquetry, surpass all description. I will confine myself to the description of some particulars. Behind the darabkhaneh is a sort of bazaar, which is more than three hundred ghez in length, and more than twenty in breadth. On two sides are ranged chambers and estrades ; in front of them are erected, in the form of thrones, several platforms constructed of beautiful stones. On the two sides of the avenue formed by the chambers are represented figures of lions, panthers, tigers, and other animals. All are so well drawn, and their movements have so natural an appearance, that you would think these animals were alive. Immediately after mid-day prayer they place before the doors of the chambers, which are decorated with extreme magnificence, thrones and chairs, on which the courtezans seat themselves.\n \n  Each of these women is bedecked with pearls and gems of great value, and is dressed in costly raiment. They are extremely young, and of perfect beauty. Each one of them has by her two young slaves, who give the signal of pleasure, and have the charge of attending to everything which can contribute to amusement. Any man may enter into this locality, and select any girl that pleases him, and take his pleasure with her. Anything that he carries about with him is delivered into the keeping of those engaged in the service of the houses of prostitution ; and if anything is lost, these latter are responsible for it. \n \n Each of the seven fortresses alike contains a great number of places of prostitution, and their general proceeds amount to twelve thousand fanom, which forms the pay allotted to the guards. These latter have it assigned to them as a duty to make themselves acquainted with every event which occurs within the fortresses ; if any article is lost or stolen by thieves it is their place to report it; if not they are bound to make it good. Some slaves which had been bought by my companions, had run away. Information was given of the circumstance to the governor, who gave orders to the superintendents of the quarter in which we lived to bring back the fugitives or to make good the loss. These guards, on being informed of the value of the slaves, paid up the amount.\n \n  Such are the details which relate to the city of Bidjanagar and its sovereign.\n \n  The author of this narrative, having arrived in this city at the end of the month of Zou'lhidjah [the end of April 1443] took up his abode in an extremely lofty house, which had been assigned to him, and which resembled that which one sees in the city of Herat, over the King's gate, which gate serves as a passage for the entire population. He rested himself for several days from the fatigues of his journey. It was on the first day of Moharrem [May 1st, 1443], that I took up my abode in this great city. One day some messengers sent from the palace of the king came to seek me, and at the close of that same day I presented myself at court, and offered for the monarch's acceptance five beautiful horses, and some tokouz of damask and satin. The prince was seated in a hall, surrounded by the most imposing attributes of state. Right and left of him stood a numerous crowd of men ranged in a circle. The king was dressed in a robe of green satin, around his neck he wore a collar, composed of pearls of beautiful water and other splendid gems.\n \n [Text continues with some diplomatic moments and a description of using betel.]",

    "Description":"Abandoning myself entirely to the hope of a happy deliverance, I embarked on the eighth day of the month of Zu'lkadah [Jan. 28th, 1444] and put to sea. While the vision of those ships which float over the mountain-like waves of the sea, presented to my thoughts the traces of the Divine power, the same time, in the conversation of the companions of my voyage, I collected observations respecting remarkable names and facts worthy of note, and throughout our little company peace and contentment prevailed.\n \n  The eye of sad events and of misfortunes was gone to sleep, Fortune appeared to have given herself up to indolence, and we were surrounded with happiness.\n \n  The ship, after a million of shocks, reached the open at sea.\n \n  On a sudden there arose a violent wind on the surface of the sea, and on all sides were heard groaning and cries.\n \n  The night, the vessel, the wind, and the gulf, presented to our minds all the forebodings of a catastrophe. On a sudden, through the effect of the contrary winds, which resembled men in their drink, the wine which produced this change penetrated even to the vessel. The planks of which it was composed, and which by their conformation seemed to form a continuous line, were on the point of becoming divided like the separate letters of the alphabet. To our thoughts was strikingly presented the truth of that passage : “ The waves cover it, the billow rises beneath it, and above it is the cloud.” The sailor who, with respect to his skill in swimming, might be compared to a fish, was anxious to throw himself into the water like an anchor. The captain, although familiarized with the navigation of all the seas, shed bitter tears, and had forgotten all his science. The sails were torn, the mast was entirely bent by the shock of the wind. The different grades of passengers who inhabited this floating house threw out upon the waves riches of great value, and, after the manner of the Sofis, voluntarily stripped themselves of their worldly goods. Who could give a thought to the jeopardy in which their money and their stuffs were placed, when life itself, which is so dear to man, was in danger ? For myself, in this situation, which brought before my eyes all the threatening terrors which the ocean had in its power to present, with tears in my eyes I gave myself up for lost.\n \n  Through the effect of the stupor, and of the profound sadness to which I became a prey, I remained, like the sea, with my lips dry and my eyes moist, and resigned myself entirely to the Divine Will. At one time, through the driving of the waves, which resembled mountains, the vessel was lifted up to the skies ; at another, under the impulse of the violent winds, it descended like divers to the bottom of the waters.\n \n  The agitation of the waters of the sea caused my body to melt like salt which is dissolved in water ; the violence of the deluge annihilated and utterly dispersed the firmness which sustained me, and my mind, hitherto so strong, was like the ice which is suddenly exposed to the heat of the month of Tamouz ; even now my heart is troubled and agitated, as is the fish which is taken out of fresh water.\n \n  May the torrent of destruction overturn the edifice of fate, which thus brings in successive wares the waters of misfortune upon my head.\n \n  Many times I said to myself, and it was in language dictated by my situation that I repeated, this verse : A dismal night! the fear of the waves, and so frightful an abyss ? What judgment can they who are so peaceful on shore form of our situation ? The pure water of my life was troubled by the agitation of the sea; and the brilliant mirror of my ideas, in consequence of the dampness of the water, and the putrefaction of the air, was covered with rust. Each moment that the pupils of my eyes contemplated that muddy water, it resembled, through the effect of my extreme alarm, a flaming sword.\n \n  At the sight of the agitated sea, overset by the tempestuous winds, I drew from my breast an icy sigh ; it was a sharp weapon, which tore my very soul.\n \n  Overwhelmed at every point, and seeing the gate of hope shut on every side against me, with an eye full of tears and a heart full of burning chagrin, I addressed myself to God with the expression of this verse : Oh, our Lord, place not upon us a burden which is too heavy for our strength to bear ? I prayed to the Being, who is supremely merciful, and who never upbraideth with his benefits, to be pleased, from the immense sea of His goodness, to bedew and to bestow fresh verdure upon the little shrub of my existence; and to deign, in the distribution of the water of His kindness, to wash completely and disperse from the face of my situation the dust which rendered my life a grievance to me.\n \n  In the midst of this sad position, I reflected and put the question to myself: “ What, then, is this catastrophe, which has made fortune in her revolution fall so heavily upon me? \n \n “ What, then, is this shame, which, through the hostility of a perfidious fate, of a base and contemptible destiny, has caused the serenity of my face to disappear ? On the one side, I have been unable to snatch my precious life from the fury of the waves of death, nor have I been able, in carrying out the business of my sovereign, to bring to the surface of the water the pearl of my exertions. For a generous soul neglects nothing which can tend to the fulfilment of the obligations which it has contracted towards its benefactor, and when it becomes a question of executing the business of its master, it regards life itself, which is ordinarily so precious, as utterly valueless. If the man of sincerity casts [his loyalty to] his king into the fire of events, his nature, like that of a gem, must show no alteration in the smallest atom ;\n  or rather the gold of his loyalty, after the manner of pure gold, becomes still more refined.” I was in the midst of these reflections, and everything about me spoke of dejection and trouble, when at length, by virtue of that Divine promise: “ Who is He who hears the prayers of the afflicted, and drives away his misery ?” I on a sudden, the zephyr of God's infinite mercy began to blow upon me from that point which is indicated by these words: “ Despair not of the mercy of the Most High.” The morning of joy began to dawn from the East of happiness, and the messenger of a propitious fate brought to the ears of my soul these consolatory words: “ Since on your behalf we have divided the sea, we have saved you.” The impetuous hurricane was changed to a favourable wind, the tossing of the waves ceased, and the sea, in conformity with my desires, became completely calm. My fellow-passengers, after having celebrated at sea the feast of victims, gained sight, at the close of the month of Zu'lhidjah (middle of March, 1444) of the mountain of Kalahat, and found themselves at length in safety from all the perils of the deep. At this period, the new moon of the month of Moharrem, of the year 848 (middle of March 1444], like a beneficent spirit looked on us with a friendly eye.",

    "Description":"A CERTAIN Venetian named Nicolò, who had penetrated to the interior of India, came to pope Eugenius (he being then for the second time at Florence) for the purpose of craving absolution, inasmuch as, when, on his return from India, he had arrived at the confines of Egypt, on the Red Sea, he was compelled to renounce his faith, not so much from the fear of death to himself, as from the danger which threatened his wife and children who accompanied him. I being very desirous of his conversation (for I had heard of many things related by him which were well worth knowing), questioned him diligently, both in the meetings of learned men and at my own house, upon many matters which seemed very deserving to be committed to memory and also to writing. He discoursed learnedly and gravely concerning his journey to such remote nations, of the situation and different manners and customs of the Indians, also of their animals and trees and spices, and in what place each thing is produced. His accounts bore all the appearance of being true, and not fabrications. He went farther than any former traveller ever penetrated, so far as our records inform us. For he crossed the Ganges and travelled far beyond the island of Taprobana, a point which there is no evidence that any European had previously reached, with the exception of a commander of the fleet of Alexander the Great, and a Roman citizen in the time of Tiberius Claudius Cæsar, both of whom were driven there by tempests.",

Having learnt the Arabic language, he departed thence with his merchandise in company with six hundred other merchants (who formed what is commonly called a caravan), with whom he passed over the deserts of Arabia Petræa, and thence through Chaldæa until he arrived at the Euphrates. He says that on reaching the border of these deserts, which are situated in the midst of the province, there happened to them a very marvellous adventure; that about midnight, while they were resting, they heard a great noise, and thinking that it might be Arabs who were coming to rob them, they all got up, through fear of what might be about to happen. And while they stood thus they saw a great multitude of people on horseback, like travellers, pass in silence near their tents without offering them any molestation. Several merchants who had seen the same thing before, asserted that they were demons, who were in the habit of passing in this manner through these deserts.",

Here also cinnamon grows in great abundance. It is a tree which very much resembles our thick willows, excepting that the branches do not grow upwards, but are spread out horizontally: the leaves are very like those of the laurel, but are somewhat larger. The bark of the branches is the thinnest and best, that of the trunk of the tree is thicker and inferior in flavour. The fruit resembles the berries of the laurel : an odoriferous oil is extracted from it adapted for ointments, which are much used by the Indians. When the bark is stripped off the wood is used for fuel. In this island there is a lake, in the middle of which is a city three miles in circumference. The islands are governed by persons who are of the race of bramins, and who are reputed to be wiser than other people. The bramins are great philosophers, devoting the whole of their life to the study of astrology, and cultivating the virtues and refinements of life.",

The inhabitants are cannibals. No travellers touch here unless driven so to do by bad weather, for when taken they are torn to pieces and devoured by these cruel savages. He affirms that the island of Taprobana is six thousand miles in circumference. The men are cruel and their customs brutal.\n \n The ears both of the men and women are very large, in which they wear earrings ornamented with precious stones. Their garments are made of linen and silk, and hang down to their knees. The men marry as many wives as they please. Their houses are extremely low, in order to protect them against the excessive heat of the sun. They are all idolators. In this island pepper, larger than the pepper ordinary pepper, also long pepper, camphor, and also gold earn for the are produced in great abundance. The tree which produces gield the pepper is similar to the ivy, the seeds are green and resemble in form those of the juniper tree: they dry them in the sun, spreading a few ashes over them. In this island there also grows a green fruit, which they call duriano, of the size of a cucumber. When opened five fruits are found within, resembling oblong oranges. The taste varies, like that of cheese.",

    "Description":"This province is called Melibaria, and they collect in it ginger, called by the natives colobi, pepper, brazil wood, and cinnamon, which is known there by the name of crassa. There are also serpents without feet, six ells in length, wild, but harmless unless irritated. They are pleased with the sight of little children, and by this means are enticed into the presence of men. In the same province, and also in another called Susinaria, there is found another kind of serpent with four feet, and an oblong tail like that of large dogs, which are hunted for food. It is as harmless as kids or goats, and the flesh is prized as the best kind of food.\n \n This region also produces other serpents of a remarkable form, one cubit in length and winged like bats. They have seven heads arranged along the body, and live in trees.\n \n They are extremely rapid in flight, and the most venomous of all, destroying men by their breath alone. There are also flying cats, for they have a pellicle extending from the fore to the hinder feet and attached to the body, which is drawn up when they are at rest. They fly from tree to tree by extending their feet and shaking their wings. When pursued by hunters they fall to the earth when fatigued by flying, and so are taken. A tree grows here in great abundance, the trunk of which produces fruit resembling the pineapple, but so large as to be lifted with difficulty by one man ; the rind is green and hard, but yields nevertheless to the pressure of the finger. Within are from two hundred and fifty to three hundred apples, resembling figs, very sweet to the taste, and which are separated from each other by follicles.\n \n They have a kernel within, resembling the chesnut in hardness and flavour, flatulent, and which is cooked in the same manner as the chesnut; when thrown upon live embers, unless previously incised somewhat, it bounces up with a crackling noise. The external bark is used as provender for cattle. The fruit of this tree is sometimes found under the earth in its roots; these excel the others in flavour, and for this reason it is the custom to set these apart for royal use.\n \n This fruit has no kernel. The tree is like a large fig tree, the leaves being intercised like those of the palm : the wood is equal to boxwood, and is therefore much prized for its applicability to many purposes. The name of this tree is cachi. There is also another fruit, called amba, green and resembling very much a nut, but larger than the nectarine; the outer rind is bitter, but within it is sweet like honey: before they are ripe they steep them in water to remove the acidity, in the same manner as we are in the habit of steeping green olives.",

This mountain produces diamonds. The ingenuity of man, not having been able to find any mode of approaching the mountain, has, however, discovered a way of getting at the diamonds produced on it. There is another mountain near it, a little higher. Here, at a certain period of the year, men bring oxen, which they drive to the top, and having cut them into pieces, cast the warm and bleeding fragments upon the summit of the other mountain, by means of machines which they construct for that purpose. The diamonds stick to these pieces of flesh. Then come vultures and eagles flying to the spot, which, seizing the meat for their food, fly away with it to places where they may be safe from the serpents. To these places the men afterwards come, and collect the diamonds which have fallen from the flesh.\n \n Other stones, which are considered precious, are procured with less difficulty. They dig holes near sandy mountains in places where the stones are found, and continue their excavations unti they come to sand mixed with water. This sand they collect and wash with water, through sieves made for the purpose. The sand passes away through the sieve, and the stones, if any, are left behind : this mode of digging for stones of this description prevails universally. Great care is exercised by the masters to prevent theft by the workmen or servants,-overseers being appointed, who not only shake the clothes of the operators, but even examine every part of their persons.",

They rob travellers of their camels, food, and drink; and this is the reason why so many perish of hunger, and the number of those who succeed in reaching us so few.\n \n The Ethiopians are much longer lived than we are, for they live to be more than a hundred and twenty years old, many even reach the age of one hundred and fifty years.\n \n The whole country is extremely populous, like one which never suffers from pestilence; so that the numbers increase from the freedom from disease and the longevity of the people. Their customs also vary according to the difference hotel me of region. All however, both men and women, wear linen oblis and silken garments (for they have no wool): in some places the women wear long trains, which they bear after them fastened by girdles of the width of a palm, adorned with gold and gems. Some cover the head with pieces of cloth, interwoven with gold; some wear the hair at the back of the head flowing, others tie it up. They abound much more in gold and silver than we do; the men wear rings, the women wear armlets enriched with various precious stones. The fe period from Christmas to Lent is kept by them as a festival, being devoted to feasting and dancing. They use small tables so that two or three may eat together, using tablecloths and napkins after the European manner. They have one king, who calls himself, after God, the king of kings. They say that there are many kings subject to him.\n \n They report that they have amongst them many kinds of animals. Their cattle have a hump on the shoulder, in the manner of camels, with horns extending backwards three cubits in length, and so large that one of them can contain an amphora of wine. They have some dogs, which are as X large as our asses, and which will hunt down lions. Their elephants are large in size and very numerous.\n \n them for the purpose of display and pleasure, some as animals useful in war. They are captured when young and brought up tame, the larger ones when taken are killed. Their tusks grow to the length of six cubits. They also rear lions for display, rendering them so tame that they can be introduced into first their theatres. There is a kind of beast of various colours, very like to an elephant, excepting that it has no proboscis and that its feet resemble those of the camel : it has two horns, very sharp at the extremity, one cubit in length, one of which is situate on the forehead and the other on the nose. They have another animal called zebed, rather longer than a hare, and resembling it in other respects; possessing such a peculiar odour, that if it lean against a tree for the purpose of scratching itself, it imparts to it a smell so extremely sweet, that persons passing near shortly afterwards and guided by the scent, cut out the part against which it had supported itself, and dividing it into minute portions sell them dearer than gold. They informed me that there was also another animal, nine cubits long and six in height, with cloven hoofs like those of an ox, the body not more than a cubit in thickness, with hair very like to that of a leopard and a head resembling that of the camel, with a neck four cubits long and a hairy tail: the hairs are purchased at a high price, and worn by the women suspended from their arms, and ornamented with various sorts of gems. Another wild animal is hunted by them for food. It is as large as an ass, with stripes of a red and green colour, and has horns three cubits in length and spiral from the top. Another also, resembling a hare, has small horns, is of a red colour, and can surpass a horse in leaping. There is yet another, similar to a goat, with horns more than two cubits in length extending over the back, which are sold for more than forty gold pieces, because their smoke is beneficial in cases of fever. Another, like the last, without horns but with red hair, and the neck more than two cubits in length. They also mentioned another of the size of a camel and of the colour of the leopard, with a neck six cubits in length, and having a head like that of a roebuck. To these they added an account of a bird standing six cubits in height from the ground, with slender legs, feet resembling those of a goose, the neck and head small, and the beak like that of a hen. It flies but little, but in running surpasses the swiftness of the horse.",

    "Description":"When we passed Porto Santo, and the Desertas, and anchored in Funchal roads, I was disappointed at the calmness of my own feelings, looking at these distant islands with as little emotion as if I had passed a headland in the channel. Well do I remember, when I first saw Funchal twelve years ago, the joyous eagerness with which I feasted my eyes upon the first foreign country I had ever approached, the curiosity to see every stone and tree of the new land, which kept my spirits in a kind of happy fever.\n  \"Sweet Memory, wafted by thy gentle gale,\n  Oft up the stream of time I turn my sail,\n  To view the fairy haunts of long lost hours,\n  Blest with far greener shades, far fresher flow'rs.\" Rogers.\n Now I look on them tamely, or at best only as parts of the lovely landscape, which, just at sunset, the time we anchored, was particularly beautiful. Surely the few years added to my age have not done this? May I not rather hope, that having seen lands whose monuments are all history, and whose associations are all poetry, I have a higher taste, and more discriminating eye? One object never palls—that ocean where the Almighty \"Glasses himself in tempests,\" or over which the gentle wings of peace seem to brood. The feeling that there was a change, however, either in the scene or in me, was so strong, that I ran to my cabin and sought out a sketch I had made in 1809. I compared it with the town. Every point of the hill, every house was the same, and again Nossa Senhora da Monte, with her brilliant white towers shining from on high through the evening cloud, seemed to sanctify the scene, while a few rough voices from the shore and the neighbouring ships chaunted the Ave Maria.\n \n Early in the morning of the 19th, we took a large party of the midshipmen on shore to enjoy the young pleasure of walking on a foreign land. To them it was new to see the palm, the cypress, and the yucca, together with the maize, banana, and sugar-cane, surrounded by vineyards, while the pine and chesnut clothe the hills. We mounted the boys on mules, and rode up to the little parish church, generally mistaken for a convent, called Nossa Senhora da Monte. My maid and I went in a bad sort of palankeen, though convenient for these roads, which are the worst I have seen; however, the view made up for the difficulty of getting to it. The sea with the Desertas bounded the prospect: below us lay the roadstead and shipping, the town and gardens, and the hill clothed with vineyards and trees of every climate, which deck the ashy tufa, or compact basalt of which the whole island seems to be composed. Purchas, who like Bowles, believes the story of the discovery of Madeira by the Englishman Masham and his dying mistress, says, that shortly after that event, the woods having taken fire burned so fiercely, that the inhabitants were forced out to sea to escape from the flames. The woods, however, are again pretty thick, and some inferior mahogany among it is used for furniture. The pine is too soft for most purposes. In the gardens we found a large blue hydrangea very common: the fuschia is the usual hedge. Mixed with that splendid shrub, aloes, prickly pear, euphorbia, and cactus, serve for the coarser fences; and these strange vegetables, together with innumerable lizards and insects, tell us we are nearing the tropics.\n \n We spent a very happy day at the hospitable country house of Mr. Wardrope, and our cavalcade to the town at night was delightful. The boys, mounted as before, together with several gentlemen who had joined us at Mr. W.'s, enjoyed the novelty of riding home by torch-light; and as we wound down the hill, the voices of the muleteers answering each other, or encouraging their beasts with a kind of rude song, completed the scene. The evening was fine, and the star-light lovely: we embarked in two shore boats at the custom-house gate, and, after being duly hailed by the guard-boat, a strange machine mounting one old rusty 6 lb. carronade, we reached the ship in very good time.\n \n [Decripton of some religous buildings - have individual entries.]\n \n Of late years superstition has been used as an instrument of no small power in revolutions of every kind. Even here it has played its part. A small chapel, dedicated to St. Sebastian, had been removed by the Portuguese government in order to erect a market-place, where all articles of daily consumption were to be sold, a small tax being levied on the holders of stands. This innovation was of course disagreeable to the people, and on the night of the revolution, in November last, some of their leading orators accused the market-place of having, by rudely thrusting out St. Sebastian, occasioned the failure of the vineyards, and threatened the ruin of the island. The market-place was instantly devoted; it was down in a few seconds, and a chapel to St. Sebastian begun. Men, women, and children worked all night, and the walls were raised to at least two-thirds of the intended height; but day brought weariness, and perhaps the morning breeze chilled the fever of enthusiasm. The voluntary labourers worked no more, and no subscription adequate to the hire of workmen to complete it has yet been raised: so that the new St. Sebastian's stands roofless, and the officiating priest performs his masses with no other canopy than the heavens.\n \n [Text continues about revolution.]",

Though the humorous songs were applauded sufficiently, yet the plaintive and pathetic seemed the favourites; and the chorus to the Death of Wolfe was swelled by many voices. Oh, who shall say that fame is not a real good! It is twice blessed—it blesses him who earns, and those who give, to parody the words of Shakspeare. Here, on the wide ocean, far from the land of Wolfe's birth, and that of his gallant death, his story was raising and swelling the hearts of rough men, and exciting love of country and of glory by the very sound of his name. Well may he be called a benefactor to his country who, by increasing the list of patriotic sailors' songs, has fostered those feelings and energies which have placed Britain's \"home upon the mountain wave, and her march upon the deep.\"\n \n The charms of night in a southern climate have been dwelt upon by travelled poets (for I call Madame de Stael's writings poetry), and even travelled prose writers; but Lord Byron alone has sketched with knowledge and with love, the moonlight scenery of a frigate in full sail. The life of a seaman is the essence of poetry; change, new combinations, danger, situations from almost deathlike calm, to the maddest combinations of horror—every romantic feeling called forth, and every power of heart and intellect exercised. Man, weak as he is, baffling the elements, and again seeing that miracle of his invention, the tall ship he sails in, tossed to and fro, like the lightest feather from the seabird's wing—while he can do nothing but resign himself to the will of Him who alone can stay the proud waves, and on whom heart, intellect, and feeling, all depend!",

    "Description":"26th.—- I went ashore with Mr. Dance, the second lieutenant, and two of the young midshipmen, for the purpose of riding to the Villa di Oratava, which is situated where the ancient Guanche capital stood. We landed at the Puerto di Oratava, several miles from the villa: it is defended by some small batteries, at one of which is the very difficult landing-place, sheltered by a low reef of rocks that runs far out, and occasions a heavy surf. I took my own saddle ashore: and being mounted on a fine mule, we all began our journey towards the hill. The road is rough, but has evidently once been made with some pains, and paved with blocks of porous lava; but the winter rains have long ago destroyed it, and it does not seem to be any body's business to put it in repair.\n \n The first quarter of a mile on either hand presented a scene so black and stony, that I was surprised to learn that we had been passing through corn land; the harvest was over, and the stubble burned on the ground. The produce here is scanty; but being so near the port, it repays the labour and expense of cultivation. We saw the botanical garden so much praised by Humboldt; but it is in sad disorder, having been for some time entirely neglected. However, the very establishment of such a thing brings in new plants, and perhaps naturalises them. Here, the sago-palm, platanus, and tamarind, as well as the flowers and vegetables of the north of Europe, flourish so well as to promise to add permanently to the riches of this rich island. As we ascended towards the villa the prospect improved; the vineyards appeared in greatest beauty, every other crop still standing in the luxuriant valleys, the rocky cliffs of the mountains clothed with wood, and every thing glowing with life. Wheat, barley, a few oats, maize, potatoes, and caravansas, all grow freely here. The food of the common people consists chiefly of Polenta, or maize flour, used nearly as the Scotch peasants use their oatmeal, in cakes, brose, or porridge, which last is suffered to grow cold, and then most commonly cut in slices and toasted. After the maize, potatoes are the favourite food, together with salt fish. The potatoe is always in season, being planted every month, and consequently producing a monthly crop. The fishery employs from forty-five to fifty vessels of from seventy to ninety tons' burden, from the island of Teneriffe alone; the fish are taken on the coast of Africa, and salted here.\n \n To a stranger the sight of the long walls of black porous lava, built terrace-wise to support the vegetable mould, is very striking; but the walls cannot be called ugly, while the clustering vine and broad-spreading gourd, climb and find support on them: these, however, soon disappeared, and were replaced by field and garden enclosures. After a pleasant but hot ride, we arrived at the villa about noon, and went to the house of Señor Don Antonio de Monteverde, who accompanied us to M. Franqui's garden, to see one of the wonders of the island, the famous Dragon Tree. Humboldt has celebrated this tree in its vigour; it is now a noble ruin. In July, 1819, one half of its enormous crown fell: the wound is plaistered up, the date of the misfortune marked on it, and as much care is taken of the venerable vegetable as will ensure it for at least another century. I sat down to make a sketch of it; and while I was drawing, learned from Mr. Galway the following history of the family of its owner, which a little skill in language and a little adorning with sentiment might convert into a modern novel.—About the year 1760, the Marquis Franqui, upon some disgust, made over his estates in trust to his brother, and emigrated to France, where he remained until 1810, regularly receiving the proceeds from his estates in Teneriffe. Meantime, during the early period of the revolution, he married; and his only child, a daughter, was born. This marriage, however, was only a civil contract, such being then the law of France, and with a woman divorced from another, who was still living. But neither the validity of the union nor the legitimacy of the child was ever questioned; and the Marquis Franqui returning to his native country, brought with him his daughter, introducing and treating her as his heiress. She appeared to be received as such by his family; and at his death he appointed trustworthy guardians to her and her estates, one of whom is her husband's father. No sooner, however, was the Marquis dead, than his brother claimed his property, alleging that the church had never sanctioned the Marquis's marriage, and that the daughter consequently, as an illegitimate child, could have no claim on his estates. He therefore commenced a lawsuit against her and her guardians, and the suit is still pending. Meantime the court receives the rents; the garden, the chief ornament of the town, is running wild, and the house is deserted.\n \n The dragon tree is the slowest of growth among vegetables; it seems also to be slowest in decay. In the 15th century, that of Oratava had attained the height and size which it boasted till 1819. It may have been in its prime for centuries before; and scarcely less than a thousand years must have elapsed, before it attained its full size. Excepting the dragon trees at Madeira, the only many-headed palm I had seen before was that at Mazagong in Bombay. It is crowned, however, with a leaf like that of the palmetto; but the tufts of the dragon tree resemble the yucca in growth. The palm tree at Mazagong, like the adansonia in Salsette, is reported to have been carried thither by a pilgrim from Africa, probably from Upper Egypt, where late travellers mention this palm.\n \n [Text continues to describe \"recent law passed by the Spanish Cortes for the suppression of religious houses\" and printing presses.]\n \n We returned to the port by a longer road than that by which we left it. In the hedges, the boys, with no small delight, gathered fine ripe black-berries, which were growing among prickly pear and other tropical plants. ... [Description of local celebration.]\n \n Halfway down the hill, we entered a ravine, the dry bed of a winter torrent, where there were rue, lavender, prickly pear, hypericum, and spurge; but not a blade of grass had survived the summer's drought. We passed a heap of black ashes, which anywhere but at the base of the peak would be called a respectable mountain. It has not been cold long enough to be disguised by vegetation; and though on one side the vine is beginning to clothe its rugged surface, yet the greater part is frightfully barren.

Purchas complains that he could not obtain the reading of some travels by an Englishman who had visited the Peak; the good pilgrim's curiosity had been strongly excited by the particulars he had learnt from books, and the journals of some of his friends who had travelled, which he has carefully related: they are such as to make me regret that he has not recorded more, and that I cannot see more. We brought with us from Oratava one of the finest goats I ever saw; I presume she was a descendant of the original flock which the supreme deity of the Guanches created to be the property of the kings alone: she is brown, with very long twisted horns, a very remarkable white beard, and the largest udder I ever saw.",

    "Description":"Sept. 1st. The flying-fish are become very numerous, and whole fleets of medusæ have passed us; some we have picked up, besides a very beautiful purple sea-snail. This fish has four horns, like a snail, the shell is very beautifully tinted with purple, and there is a spongy substance attached to the fish which I thought assisted it to swim: it is larger in bulk than the whole fish. One of them gave out fully a quarter of an ounce of purple fluid from the lower part of the fish. A fine yellow locust and a swallow flew on board; and as we believe ourselves to be four hundred miles from the nearest land, Cape Blanco, we cannot enough admire the structure of the wings that have borne them so far.\n \n Our school for the ship's boys is now fairly established, and does Mr. Hyslop, our school-master, great credit; that for the midshipmen is going on very well, being kept in the fore-cabin under the captain's eye. The boys have his presence, not only as a check to idleness or noise, but as an encouragement to industry. He is most anxious to make them fit to be officers and seamen in their profession, and good men and gentlemen both at sea and on shore. Happily they are all promising; but if G—— should disappoint us, I never will believe in youthful talent, industry, or goodness more. Our days pass swiftly, because busily. The regular business of the ship, the school, astronomical observations, study of history and modern languages, and nothing permitted to pass without observation, fill our time completely.\n \n Lord Bacon says, \"It is a strange thing that in sea voyages, where there is nothing to be seen but sky and sea, men should make diaries; but in land travel, wherein so much is to be observed, for the most part they omit it, as if chance were fitter to be registered than observation.\" However, for once, his lordship has only seen, or perhaps only spoken, in part. Sea and sky must be observed before we can know the laws by which their great changes or chances are regulated. Observations on the works of man, as cities, courts, &c. may be omitted, for we know their authors, and can have recourse to them, their motives, and their history, whenever we please; but the great operations of nature are so above us, that we must humbly mark them, and endeavour to make their history a part of our experience, in order that we pass safely through their vicissitudes. Hence it is, that the commonest details of the early navigators, their sunrise and sunset, their daily portionings of food and water, are read with a deeper interest than the liveliest tour through civilised countries and populous cities; that Byron's passage through Chiloe continues to excite the most profound sympathy; while Moore's lively view of society and manners in France or Italy, are now seldom or languidly read. The uncertainty, the mystery of nature, keep up a perpetual curiosity; but I suspect that if we knew the progress and dependance of her operations, as well as we do those of an architect or brick-layer, the history of the building of a theatre or a dwelling-house might vie in interest with that of a sea voyage.\n \n The books we intend our boys to read are,—history, particularly that of Greece, Rome, England, and France; an outline of general history, voyages, and discoveries; some poetry, and general literature, in French and English; Delolme, with the concluding chapter of Blackstone on the history of the law and the constitution of England; and afterwards the first volume of Blackstone, Bacon's Essays, and Paley. We have only three years to work in; and as the business of their life is to learn their profession, including mathematics, algebra, nautical astronomy, theory and practice of seamanship, and duty as officers, with all the technicalities belonging to it,—this is all we dare propose.",

Mention but passing the line, and you conjure up a wide, apparently interminable, glassy dull sea: sails flapping, a solitary bird sinking with heat, or a shark rising lazily to catch a bait; or, at best, a calm warm night, with a soft moonlight silvering over the treacherous deep, and rendering the beholders, who ought to be lovers if they are not, insensible of the rocks that may lurk below.—But our's was not the beau idéal of crossing the line: we had fresh breezes in the day, and thunder and lightning at night; saw few tropic birds, and those very vigorous, and fish more nimble than sharks, or even sun-fish, of which, however, we met a due proportion. I had once been in a tropical calm, and I really, after trying them both, prefer the breezes and thunder-storms. The other night we had one, such as Milton talks of:\n  \"Either tropic now\n  'Gan thunder, and both ends of heav'n: the clouds\n  From many a horrid rift abortive poured \n  Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire\n  In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds\n  Within their stoney caves, but rush'd abroad\n  From the four hinges of the world, and fell\n  On the vext wilderness.\"\n I never see a thunder-storm at sea, but it reminds me of the vision of Ezekiel:\n  \"The sapphire blaze,\n  Where angels tremble while they gaze.\"\n It is awful and grand every where: fearful in the plain, sublime among the mountains; but here, on the ocean, with nothing to intercept its bolt, the horrible is superadded, and he must be more or less than man that does not at least take thought during its continuance.",

    "Description":"Pernambuco, September 22. 1821.—At nine o'clock the commodore of this place, whose office is a combination of port-admiral and commissioner, came on board with the harbour-master, and the ship was guided by the latter to the anchorage, which is about three miles from the town, in eight fathoms water. The roadstead is quite open, and we find here a very heavy swell. It is not wonderful that our guns were neither answered nor noticed last night. Mr. Dance, having been sent on shore with official letters to the governor and the acting English consul, found the place in a state of siege, and brought back with him Colonel Patronhe, the governor's aide-de-camp, who gave us the following account of the present state of Pernambuco:\n \n Besides the disposition to revolution, which we were aware had long existed in every part of Brazil, there was, also, a jealousy between the Portuguese and Brazilians, which recent events had increased in no small degree. On the 29th of August, about 600 men of the militia and other native forces had taken possession of the Villa of Goyana, one of the principal places in this captaincy, and had forcibly entered the town-house, where they had declared the government of Luiz do Rego to be at an end. They proceeded to elect a temporary provisional government for Goyana, to act until the capital of the province should be in a condition to establish a constitutional junta; and in order to accelerate that event, they had collected forces of every kind, and among them several companies of the Caçadores who had deserted from Luiz do Rego; with these troops, such as they are, they had marched towards Pernambuco, and last night they had attacked the two main points of Olinda, to the north, in four different places, and Affogados to the south. They were, however, repulsed by the royal troops, under the governor, with the loss of fourteen killed and thirty-five prisoners, while the royalists had two killed, and seven wounded. This morning the alarm of the town's people was increased by finding several armed men concealed in the belfreys of the churches, whither also they had conveyed several stands of arms. Luiz do Rego is a soldier, and attached to the royal cause. He served long with the English army in Portugal and Spain, and, if I mistake not, distinguished himself at the siege of St. Sebastian's. He is rather a severe man, and, especially among the soldiers, more feared than loved.—Great part of the regiment of Caçadores has left him to join the patriots, and formed the most efficient corps in the attack last night. The towns-people have been formed into a militia, tolerably armed and trained. The town is pretty well supplied with mandioc flour, jerked beef, and salt fish; but the besiegers prevent all fresh provisions from coming in. All shops are shut, and all food scarce and dear. Most people who have property of value, in plate or jewels, have packed it up, and lodged it in the houses of the English merchants. Many persons with their wives and families have left their homes in the out-skirts of the town, and have taken refuge with the English. The latter, who, for the most part, sleep, at least, in country houses in the neighbourhood, called sitios, have left them, and remain altogether at their counting-houses in the port: every thing, in short, is alarm and uncertainty.",

    "Description":"Monday the 24th … The name of Pernambuco, which is that of the captainship, is now generally applied to the capital, which consists of two parts; 1st, the city of Olinda, which was founded by the Portuguese, under Duarte Coelho Pedreiro, about 1530 or 1540, and, as its name implies, on a beautiful spot, where moderate, but abrupt hills, a fine river, and thick wood, combine to charm the eye; but the approach to it by sea must always have been difficult, if not dangerous: and, 2nd, the town of Recife de Pernambuco, or the Reef of Pernambuco, built by the Dutch, under Maurice of Nassau, and by them called Maurice Town. It is a singular spot, well fitted for trade; it is situated upon several sand banks, divided by salt water creeks and the mouth of two fresh water rivers, connected by three bridges, and divided into as many parts; Recife, properly so called, where are the castles of defence, and the dock-yard, and the traders; Sant Antonio, where are the government house, the two principal churches, one for the white and one for the black population; and Boa Vista, where the richer merchants, or more idle inhabitants, live among their gardens, and where convents, churches, and the bishop's palace, give an air of importance to the very neat town around them.\n \n All this I knew before I landed, and thought I was pretty well prepared for Pernambuco. But no previous knowledge could do away the wonder with which one must enter that very extraordinary port. From the ship, which is anchored three miles from the town, we see that vessels lie within a reef on which the sea is perpetually breaking, but till I was actually within that reef, I had not the least idea of the nature of the harbour: the swell going ashore would have seemed tremendous, had we not been prepared for it, and made our passage of three miles a very long one. We approached the sandy beach between Recife and Olinda so nearly, that I thought we were going to land there; when coming abreast of a tower on a rock, where the sea was breaking violently, we turned short round, and found ourselves within a marvellous natural break-water, heard the surf dashing without, and saw the spray, but we ourselves were sailing along smoothly and calmly, as if in a mill-pond. The rock of which the reef is formed, is said to be coral; but it is so coated with barnacle and limpet above barnacle and limpet, that I can see nothing but the remainder of these shells for many feet down, and as deep into the rock as our hammers will break. It extends from a good way to the northward of Paraiba to Olinda, where it sinks under water, and then rises abruptly at Recife, and runs on to Cape St. Augustine, where it is interrupted by the bold granite head, that shoots through it into the ocean: it then reappears, and continues, interruptedly, towards the south. The breadth of the harbour here between the reef and the main land varies from a few fathoms to three quarters of a mile; the water is deep close to the rock, and there the vessels often moor. There is a bar at the entrance of the harbour, over which there is, in ordinary tides, sixteen feet water, so that ships of considerable burden lie here. His Majesty's brig Alacrity lay some time within the reef; and two feet more water on the bar, would have enabled the Doris to have entered, though, as far as I have seen, there would be no room to turn about if she wished to go out again. The reef is certainly one of the wonders of the world; it is scarcely sixteen feet broad at top. It slopes off more rapidly than the Plymouth break-water, to a great depth on the outside, and is perpendicular within, to many fathoms. Here and there, a few inequalities at the top must formerly have annoyed the harbour in high tides or strong winds, but Count Maurice remedied this, by laying huge blocks of granite into the faulty places, and has thus rendered the top level, and the harbour safe at all times. The Count had intended to build warehouses along the reef, but his removal from the government prevented his doing so. A small fort near the entrance defends it, and indeed always must, so narrow and sudden is the passage. Near it, a light-house is in a fair way of being soon finished, at the very extremity of the reef, and these are the only two buildings on this extraordinary line of rock. We rowed up the harbour among vessels of all nations, with the town on one side, and the reef on the other, until we came to one of the wide creeks, over which the Dutch built a fine stone bridge, now in decay. We were a a good deal struck with the beauty of the scene; the buildings are pretty large, and white; the land low and sandy, spotted with bright green tufts of grass, and adorned with palm-trees. A few years ago a violent flood nearly destroyed the greater part of the centre of the bridge, yet the arches still serve to support light wooden galleries on each side of it, and the houses and gateways are still standing at either end. We landed pretty near the bridge, and were received by Colonel Patronhe, who apologised for the governor, who could not come to receive us, as he was in the council room.[44] The colonel conducted us to the government house, a very handsome building, with a square in front, and a tower, and we entered what had evidently been a splendid hall. The gilding and painting still remained on some parts of the ceiling and walls; but now it is occupied by horses standing ready saddled; soldiers armed, and ready to mount at a moment's warning; every thing on the alert; guns in front with lighted matches by them, and an air of bustle and importance among the soldiers, that excites a sort of sympathetic curiosity as to their possible and immediate destination. On going up stairs we found almost as much confusion: for the governor has hitherto lived in the very out-skirts of the town, and has but just come to the house in Sant Antonio, which was formerly the Jesuits' college, partly to be in the centre of business, and partly to secure his family, in case of accident, as the besiegers' out-posts are very near his former residence.\n \n [Description of familial visit.]\n \n Having paid our visit, we proceeded to walk about the town. The streets are paved partly with blueish pebbles from the beach, partly with red or grey granite. The houses are three or four stories high, built of a whitish stone, and all are white-washed, with door-posts and window-frames of brown stone. The ground floor consists of shops, or lodging for the negroes, and stables: the floor above is generally appropriated to counting-houses and ware-rooms; and the dwelling-house still higher, the kitchen being universally at the top, by which means the lower part of the house is kept cool, I was surprised to find it so possible to walk out without inconvenience from the heat, so near the equator; but the constant sea-breeze, which sets in here every day at ten o'clock, preserves a temperature, under which it is at all times possible to take exercise. The hot time of day is from eight, when the land breeze fails, to ten. As we were to pass the stone bridge on our way back to the boat, which was ordered to meet us at the point of Recife, because the receding tide would have left it dry in the creek where we landed; we left it on one hand, and walked through Sant Antonio towards Boa Vista. When we came to the wooden bridge, 350 paces long, connecting it with Sant Antonio, we found that it had been cut through the middle, and is only now passable by means of two planks easily withdrawn, in case the besiegers should get possession of Boa Vista. Nothing can be prettier of its kind than the fresh green landscape, with its broad river winding through it, which is seen on each hand from the bridge, and the white buildings of the treasury and mint, the convents, and private houses, most of which have gardens. The verdure is delightful to an English eye; and I doubt not that the flat meadows, and slowly-flowing water, were particularly attractive to the Dutch founders of Recife. We walked back by the stone bridge, 280 paces long, as we intended; in vain did we look for shops; not one was open, the shopkeepers being all on military duty. They form the militia, and, as many of them are from Europe, and as they all expect to be plundered should the country Brazilians take the town by force, they are most zealous in their attendance as soldiers.\n \n At each end of every street we found a light gun, and at the heads of the bridges two, with lighted matches by them, and at each post we were challenged by the guard. At the end of the stone bridge, at the ponte dos tres pontes[46], next to Recife, the guards are more numerous and strict. In this quarter, the chief riches of the place are lodged, and that is the point most easily defended. It is very nearly surrounded with water, the houses are high, strongly built, and close together, the streets being very narrow, and the strong gateways at each end of the bridge might secure time to demolish it entirely, and thus render that part of the town secure, except by the sand bank communicating with Olinda, and that is guarded by two considerable forts.\n \n We had hardly gone fifty paces into Recife, when we were absolutely sickened by the first sight of a slave-market. It was the first time either the boys or I had been in a slave-country; and, however strong and poignant the feelings may be at home, when imagination pictures slavery, they are nothing compared to the staggering sight of a slave-market. It was thinly stocked, owing to the circumstances of the town; which cause most of the owners of new slaves to keep them closely shut up in the depôts. Yet about fifty young creatures, boys and girls, with all the appearance of disease and famine consequent upon scanty food and long confinement in unwholesome places, were sitting and lying about among the filthiest animals in the streets. The sight sent us home to the ship with the heart-ache: and resolution, \"not loud but deep,\" that nothing in our power should be considered too little, or too great, that can tend to abolish or to alleviate slavery.",

    "Description":"Olinda is placed on a few small hills, whose sides are in some directions broken down, so as to present the most abrupt and picturesque rock-scenery. These are embosomed in dark woods that seem coeval with the land itself: tufts of slender palms, here and there the broad head of an ancient mango, or the gigantic arms of the wide spreading silk-cotton tree, rise from out the rest in the near ground, and break the line of forest: amidst these, the convents, the cathedral, the bishop's palace, and the churches of noble, though not elegant architecture, are placed in stations which a Claude or a Poussin might have chosen for them; some stand on the steep sides of rocks, some on lawns that slope gently to the sea-shore: their colour is grey or pale yellow, with reddish tiles, except here and there where a dome is adorned with porcelain tiles of white and blue. Just as we reached the highest point of the town, looking across the woody bason round which the hills are grouped, the smoke from one of the out-posts caught our sight. The soldiers were standing or lying around, and their arms piled by them: they were just shadowed by tall trees behind, between whose trunks the scattered rays of the setting sun shed such a partial light as Salvator Rosa himself would not have disdained. These same soldiers, however, circumscribed our ride: we had intended to return by the inland road, but were not allowed to pass into it, as part, at least, lies without the posts, therefore we were obliged to return by the way we came.\n \n At the spot where the present guard is placed, and where indeed a strong guard is peculiarly necessary, the river Bibiriba falls into the æstuary, which was formerly the port of Olinda. A dam is built across with flood-gates which are occasionally opened; and on the dam there is a very pretty open arcade, where the neighbouring inhabitants were accustomed in peaceable times to go in the evening, and eat, drink, and dance. It is from this dam that all the good water used in Recife is daily conveyed in water-canoes, which come under the dam called the Varadouro, and are filled from twenty-three pipes, led so as to fill the canoes at once, without farther trouble. We saw seven-and-twenty of these little boats laden, paddle down the creek with the tide towards the town. A single oar used rather as rudder than paddle guides the tank to the middle of the stream, where it floats to its destination.",

At the edge of the swamp there is a wooden palisade, where we left the last post of the royalists, and took leave of our friends, who had accompanied us so far. After riding across the marsh, which by the by is very fit for rice ground, and is surrounded by cocoa-nut and tamarind trees, we came to the main stream of the Capabaribe, a deep, broad, and very rapid river; its sides are steep, and the water beautifully clear[53]: its banks are studded with country-houses, and adorned with groves and gardens, for the present abandoned by their owners, who have taken refuge in Recife.\n \n The hedges on each side of the road are woven of palm-leaves, and where not quite new, are covered with all splendid creeping plants; the common and winged passion-flower, white, blue, and yellow clematis, jasmine, china-rose, and many others, both gay and sweet. The ditches, too, were full of colour, but we rode too fast to stay to collect plants; and I could only promise myself, at some future time, to gather one that appeared like a bog bean, but its colour bright purple.",

    "Description":"But our horses were awaiting us, and we left our indignation and our pity for the follies of some, and the miseries of others, to enjoy, for the first time since the posts were free, the country air. When we went to Bibiriba, soldiers stopped us to question at every turn; piles of arms, and horses ready accoutred at the door of every considerable residence, showed that military posts had taken place of the pleasures of the country-houses, and accounted for the solitariness of the roads. Now the scene is changed—the paths are crowded with negroes, young and old, in their picturesque, though gaudy dresses, with baskets of fruit, fish, and other provisions, on their heads; little carts, of which we had not before seen one, begin to appear, and the fine oxen which draw them form no bad contrast to the half-starved bullocks of the town. 'Twas a cool evening, and the sun was just low enough to gild the edges of the palms and other tall trees, which shot up with their deep black shadows into the thin pure light, making an effect, that even Titian's landscape pencil has not reached. Our ride extended to Mr. S.'s country-house, which is, I believe, on the same plan with all the others hereabouts, and which I can only compare to an Oriental bungalow; one story very commodiously laid out, a veranda surrounding it, and standing in the midst of a little paddock, part of which is garden ground, and part pasture, generally hedged with limes and roses, and shaded with fruit trees, is the general description of the country sitios about Pernambuco; the difference arising from the taste of the inhabitant, or the situation of the ground, being allowed for. The low rent of these pleasant little gardens is surprising; but it arises in great measure from the indolence and consequent poverty of the holders of original grants of land here: as long as their negroes and estates maintained them, they paid no attention to the particular parts that, being near the town, might have been at all times productive. Now, that sugar and cotton are no longer in such demand, nearly half the fazendas or factories are ruined, and such is become the indolent temper of the people, that rather than seek to redeem their estates, they will take the smallest annuity for a portion.",

    "Description":"Wednesday, 17th.—This morning, at day-break, my eyes opened on one of the finest scenes they ever beheld. A city, magnificent in appearance from the sea, is placed along the ridge and on the declivity of a very high and steep hill: the richest vegetation breaks through the white houses at intervals, and beyond the city, reaches along to the outer point of land on which the picturesque church and convent of Sant Antonio da Barre is placed. Here and there the bright red soil shows itself in harmony with the tiling of the houses. The tracery of forts, the bustle of shipping, hills melting in the distance, and the very form of the bay, with its promontories and islands, altogether finish this charming picture; then the fresh sea-breeze gives spirit to enjoy it, notwithstanding its tropical climate.\n \n Early in the day we moved our anchorage closer in-shore; and then, on the invitation of Mr. Pennell, the British consul, we went ashore to spend the day with him. We landed at the arsenal, or rather dock-yard, where there is nothing of the neatness observable in such establishments at home. The first object we saw, however, was a fine 58-gun frigate on the stocks, the model of which I hear connoisseurs praise as beautiful. There is nothing besides the new ship, and some handsome pieces of old brass cannon, worth looking at. Every thing is visibly either suspended or on the decline, and there will probably be no improvement, until the political state of Brazil is a little more settled. We find things here, though not quite so unquiet as at Pernambuco, yet tending the same way.\n \n The street into which we proceeded through the arsenal gate, forms, at this place, the breadth of the whole lower town of Bahia, and is, without any exception, the filthiest place I ever was in. It is extremely narrow, yet all the working artificers bring their benches, and tools into the street: in the interstices between them, along the walls, are fruit-sellers, venders of sausages, black-puddings, fried fish, oil and sugar cakes, negroes plaiting hats or mats, caderas, (a kind of sedan chair,) with their bearers, dogs, pigs, and poultry, without partition or distinction; and as the gutter runs in the middle of the street, every thing is thrown there from the different stalls, as well as from the windows; and there the animals live and feed! In this street are the warehouses and counting-houses of the merchants, both native and foreign. The buildings are high, but neither so handsome nor so airy as those of Pernambuco.\n \n It was raining when we landed; therefore, as the streets leading out of the filthy lower town do not admit of the use of wheeled carriages, on account of the steepness of the ascent, we hired caderas, and found them, if not comfortable, at least commodious. They consist of a cane arm-chair, with a foot-board and a canopy covered with leather; curtains, generally of moreen, with gilt bordering and lined with cotton or linen, are contrived to draw round, or open at pleasure; and the whole is slung by the top to a single pole, by which two negroes carry it at a quick pace upon their shoulders, changing occasionally from right to left.",

    "Description":"Saturday, 20th.—As the charts of this coast hitherto published are very incorrect, the captain asked permission from government to sound and survey the bay: it is refused on the ground of policy; as if it could be policy to keep hidden rocks and shoals, for one's own as well as other people's ships.\n \n I walked through the greater part of the town. The lower part extends much farther than I could see the day I landed; it contains a few churches, one of which, belonging to the monastery of A concepçaô, is very handsome, but the smell within is disgusting; the flooring is laid in squares with stone, and within each square there is a panelling of wood of about nine feet by six; under each panel is a vault, into which the dead are thrown naked, until they reach a certain number, when with a little quick-lime thrown in, the wood is fastened down, and then another square is opened, and so on in rotation. From that church, passing the arsenal gate, we went along the low street, and found it widen considerably at three quarters of a mile beyond: there are the markets, which seem to be admirably supplied, especially with fish. There also is the slave market, a sight I have not yet learned to see without shame and indignation[66]: beyond are a set of arcades, where goldsmiths, jewellers, and haberdashers display their small wares, and there are the best-looking shops; but there is a want of neatness, of that art of making things look well, that invites a buyer in England and France. One bookseller's shop, where books are extravagantly dear, exists in the low town, and one other in the ascent to the upper.\n \n The upper town is most beautifully situated on the ridge between the sea and the fresh water lake, and from its height, and the great slope of most of the streets, it is incomparably cleaner than the port. The cathedral dedicated to St. Salvador is a handsome building, and stands on one side of a square, where the palace, prison, and other public buildings are placed. The finest of these, the Jesuits' college, the marble columns of which came from Europe ready cut, is now converted into a barrack. The most useful is the hospital of Nossa Senhora da Misericordia, founded by Juan de Matinhos, whose statue in white marble, with a wig like Sir Cloudesley Shovel's in Westminster Abbey, stands at the first landing-place, and is the ugliest piece of carving I ever saw.\n \n This hospital, besides its use as a refuge for the sick, of whom there are generally about 120, maintains 50 young girls of decent parentage, to whom a suitable education is given, and a dowry of 200 crowns bestowed on them when they marry. The building of the Misericordia is a fair specimen of the style of the convents, public buildings, and more noble houses,—rather handsome than elegant. It surrounds a large area, subdivided into smaller courts; the staircase is of marble, inlaid with coloured stucco, and the sides are lined with tiles of porcelain, so as to form arabesques, often of very pretty design. This is both a cool and a cleanly lining to a wall, particularly for an hospital. The principal rooms are also decorated in the same manner; and many of the fronts and cupolas of the churches are covered with similar tiles, the effect of which is often exceedingly agreeable, when seen among the trees and plainer buildings of the city. The chapel belonging to the hospital is handsome, a little gaudy, however. The ceiling is respectably painted, and was probably the work of an amateur monk of the seventeenth century. The treatment of the sick is humane, and they are well provided with food and other necessaries; but the medical practice, though much improved of late years, is not the most enlightened.",

    "Description":"Wednesday, October 24th.—Mr. Pennell, his daughter, and a few other friends, joined us in an expedition to Itaparica, a large island that forms the western side of the Bay of All Saints. A shoal runs off from it a long way to sea, and there are reefs of coral rocks on different parts of its coast. The distance from the city to the nearest landing place on the island is five miles and a half, which our boats' crews rowed in less than two hours. We put in between two ledges of rock, to a little jetty, belonging to the fazenda or factory of Aseoli, or Filisberti, both of whom were partners in Jerome Buonaparte's commercial establishment here. There is no town on Itaparica; but there is a villa, or village, with a fort on the Punto de Itaparica, which commands the passage between it and the main land, and also the mouth of the river, on which stands Nazareth da Farinha, so called from the abundance of that article which it produces. There are also a great many fazendas, which, with their establishment of slaves and cattle, may be considered as so many hamlets. Each sugar farm, or ingenho, as the fazendas are oftener called here, has its little community of slaves around it; and in their huts something like the blessings of freedom are enjoyed, in the family ties and charities they are not forbidden to enjoy. I went into several of the huts, and found them cleaner and more comfortable than I expected; each contains four or five rooms, and each room appeared to hold a family. These out-of-door slaves, belonging to the great ingenhos, in general are better off than the slaves of masters whose condition is nearer to their own, because, \"The more the master is removed from us, in place and rank, the greater the liberty we enjoy; the less our actions are inspected and controuled; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes betwixt our own subjection, and the freedom, or even dominion of another.\" But, at best, the comforts of slaves must be precarious. Here it is not uncommon to give a slave his freedom, when he is too old or too infirm to work; that is, to turn him out of doors to beg or starve. A few days ago, as a party of gentlemen were returning from a pic nic, they found a poor negro woman lying in a dying state, by the side of the road. The English gentlemen applied to their Portuguese companions to speak to her, and comfort her, as thinking she would understand them better; but they said, \"Oh, 'tis only a black: let us ride on,\" and so they did without further notice. The poor creature, who was a dismissed slave, was carried to the English hospital, where she died in two days. Her diseases were age and hunger.[71] The slaves I saw here working in the distillery, appear thin, and I should say over-worked; but, I am told, that it is only in the distilling months that they appear so, and that at other seasons they are as fat and cheerful as those in the city, which is saying a great deal. They have a little church and burying-ground here, and as they see their little lot the lot of all, are more contented than I thought a slave could be.\n \n Sugar is the principal product of Itaparica; but the greater part of the poultry, vegetables, and fruit, consumed in Bahia, are also from the island, and lime is made here in considerable quantities from the madrepores and corals found on the beach. This island used to furnish the neighbourhood with horses. When the English fleet and army stopped here, on the way to the Cape of Good Hope, the horses for the cavalry regiments were procured here. However, there is nothing remarkable in Itaparica but its fertility; the landscape is the same in character with that of Bahia, though in humbler style; but it is fresh and green, and pleasing. After dining in a palm-grove, and walking about till we were tired, we re-embarked to return; but the tide was unfavourable; we drifted among the rocks, where Coutinho, the first founder of the colony of Bahia, was wrecked and afterwards murdered by the natives, and we were in consequence four hours in returning home.",

Lofty mountains, rocks of clustered columns, luxuriant wood, bright flowery islands, green banks, all mixed with white buildings; each little eminence crowned with its church or fort; ships at anchor or in motion; and innumerable boats flitting about in such a delicious climate,—combine to render Rio de Janeiro the most enchanting scene that imagination can conceive. We anchored first close to a small island, called Villegagnon, about two miles from the entrance of the harbour. That island, however small, was the site of the first colony founded by the Frenchman Villegagnon, under the patronage of Coligny, whom he betrayed. The admiral had intended it as a refuge for the persecuted Hugonots; but when Villegagnon had, by his means, formed the settlement, he began to persecute them also: the colony fell into decay, and became an easy conquest to Mem de Sa, the Portuguese captain-general of Brazil.\n \n We moved from this station to one more commodious nearer the town, and higher up the harbour, towards the afternoon, which soon became so rainy, that I gave up all hopes of getting ashore...\n \n [...]\n \n Monday, 17th.—By the assistance of some friends ashore, we have procured a comfortable house in one of the suburbs of Rio, called the Catete, from the name of a little river which runs through it into the sea. To this house I have brought my poor suffering midshipman, Langford; and trust that free air, moderate exercise, and a milk diet, will restore him. We have been visited by several persons, who all appear hospitable and kind, particularly the acting consul-general, Col. Cunningham, and his lady.\n \n December 18th.—I have begun house-keeping on shore. We find vegetables and poultry very good, but not cheap; fruit is very good and cheap; butcher's meat cheap, but very bad: there is a monopolist butcher, and no person may even kill an animal for his own use without permission paid for from that person; consequently, as there is no competition, he supplies the market as he pleases.[78] The beef is so bad, that it can hardly be used even for soup meat, three days out of four; and that supplied to the ships is at least as bad: mutton is scarce and bad: pork very good and fine; it is fed principally on mandioc and maize, near the town; that from a distance has the advantage of sugar cane. Fish is not so plentiful as it ought to be, considering the abundance that there is on the whole coast, but it is extremely good; oysters, prawns, and crabs are as good as in any part of the world. The wheaten bread used in Rio is chiefly made of American flour, and is, generally speaking, exceedingly good. Neither the captaincy of Rio, nor those to the north, produce wheat; but in the high lands of St. Paul's, and the Minas Geraes, and in the southern provinces, a good deal is cultivated, and with great success. The great article of food here is the mandioc meal, or farinha; it is made into thin broad cakes as a delicacy, but the usual mode of eating it is dry: when at the tables of the rich, it is used with every dish of which they eat, as we take bread; with the poor, it has every form—porridge, brose, bread; and no meal is complete without it: next to mandioc, the feijoam or dry kidney-bean, dressed in every possible way, but most frequently stewed with a small bit of pork, garlic, salt, and pimento, is the favourite food; and for dainties, from the noble to the slave, sweetmeats of every description, from the most delicate preserves and candies to the coarsest preparations of treacle, are swallowed wholesale.",

    "Description":"December 19th.—I walked by the side of Langford's horse up one of the little valleys at the foot of the Corcorado: it is called the Laranjeiros, from the numerous orange trees which grow on each side of the little stream that beautifies and fertilises it. Just at the entrance to that valley, a little green plain stretches itself on either hand, through which the rivulet runs over its stony bed, and affords a tempting spot to groups of washerwomen of all hues, though the greater number are black; and they add not a little to the picturesque effect of the scene: they generally wear a red or white handkerchief round the head; and a full-plaited mantle tied over one shoulder, and passed under the opposite arm, with a full petticoat, is a favourite dress. Some wrap a long cloth round them, like the Hindoos; and some wear an ugly European frock, with a most ungraceful sort of bib tied before them. Round the washerwoman's plain, hedges of acacia and mimosa fence the gardens of plantains, oranges, and other fruits which surround every villa; and beyond these, the coffee plantations extend far up the mountain, whose picturesque head closes the scene. The country-houses here are neither large nor magnificent; but they are decorated with verandas, and have often a handsome flight of steps up to the dwelling-house of the master, beneath which are either store-houses, or the habitations of the slaves: they have all a gateway, large and handsome, whatever the house may be; and that gateway generally leads to at least one walk where every kind of flower is cultivated. Brazil is particularly rich in splendid creeping flowers and shrubs; and these are mingled with the orange and lemon blossoms, and the jasmine and rose from the East, till the whole is one thicket of beauty and fragrance. I scarcely know whether my invalid or myself enjoyed the morning most. A few more such, and I should think all sickness must disappear.",

    "Description":"Friday, December 21st.—Mr. Hayne, one of the commissioners of the slave trade commission, and his sister, having proposed a party to see the botanic gardens, we set off soon after daylight; and drove to their house on the bay of Boto Fogo, perhaps the most beautiful spot in the neighbourhood of Rio, rich as it is in natural beauty; and its beauty is increased by the numerous and pretty country-houses which now surround it. These have all grown up since the arrival of the court from Lisbon; before that time, this lovely spot was only inhabited by a few fishermen and gipsies, with, it might be, a villa or two on the sloping banks by the fruit gardens. Beyond the bay, we drove through a beautiful lane to the Lake of Rodrigo de Freitas: it is nearly circular, and about five miles in circumference; it is surrounded by mountains and forests, except where a short sandy bar affords an occasional outlet to the sea, when the lake rises so high as to threaten inconvenience to the surrounding plantations. It is impossible to conceive any thing richer than the vegetation down to the very water's edge around the lake.\n \n We were to breakfast at the gardens, but as the weather is now hot, we resolved first to walk round them. They are laid out in convenient squares, the alleys being planted on either side with a very quick-growing nut tree, brought from Bencoolen originally, now naturalised here. The nut is as good as the filbert, and larger than the walnut, and yields abundance of oil; the leaf is about the size, and not unlike the shape, of that of the sycamore. The timber also is useful. The quick growth of this tree is unexampled among timber trees, and its height and beauty distinguish it from all others. The hedges between the compartments are of a shrub which I should have taken for myrtle, but that the leaves though firm are not fragrant. This garden was destined by the King for the cultivation of the oriental spices and fruits, and above all, of the tea plant, which he obtained, together with several families accustomed to its culture, from China. Nothing can be more thriving than the whole of the plants. The cinnamon, camphor, nutmeg, and clove, grow as well as in their native soil. The bread-fruit produces its fruit in perfection, and such of the oriental fruits as have been brought here ripen as well as in India. I particularly remarked the jumbo malacca, from India, and the longona (Euphoria Longona), a dark kind of lechee from China. I was disappointed to find no collection of the indigenous plants. However, so much has been done as to give reasonable hopes of farther improvement, when the political state of the country shall be quiet enough to permit attention to these things.\n \n The stream that waters the garden flows through a lovely valley, where the royal powder-mills are situated; but being fearful of too much exertion for Langford we put off visiting them to another day, and returned to the garden gate to breakfast. His Majesty John VI. built a small house there, with three or four rooms, to accommodate the royal party, when they visited the gardens. Our breakfast was prepared in the veranda of that house, from whence we had a charming view of the lake, with the mountains and woods,—the ocean, with three little islands that lie off the lake; and in the fore-ground a small chapel[79] and village, at the extremity of a little smooth green plain.",

    "NameOfTraveler":"Maria Graham",
    "YearOfTravel":1821,
    "Description":"After waiting with our agreeable and well-informed friends till the sea-breeze set in, we returned part of the way along the lake, and then ascended to the parsonage of Nossa Senhora da Cabeça, where we were joined by several other persons who had come to dine there with us. The Padre Manoel Gomez received us very kindly, and our pic-nic was spread in the ample veranda of his parsonage. Behind the veranda three small rooms served for sleeping-room, kitchen, and pantry. Half a dozen small cottages in the field behind contain the healthy-looking negroes who are employed in his coffee-grounds, and a swarm of children of every shade, between black and white. On a little eminence in the midst of these stands the chapel of Our Lady, which is the parish church of a large district. It is exceedingly small; but serves as the place where the sacraments are administered, and the licences granted for marriages, burials, and christenings. The owners of estates have generally private chapels, where daily mass is performed for the benefit of their own people; so that the parish church is only applied to on the above-mentioned occasions. About a stone's throw behind the chapel, a clear rivulet runs rapidly down the mountain, leaping from rock to rock, in a thousand little cascades, and forming, here and there, delightful baths. Nor is it without its inhabitants, which increase the simple luxuries of the Padre's table. He tells me the crawfish in his stream are better than any in the neighbourhood; the water itself is pure, light, and delicate.\n \n At length all our friends had assembled, and we returned to the veranda to dine. To judge by the materials of the feast, so blended were the productions of every climate that we could scarcely have pronounced in what part of the world we were, had not the profusion of ananas and plantains, compared with the small quantity of apples and peaches, reminded us of it. As is usual on such occasions, the oldest inhabitants of Brazil praised most what came from afar; while we all gave the preference to the productions of the country.\n \n I was soon drawn away from the table by the beauty of the prospect, which I endeavoured to sketch. The coffee plantations are the only cultivated grounds hereabouts; and they are so thickly set with orange trees, lemons, and other tall shrubs, that they form in appearance rather a variety in the woods, than that mixture of cultivated with wild ground, which might be looked for so near a large city, where we expect to see the labour of man encroaching in some degree on the wild beauties of nature. But here vegetation is so luxuriant, that even the pruned and grafted tree springs up like the native of the forest.\n \n As every body was determined to be pleased, we all felt sorry when it was time to separate; but Burns has made all the reflections one can make on breaking up a pleasant party—\n \"Pleasures are like poppies spread,—\n You seize the flower, the bloom is shed;\n Or like the snow-falls in the river,—\n A moment white, then lost for ever;\n Or like the rainbow's fleeting form,\n Evanishing amid the storm;\n Or like the borealis race,\n That flit ere you can point their place.\n No man can tether time or tide:\n The hour approaches,—we must ride.\"\n \n And so we did.—We walked down to the foot of the hill, and each took his or her several conveyance; Colonel and Mrs. Cunningham their comfortable English chariot, Mr. and Miss Hayne their pretty curricle, and I my Rio caleche or sege,—a commodious but ugly carriage, very heavy, but well enough adapted to the rough roads between the garden and the town. The gentlemen all rode, and most of us carried home something. Fruit and flowers attracted some; Langford got a number of diamond beetles, and a magnificent butterfly, and I a most inadequate sketch of the scene from the Padre's house.",

    "Description":"Monday, 31st Dec. 1822.—I went to town for the first time; our road lay through the suburb of the Catete for about half a mile. Some handsome houses are situated on either hand, and the spaces between are filled with shops, and small houses inhabited by the families of the shopkeepers in town. We then came to the hill called the Gloria, from the name of the church dedicated to N.S. da Gloria, on the eminence immediately overlooking the sea. The hill is green, and wooded and studded with country-houses. It is nearly insulated; and the road passes between it and another still higher, just where a most copious stream issues from an aqueduct (built, I think, by the Conde de Lavradio), and brings health and refreshment to this part of the town from the neighbouring mountains. Farther on, after passing the beach of the Gloria, we turned to the left, and entered the new part of that town through the arches of the great aqueduct built in 1718 by the viceroy Albuquerque. This supplies four copious fountains. The largest is the Carioca, near the convent of Sant Antonio; it has twelve mouths, and is most picturesque in itself: it is constantly surrounded by slaves, with their water-barrels, and by animals drinking. Just beyond are troughs of granite, where a crowd of washerwomen are constantly employed; and over against these, benches are placed, on which there are constantly seated new negroes for sale. The fountain of the Marecas is opposite to the public gardens, and near the new barracks; and, besides the spouts for water for the inhabitants, there are two troughs always full for the animals. The third is a very handsome one, in the palace square; and the fourth, called the Mouro, I did not see. The aqueduct is of brick, and is supported on two ranges of arches across the valley between two of the five hills of the city. The public buildings at Rio have nothing very remarkable about them. Even the churches present no architectural beauty, and owe the good effect they have in the general view to their size and situation. There are seven parish churches, and numerous chapels dependent on each. The first and eldest parish is that of St. Sebastian; the church dedicated to whom is the royal chapel, the only one I saw to-day. It is handsome within, richly gilt, and the pictures on the ceiling are far from contemptible; but I cannot praise that of the altar-piece, where Our Lady is covering with her cloak the Queen Dona Maria, and all the royal family, on their arrival in Brazil. The choir is served in a manner that would not disgrace Italy. I attended at vespers, and have seldom been more gratified with the music of the evening service. This the chapel owes to the residence of the royal family, whose passion and talent for music are hereditary. Adjoining to this chapel is the church and convent of the Carmelites, which forms part of the palace; and within which is the royal library of 70,000 volumes, where on all days, except holidays, the public are admitted to study from nine till one o'clock in the forenoon, and from four o'clock till sunset. This part of the palace occupies one side of a handsome square: the palace itself fills up another; a third has private houses, built uniformly with the palace, besides the fish-market; and the fourth is open to the sea. The water-edge is faced with a handsome granite pier and steps, the blocks of which are bolted with copper. In the centre of the pier there is a fountain, supplied from the aqueduct of Albuquerque; and altogether the appearance of the palace square is extremely handsome. We went thence into a street behind it, and saw the front of the senate-house, which is connected with the palace, and the cemetery of the Carmelite church, which is a prettier thing than church-yards usually are. In the centre of a small quadrangle there is a cross, and by it a young cypress tree: all around there are flowers, and sweet herbs, and porcelain vases, containing roses and aloes placed on little pedestals and on a broad low wall that surrounds the square. I looked at first in vain for graves; at length I observed on these low walls, and on the higher ones in the outer circle, indications of arches, each being numbered. These are the places for the dead, who are walled up there with quick-lime; and, at a certain period, the bones and ashes are removed to make room for others. At the time of removal, if the dead has a friend who wishes it, the remains are collected in urns or other receptacles, and placed in a building appropriated for them, or where the friend pleases; otherwise they go to the common receptacle, and perish totally by the addition of more quick-lime. This is, I doubt not, the wholesomest way of disposing of the dead; and, even to the sense, is better than the horrid burials at Bahia, where they must infect the air. But there seems to me so little feeling in thus getting rid at once of the remains of that which has once been dear to us, that I went away in disgust.",

    "Description":"The city of Rio is more like an European city than either Bahia or Pernambuco; the houses are three or four stories high, with projecting roofs, and tolerably handsome. The streets are narrow, few being wider than that of the Corso at Rome, to which one or two bear a resemblance in their general air, and especially on days of festivals, when the windows and balconies are decorated with crimson, yellow, or green damask hangings. There are two very handsome squares, besides that of the palace. One, formerly the Roça, is now that of the Constituçaõ, to which the theatre, some handsome barracks and fine houses, behind which the hills and mountains tower up on two sides, give a very noble appearance. The other, the Campo de Santa Anna, is exceedingly extensive[81], but unfinished. Two of the principal streets run across it, from the sea-side to the extremity of the new town, nearly a league, and new and wide streets are stretching out in every direction. But I was too tired with going about in the heat of the day to do more than take a cursory view of these things, and could not even persuade myself to look at the new fountain which is supplied by a new aqueduct.\n \n There is in the city an air of bustle and activity quite agreeable to our European eyes; yet the Portuguese all take their siesta after dinner. The negroes, whether free blacks or slaves, look cheerful and happy at their labour. There is such a demand for them, that they find full employment, and of course good pay, and remind one here as little as possible of their sad condition, unless, indeed, one passes the street of the Vallongo; then the slave-trade comes in all its horrors before one's eyes. On either hand are magazines of new slaves, called here peices; and there the wretched creatures are subject to all the miseries of a new negro's life, scanty diet, brutal examination, and the lash.",

    "Description":"January 8th, 1822.—The only variety in my quiet life since the first, was afforded by a large and pleasant party at Miss Hayne's. There I saw abundance of jewels on the heads and necks of the elderly Portuguese ladies, and a good deal of beauty, and some grace, among the younger ones, whom I begin to understand pretty well. We had some good music, and there was a great deal of dancing, and not a little card-playing.\n \n To-day we left the house on shore, and are again at home on board the Doris, with all our invalids much better. Having settled every body comfortably, I went ashore to the opera, as it is the benefit night of a favourite musician, Rosquellas, whose name is known on both sides of the Atlantic. The theatre is very handsome; in size and proportion, some of our officers think it as large as the Haymarket, but I differ from them. It was opened on the 12th of October, 1813, the Prince Don Pedro's birth-day. The boxes are commodious, and I hear, that the unseen part of the theatre is comfortable for the actors, dressers, &c.; but the machinery and decorations are deficient. The evening's amusements consisted of a very stupid Portuguese comedy, relieved between the acts by scenes from an opera of Rossini's by Rosquellas, after which, he wasted a great deal of fine playing on some very ugly music.\n \n [Discussion of revolution and communications with Portugal.]\n \n 11th.—I went ashore last night to the opera, as it was again a gala night, and hoped to have witnessed the reception of the Prince and Princess. The Viscondeça do Rio Seco kindly invited me to her box, which was close to theirs; but, after waiting some time, notice arrived that the Prince was so busy writing to Lisbon, that he could not come. The double guard was withdrawn, and the play went on. I had, however, the pleasure of seeing the theatre illuminated, of hearing their national hymn, and of seeing the ladies better dressed than I had yet had occasion to do.\n \n There is a great deal of uneasiness to-day. The Portuguese commander-in-chief of the troops, General Avilez, has demanded and received his discharge. It is said, perhaps untruly, that his remonstrance to the Prince against his remaining here has been ungentlemanlike and indecent. I hear the troops will not consent to his removal, and they are particularly incensed that the choice of a successor should fall on General Curado, a Brazilian, who, it is said, will be called from St. Paul's to succeed Avilez. He is a veteran, who has commanded with distinction in all the campaigns on the southern frontier, and his actions are better known among his countrymen than those distant battles in Europe, on which the Portuguese officers of every rank are apt to pride themselves here, however slight the share they had in them, to the annoyance of the Brazilians.",

    "Description":"12th.—Yesterday the military commission for the government of the army here was broke up, and Curada appointed commander-in-chief, and minister of war. The Portuguese General Avilez made his appearance at the barracks of the European soldiers to take leave of them; they were under arms to receive him, and vowed not to part with him, or to obey another commander, and were with difficulty reduced to such order as to promise tolerable tranquillity for the day at least. It is said, that as it had been understood that they had expressed some jealousy, because the guard of honour at the opera-house had been for the two last evenings composed of Brazilians, the Prince sent to the Portuguese barracks for the guard of last night, but that they refused to go; saying, that as His Royal Highness was so partial to the Brazilians, he had better continue to be guarded by them. I am not sure this is true, but from the circumstances of the day it is not improbable.\n \n The opera-house was again brilliantly lighted. The Prince and Princess were there, and had been received as well as on the ninth, when, at about eleven o'clock, the Prince was called out of his box, and informed that bodies of from twenty to thirty of the Portuguese soldiers were parading the streets, breaking windows and insulting passengers in their way from barrack to barrack, where everything wore the appearance of determined mutiny. At the same time, a report of these circumstances having reached the house, the spectators began to rise for the purpose of going home; when the Prince, having given such orders as were necessary, returned to the box, and going with the Princess, then near her confinement, to the front, he addressed the people, assured them that there was nothing serious, that he had already given orders to send the riotous soldiers, who had been quarrelling with the blacks, back to their barracks, and entreated them not to leave the theatre and increase the tumult, by their presence in the street, but remain till the end of the piece, as he meant to do, when he had no doubt all would be quiet. The coolness and presence of mind of the Prince, no doubt, preserved the city from much confusion and misery. By the time the opera was over the streets were sufficiently clear to permit every one to go home in safety.\n \n Meantime the Portuguese troops, to the number of seven hundred, had marched up to the Castle-hill, commanding the principal streets in the town, and had taken with them four pieces of artillery, and threatened to sack the town. The field-pieces belonging to the Brazilians, which had remained in the town after the 26th of February, had been sent to the usual station of the artillery, at the botanical gardens, no longer ago than last week, so they entertained no fear of artillery. But they were disappointed in their expectation of being joined by that part of the Portuguese force which was stationed at San Cristovaŏ. This amounted to about 500 men[87], who said the King had left them to attend on the person of the Prince, and they had nothing to do with anything else; a declaration that was looked on with suspicion by the Brazilians.\n \n While the Portuguese were taking up their new and threatening position, the Brazilians were not idle. Every horse and mule in the town was pressed, and expresses despatched to all the militia regiments, and other Brazilian troops, as well as to the head-quarters of the artillery. The Prince was most active; so that by four o'clock this morning (12th), he found himself at the head of a body of four thousand men, in the Campo de Santa Anna, not only ready, but eager for action; and though deficient in discipline, formidable from their numbers and determination.\n \n The Portuguese had by no means expected such promptness and decision; they had besides not taken provision to the hill, and they were convinced that it would be an easy matter to starve them, by means of the immense superiority of numbers in the Campo. They therefore prepared to obey an order which the Prince communicated to them early in the day, to remove from the city to Praya Grande, on the other side of the harbour, only conditioning to carry their arms with them. His Royal Highness wished to have put them instantly on board of transports, to be conveyed to Lisbon, but the port admiral reported that there was neither shipping nor provision ready for the purpose; and therefore they are to be quartered at Praya Grande, until such shall be provided.",

    "Description":"The weather is now excessively hot, the thermometer being seldom under 88°, and we have had it on board at 92° Fahrenheit. \n \n [...]\n \n The place we were going to is Nossa Senhora da Luz, about twelve miles from Rio, up the harbour, near the mouth of the river Guaxindiba, which river rises in the hills of Taypu; and though its straight course is only five miles, its windings would measure twenty or more: it is navigable, and its banks are astonishingly fertile.\n \n The evening was charming, and we sailed past many a smiling island and gay wooded promontory, where gardens and country-houses are thickly scattered, and whence provisions in innumerable boats and canoes cross the bay every morning for the city. Our first view of N.S. da Luz presented such a high red bank, half covered with grass and trees, overhanging the water in the evening sun, as Cuyp would have chosen for a landscape; and just as I was wishing for something to animate it, the oxen belonging to the factory came down to drink and cool themselves in the bay, and completed the scene. The cattle here are large and well-shaped, something like our own Lancashire breed, and mottled in colour, though mostly red. On doubling the point of the bank, we came upon a small white church, with some venerable trees near it; beyond that was the house, with a long veranda, supported by white columns; and still farther on, the sugar-house, and the pottery and brick-work. We landed close to the house; but as the beach is shallow and muddy, we were carried ashore by negroes. Nothing can be finer than the scenery here. From the veranda, besides the picturesque and domestic fore-ground, we see the bay, dotted with rocky islands; one of these, called Itaoca, is remarkable as having, in the opinion of the Indians, been the residence of some divine person: it is connected with the traditions concerning their benefactor, Zome, who taught them the use of the mandioc, and whom the first missionaries here contrived to convert into St. Thomas the apostle. It consists of one immense stone cleft throughout, and a little earth and sand gathered round it, on which are trees and shrubs of the freshest verdure; some of the other islets are bare, and some again have houses and villages on them: the whole scene is terminated by the Organ Mountains, whose spiry and fantastic summits attracting the passing clouds, secure an everlasting variety to the eye.",

    "Description":"May 1st.—I have this day seen the Val Longo; it is the slave-market of Rio. Almost every house in this very long street is a depôt for slaves. On passing by the doors this evening, I saw in most of them long benches placed near the walls, on which rows of young creatures were sitting, their heads shaved, their bodies emaciated, and the marks of recent itch upon their skins. In some places the poor creatures were lying on mats, evidently too sick to sit up. At one house the half-doors were shut, and a group of boys and girls, apparently not above fifteen years old, and some much under, were leaning over the hatches, and gazing into the street with wondering faces. They were evidently quite new negroes. As I approached them, it appears that something about me attracted their attention; they touched one another, to be sure that all saw me, and then chattered in their own African dialect with great eagerness. I went and stood near them, and though certainly more disposed to weep, I forced myself to smile to them, and look cheerfully, and kissed my hand to them, with all which they seemed delighted, and jumped about and danced, as if returning my civilities. Poor things! I would not, if I could, shorten their moments of glee, by awakening them to a sense of the sad things of slavery; but, if I could, I would appeal to their masters, to those who buy, and to those who sell, and implore them to think of the evils slavery brings, not only to the negroes but to themselves, not only to themselves but to their families and their posterity.\n \n After all, slaves are the worst and most expensive servants; and one proof of it is this, I think. The small patch that each is allowed to cultivate for his own use on many estates generally yields at least twice as much in proportion as the land of the master, though fewer hours of labour are bestowed upon it. I have hitherto endeavoured, without success, to procure a correct statement of the number of slaves imported into all Brazil. I fear, indeed, it will be hardly possible for me to do so, on account of the distance of some of the ports; but I will not rest till I procure at least a statement of the number entered at the custom-house here during the last two years. The number of ships from Africa that I see constantly entering the harbour, and the multitudes that throng the slave-houses in this street, convince me that the importation must be very great. The ordinary proportion of deaths on the passage is, I am told, about one in five.",

At the farthest end there is a gorge between the Corcovado mountain and the rocks belonging to what may be called the Sugar-loaf group, which leads to the Lagoa of Rodrigo Freites, through which gorge a small rivulet of fine fresh water runs to the sea. Just at its mouth, there has long been a village inhabited by gipsies, who have found their way hither, and preserve much of their peculiarity of appearance and character in this their trans-atlantic home. They conform to the religion of the country in all outward things, and belong to the parish of which the curate of Nossa Senhora da Monte is pastor; but their conformity does not appear to have influenced their moral habits. They employ their slaves in fishing, and part of their families is generally resident at their settlements; but the men rove about the country, and are the great horse-jockies of this part of Brazil. Some of them engage in trade, and many are very rich, but still they are reputed thieves and cheats; and to call a man Zingara (gipsy) is as much as to call him knave. They retain their peculiar dialect; but I have not been able, personally, to get sufficiently acquainted with them to form any judgment of the degree in which their change of country and climate may have affected their original habits.",

    "Description":"July 23d.—I had for some time promised to paint a sketch of San Cristavaŏ for the Empress, and to-day I resolved to carry it to her. So I went, and on my way breakfasted at my good friend the Viscondeça do Rio Seco's; I then proceeded to the palace, and went up first to enquire after the Emperor's health: while I was writing my name, he, having perceived me arrive from the window, politely sent to say he would see me, and accordingly I was ushered into the presence-chamber by the Viador Don Luiz da Ponte; there I saw ministers and generals all in state. The Emperor was in a small inner room, where were his piano, his shooting apparatus, &c.; he was in an undressed cotton jacket with his arm in a sling, but looking well, although thinner and paler than formerly: he sent for the little picture, with which he seemed much pleased; and after speaking for some time very politely in French, I made my courtesy and retired. I then went to the Empress's apartment: she was out, but I was asked to wait for her return from her walk; and in the meantime I saw the young Princesses, who are extremely fair, and like Her Imperial Majesty, especially the eldest, Dona Maria da Gloria, who has one of the most intelligent faces I have seen. The Empress came in soon, and talked to me a good while on a variety of subjects, and very kindly of my late illness. Setting aside the consideration of her high rank, it is not a little pleasing to me to meet so well-educated and well-bred a woman; and I felt quite sorry to leave her without telling her so: she is in all respects an amiable and respectable woman. No distressed person ever applies to her in vain; and her conduct, both public and private, justly commands the admiration and love of her family and subjects: her personal accomplishments would adorn the station of a private gentlewoman; her temper, prudence, and courage, fit her for her high situation. On my way back to town I stopped at a country-house belonging to M. do Rio Seco: it is called Rio Comprido, and is remarkable for its garden; the outer hedge of which is like a fairy bower, or rather might adorn the gardens of Armida. A fence, breast-high, of myrtle and other evergreens, is surmounted by arcades of ever-blowing roses; among which a jessamine, or a scarlet or purple creeper, twines itself occasionally, enriching the flowery cornice of the pillars between which the paths of entrance lie. The inner part one might indeed wish less stiff; but then all is kept in such order, and filled with such rich flowers and shrubs, that one knows not how the change might be made with advantage. The house is low, and pleasant for the climate; the orchard, kitchen garden, and grass fields behind, delightful; and the whole is surrounded by beautiful views. The Padre Jose, who is the chaplain, is also the overseer of the estate; a combination of offices that I find is usual here.",

Graham has had a slight attack of gout, for which reason I have not been ashore since our return from Bahia; but as he is a little better to-day he has insisted on my accompanying a party of our young men in an expedition up the harbour to see a country estate and factory.\n \n At one o'clock, our friend, Mr. N. called for us, with a large boat of the country, which is better for the purpose than our ship's boats. These vessels have a standing awning, and two very large triangular sails: they are managed according to their sizes by four, six, eight, or more negroes, besides the man at the helm: when rowing, the rowers rise at every stroke, and then throw themselves back on their seats. I think I have heard that within the memory of persons now in the navy it was the fashion to row the admiral's barges so in England. The boatmen are here universally negroes; some free, and owners of their boats; others slaves, who are obliged to take home a daily fixed sum to their masters, who often pass a life of total indolence, being fed in this way by their slaves.\n \n The place we were going to is Nossa Senhora da Luz, about twelve miles from Rio, up the harbour, near the mouth of the river Guaxindiba, which river rises in the hills of Taypu; and though its straight course is only five miles, its windings would measure twenty or more: it is navigable, and its banks are astonishingly fertile.\n \n The evening was charming, and we sailed past many a smiling island and gay wooded promontory, where gardens and country-houses are thickly scattered, and whence provisions in innumerable boats and canoes cross the bay every morning for the city.

The cold weather seems to have a good effect on our invalids. The barometer fell suddenly, and a strong S.W. wind succeeded, and we were glad to light a fire in the cabin.\n \n I am sorry we have passed so far out of sight of the Falkland Islands, Sir John Hawkins’s maiden land. The idea of seeing a town left standing as it was, by all its inhabitants at once, and of the tame animals becoming wild, had something romantic. It seemed like a realisation of the Arabian tale of the half-marble prince, and in real interest comes near the discovery of the lost Greenland settlements. I do not know any thing that gratifies the imagination, more than the situations and incidents that by bringing distant periods of time together, places them, as it were, at once within our own reach. I remember some years ago spending a whole day with no companion but my guide at Pompeii, and becoming so intimate with the ancients, their ways, and manners, that I felt, when I went home to Naples, and its lazaroni, and its English travellers, as I suppose, that one of the seven sleepers to have done, who went to purchase bread with money five centuries old. As to the marble cities of Moorish Africa, when we consider their exposure to the sirocco, and read Dolomieu's Experiments on the Atmosphere, during the prevalence of that wind at Malta, we shall find but too probable a reason for their existence as reported.",

Just as our friends in England are looking forward to spring, its gay light days and early flowers, we are sailing towards frozen regions, where avarice’ self has been forced to give up half-formed settlements by the severity of the climate. We are in the midst of a dark boisterous sea; over us, a dense, grey, cold sky. The albatross, stormy petrel, and pintado are our companions; yet there is a pleasure in stemming the apparently irresistible waves, and in wrestling thus with the elements. I forget what writer it is who observes, that the sublime and the ridiculous border on each other; I am sure they approach very nearly at sea. If I look abroad, I see the grandest and most sublime object in nature,—the ocean raging in its might, and man, in all his honour, and dignity, and powers of mind and body, wrestling with and commanding it: then I look within, round my little home in the cabin, and every roll of the ship causes accidents irresistibly ludicrous; and in spite of the inconveniences they bring with them, one cannot choose but laugh. Sometimes, in spite of all usual precautions, of cushions and clothes, the breakfast-table is suddenly stripped of half its load, which is lodged in the lee scuppers, whither the coal-scuttle and its contents had adjourned the instant before: then succeed the school-room distresses of capsized ink-stands, broken slates, torn books, and lost places; not to mention the loss of many a painful calculation, and other evils exquisite in their kind, but abundantly laughable, especially, as it happened just now, if the school-master is induced to measure his length on the deck, when in the act of reprimanding the carelessness which subjects the slates and books to these untoward chances.",

It was first taken for the signal lanterns of a large ship; then the officer of the watch thought it was a blue light, and we made no doubt of its being Sir T. Hardy in the Creole.

Pelagica, or Mother Cary's chicken, is the least; the P. Pintado is gayest on the water; but the P. Glacialis, or fulmer, is most beautiful when brought on board: I cannot enough admire the delicate beauty of the snow-white plumage, unwet and unsoiled, amid the salt waves. The poets have scandalised both the arctic and antarctic regions as\n  \"A bleak expanse,\n  Shagg'd o'er with wavy rocks, cheerless and void\n  Of ev'ry life;\"\n yet, on Capt. Parry's approach to the north pole, he found the solitude teeming with life; and the farther south we have sailed, the more life we have found on the waters. Yesterday the sea was covered with albatrosses, and four kinds of petrel: the penguin comes near us; shoals of porpoises are constantly flitting by, and whales for ever rising to the surface and blowing alongside of the ship.\n \n With the thermometer not lower than 30°, we feel the cold excessive. Yesterday morning the main rigging was cased in ice; and the ropes were so frozen after the sleet in the night, that it was difficult to work them. I never see these things but I think of Thomson's description of Sir Hugh Willoughby's attempt to discover the northwest passage, when\n  \"He with his hapless crew,\n  Each full exerted at his several task,\n  Froze into statues; to the cordage glued\n  The sailor, and the pilot to the helm.\"\n I was glad to-day, when the dead-lights were removed, to see the bright, blue, but still boisterous sea, spreading with ample waves curled with snowy tops, in the sunshine; it is many days since we have seen the sun, and the white birds flying and chattering, or wrestling on the water, while the ship, like them, sometimes bravely mounts the very top of the wave, and sometimes quietly subsides with it. These are the things we behold \"who go down to the sea in ships, \"and occupy our business in the great waters.\" No one can imagine, who has not felt, the exhilaration of spirits produced by a dry clear day of sunshine at sea, after a week of rain and snow.",

    "Description":"March 13th, 1823. On board the Col. Allen, at anchor in Rio de Janeiro.—One of the most windy and rainy days that I ever remember seeing in Brazil; so that the beautiful landscape of the harbour is entirely lost to the strangers from Chile, and I cannot get ashore either to provide lodgings for myself and my invalid, or to assist my friends in any way. When the officer of the visiting boat came on board, the captain of the ship showed him into the cabin, and left him with me. I found he spoke English, and immediately began to enquire of him concerning the news of Rio. And first he mentioned the coronation of the Emperor, and then the war at Bahia; on which I questioned him very closely, on the ground of having formerly visited the place. It appears that last night only His Imperial Majesty's ships Unaŏ, (now Piranga,) Nitherohy, and Liberal, with a fleet of transports, had returned from Alagoas, where they had landed reinforcements for General Labatu; whose head-quarters are at Cachoeira, and who is investing the city of Bahia closely. General Madeira has a strong force of Portuguese soldiers, besides 2000 seamen which occasionally do duty ashore, and a considerable naval force.[100] But it appears, that the seamen are on the point of mutining for want of pay. Having told me so much, the officer began to question me in my turn,—Did I come from Chile? Did I know Lord Cochrane? was he coming to Rio? for all eyes were turned towards him. When he found that His Lordship was actually on board, he flew to his cabin door, and entreated to kiss his hands; then snatched his hat, and calling to the captain to do as he would, and anchor where he pleased without ceremony, jumped over the side to be the first, if possible, to convey to the Emperor the joyful intelligence. Nearly the same scene was acted over when Perez, the port-captain, came on board; and in a few minutes Captain Garçaŏ of the Liberal came to pay his respects, and shortly afterwards Captain Taylor of the Nitherohy, from whom we learned something more of the state of His Imperial Majesty's fleet. The Pedro Primeiro, formerly the Martim Freitas, had been left by the King in want of thorough repair; this she has had, and came out of dock yesterday; she is said to sail well. The Caroline is a fine frigate, but not commissioned, for want of men. The Unaŏ is a very fine ship, wants copper, and is commanded by Captain Jewitt. The Nitherohy is a corvette, well found, and in good repair, but a heavy sailer; and the Maria da Gloria, a fine corvette, is commanded by a French officer, Captain Beaurepair. The great difficulty the navy here has to dread is the want of men. Portuguese sailors are worse than none; few Brazilians are sailors at all, and French, English, and Americans are very scarce. The Emperor is fond of the navy, and very active in looking into every department. He is often in the dock-yards by daylight, and the Empress generally accompanies him.",

    "Description":"[Trigger Warnings.]\n May 1st.—I have this day seen the Val Longo; it is the slave-market of Rio. Almost every house in this very long street is a depôt for slaves. On passing by the doors this evening, I saw in most of them long benches placed near the walls, on which rows of young creatures were sitting, their heads shaved, their bodies emaciated, and the marks of recent itch upon their skins. In some places the poor creatures were lying on mats, evidently too sick to sit up. At one house the half-doors were shut, and a group of boys and girls, apparently not above fifteen years old, and some much under, were leaning over the hatches, and gazing into the street with wondering faces. They were evidently quite new negroes. As I approached them, it appears that something about me attracted their attention; they touched one another, to be sure that all saw me, and then chattered in their own African dialect with great eagerness. I went and stood near them, and though certainly more disposed to weep, I forced myself to smile to them, and look cheerfully, and kissed my hand to them, with all which they seemed delighted, and jumped about and danced, as if returning my civilities. Poor things! I would not, if I could, shorten their moments of glee, by awakening them to a sense of the sad things of slavery; but, if I could, I would appeal to their masters, to those who buy, and to those who sell, and implore them to think of the evils slavery brings, not only to the negroes but to themselves, not only to themselves but to their families and their posterity.\n \n After all, slaves are the worst and most expensive servants; and one proof of it is this, I think. The small patch that each is allowed to cultivate for his own use on many estates generally yields at least twice as much in proportion as the land of the master, though fewer hours of labour are bestowed upon it.[104] I have hitherto endeavoured, without success, to procure a correct statement of the number of slaves imported into all Brazil. I fear, indeed, it will be hardly possible for me to do so, on account of the distance of some of the ports; but I will not rest till I procure at least a statement of the number entered at the custom-house here during the last two years. The number of ships from Africa that I see constantly entering the harbour, and the multitudes that throng the slave-houses in this street, convince me that the importation must be very great. The ordinary proportion of deaths on the passage is, I am told, about one in five.",

My good neighbours, Colonel and Mrs. Cunningham, try by their hospitality to prevent my feeling so much the loss of my friends Mr. and Mrs. May, who were every thing kind to me while at the Gloria.\n \n Botafogo bay is certainly one of the most beautiful scenes in the world; but, till of late years, its shores were little inhabited by the higher classes of society. At the farthest end there is a gorge between the Corcovado mountain and the rocks belonging to what may be called the Sugar-loaf group, which leads to the Lagoa of Rodrigo Freites, through which gorge a small rivulet of fine fresh water runs to the sea. Just at its mouth, there has long been a village inhabited by gipsies, who have found their way hither, and preserve much of their peculiarity of appearance and character in this their trans-atlantic home. They conform to the religion of the country in all outward things, and belong to the parish of which the curate of Nossa Senhora da Monte is pastor; but their conformity does not appear to have influenced their moral habits. They employ their slaves in fishing, and part of their families is generally resident at their settlements; but the men rove about the country, and are the great horse-jockies of this part of Brazil. Some of them engage in trade, and many are very rich, but still they are reputed thieves and cheats; and to call a man Zingara (gipsy) is as much as to call him knave. They retain their peculiar dialect; but I have not been able, personally, to get sufficiently acquainted with them to form any judgment of the degree in which their change of country and climate may have affected their original habits.\n \n [Text continues about socio-political situation.]",

    "Description":"15th.—The feast of Our Lady of the Assumption, called here Nossa Senhora da Gloria, the patroness of the Emperor's eldest child, is celebrated to-day, and of course the whole of the royal family attended Mass in the morning and evening. I was spending the day with Mrs. May, at her pleasant house on the Gloria hill, and we agreed to go in the afternoon to see the ceremony. The church is situated on a platform, rather more than half way up a steep eminence overlooking the bay. The body is an octagon of thirty-two feet diameter; and the choir, of the same shape, is twenty-one feet in diameter. We entered among a great crowd of persons, and placed ourselves within the choir; and shortly afterwards the Imperial party entered, and I was not disagreeably surprised at being most pleasantly recognised. The salutation, as this evening's service is called, was well performed as to music, and very short: after it, for the first time, I heard a Portuguese sermon. It was of course occasional. The text, 1 Kings, chap. ii. ver. 19.—\"And the king rose up to meet his mother, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the \"king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.\" The application of this text to the legend of the Assumption is obvious, and occupied the first division of the discourse. The second part consisted in an application of the history of the early part of Solomon's reign to the present circumstances of Brazil; the restoration of the kingdom, the triumph over faction, and the institution of laws, forming the grounds of comparison. The whole people of Brazil were called upon to join in thanksgiving and prayers to the Virgin of Glory: thanksgiving that she had given to her people, as rulers, the descendants of the Emanuels, the Johns, and the Henrys of Portugal, and of the Maria Theresas of Austria; and prayers that she would continue her gracious protection, and that most especially to the eldest hope of Brazil, named after her and dedicated to her. The whole was gravely and properly done, with as little of the appearance of flattery to the illustrious persons present as possible, and did not last above fifteen minutes. On this occasion, the veadors, and other persons attendant on the Imperial family, wore white silk surplices, and bore torches in their hands.\n \n I went in the evening to a ball and concert at the Baronesa de Campos: on entering, I was met by the young ladies of the family, and led up to their grandmother; and after paying my compliments to her, I was placed among the division of the family where I had most acquaintance. There were only two Englishwomen besides Lady Cochrane and myself, and these were the wives of the consul and the commissioner for the slave business. A foreign gentleman present remarked, that though we were but four, we hardly conversed together. This was perfectly true: I like, when I am in foreign society, to talk to foreigners; and think it neither wise nor civil to form coteries with those of one's own nation in such cases. Several rooms were open, for cards; the stakes, I fancy, were high. The tea-room was no sooner full, than tea was handed round; and I perceived that some of the older servants, with great respect indeed, spoke to such of the guests as they were acquainted with. After tea, I had the pleasure of again hearing Dona Rosa sing, and almost grudged my gayer companions their ball, which broke in upon that \"sober certainty of waking bliss,\" which music inspires into all, and especially to those who have known sorrow. I am no musician; but sweet sounds, especially those of the human voice, whether in speaking or singing, have a singular power over me.\n \n [Commentary on event.]",

    "Description":"20th.—I had long wished to see a little more of the neighbourhood of Rio than I have hitherto done; and had resolved on riding at least to Santa Cruz, about fourteen leagues from hence, and as the road is too well travelled to fear extraordinary accidents, and I am not timid as to common inconveniences, I had determined to hire a black attendant and go alone. This determination, however, was over-ruled by Mr. and Mrs. May, whose brother, Mr. Dampier, kindly offered to escort me. I confess I was very glad to be relieved of the absolute charge of myself, and not a little pleased to have the society of a well-bred, intelligent young man, whose taste for the picturesque beauties of nature agrees with my own.—I think that if there is one decided point in which fellow-travellers agree, however different in age, temper, or disposition, there may always be peace and pleasant conversation, more especially, if, as is our case, they travel on horseback. A difference of opinion is so easily evaded by a reference to one's horse, which may always go too fast or too slow, or exercise one's tongue or one's whip without any offence to one's two-legged companion.—We were well tried to-day. I had taken it into my head, that after having postponed our journey from week to week on one account or an other, if we did not begin it this day we never should go at all: and, therefore, though the afternoon was most unpromising, we left Mr. May's at half-past four o'clock, that we might reach Campinha, the first stage, to sleep; for, alas! these horses are not like my Chilian steeds, that would carry me twenty leagues a day without complaining. We mounted then, Mr. Dampier on a tall bay horse high in bone, with a brace of pistols buckled round him, in a huge straw hat, and a short jacket; I on a little grey horse, my boat-cloak over my saddle; otherwise dressed as usual, with a straw riding hat, and dark grey habit; and our attendant Antonio, the merriest of negroes, on a mule, with Mr. Dampier's portmanteau behind, and my bag before him.—We proceeded by the upper part of the town, and along the well-trodden road to San Cristovaŏ, and after crossing the little hill to the left of the palace, entered on a country quite new to me. From the western side of the entrance to Rio Janeiro, a high mountainous ridge extends close to the sea, as far as the Bay of Angra dos Reyes, formed by Ilha Grande and Marambaya. On the northern side of this ridge there is a plain, here and there varied by low hills, extending quite to the most inland part of Rio de Janeiro, and reaching in a winding direction to the bay of Angra dos Reyes: itself having probably at no very remote period been covered with water, connecting these two bays, and insulating the mountains above mentioned. Along this plain our road lay between grand scenery on the one hand, and soft and beautiful landscape on the other; but to-night all was dark and louring; the tops of the mountains were wrapped in mists, that rushed impetuously down their sides, or through their clefts, and every now and then a hollow sound of wind came from out of them, though the blast did not quite reach us. Under this sort of cloud we passed the picturesque Pedragulha, and the little port of Benefica, formed by a creek of the Rio. By the time we reached Praya Pequena, where a good deal of produce is embarked for the city, the clouds had closed dully in, and the grand mountain mists had lost their character. Still we went on, leaving the bay entirely: and first we passed the Venda Grande, where every necessary for horse or man travelling, is to be sold; then the Capon do Bispo, a pretty village, which the rain clouds made me long to stop at; and then the stone bridge of Rio de Ferreira, where the rain at length began to fall in large cold drops; then tremendous gusts of wind came out of the mountain gaps, and long before we reached the Casca d'ouro, the protection of cloaks and umbrellas had ceased to avail. There we might have stopped; but having been told that the Venda of Campinha was the best resting-place, we resolved to proceed, and with some pains prevailed on my horse to go on: we reached the venda. But if it be delightful, after a long wet ride in a dark and boisterous night, to arrive at a place of rest, it is at least as wretched to be turned from the door where you hope to find shelter, with dripping clothes and shivering limbs; yet such was our fate. There was nothing at the venda to eat, no place for us, none for our horses, and so we set out again to brave the pitiless storm; a few yards, however, brought us to a low cottage on the road side, and there we knocked. A mulatto serving-man came round cautiously to reconnoitre from the back of the house, when having ascertained that we really were English travellers benighted and wet, the front door was opened, and we found within a middle-aged very kind-looking woman, and her little daughter; her name is Maria Rosa d'Acunha. Her husband and son were absent on business, and she and the little girl were alone. As soon as we had changed our wet clothes, and had provided for the horses, which our hostess put into an empty building, she gave us warm coffee, bread and cheese, and extended her hospitable care to the negro. She gave Mr. Dampier her son's bed, and made up a couch for me in the room where she and the child slept. These people are of the poorest class of farmers, not possessing above four or five slaves, and working hard themselves. They appear happy however, and I am sure are very hospitable.",

    "Description":"[Location is guessed assumption.]\n 21st.—This morning looked at least as threatening as yesterday, but we determined to go as far as the Engenho dos Affonsos, for whose owner, Senhor Joam Marcus Vieira, we had letters from a friend in town. Accordingly we took leave of our kind hostess, who had made coffee early for us, and proceeded along a league of very pretty road to the Affonsos. Where that estate joins Campinha there is a large tiled shed where we found a party of travellers, apparently from the mines, drying their clothes and baggage after the last night's storm. A priest, and two or three men apparently above the common, appeared to be the masters of the party; the baggage was piled up on one side of the shed, and the arms were stuck into the cordage which bound it. There was a great fire in the middle, where a negro was boiling coffee, and several persons round drying clothes. Generally speaking, the men we met on their way from the mines are a fine, handsome race, lightly and actively made. Their dress is very picturesque. It consists of an oval cloak, lined and bordered with some bright colour such as rose or apple green, worn as the Spanish Americans wear the poncho. The sides are often turned up over the shoulders, and display a bright coloured jacket below. The breeches are loose, and reach to the knee, and loose boots of brown leather are frequently seen on the better sort, though it is very common to see the spurs upon the naked heel, and no boot or shoe of any kind. The higher classes have generally handsome pistols or great knives, the others content themselves with a good cudgel. A short league from the last house of Campinha, brought us to Affonsos, where we presented our letter, and were most kindly welcomed.—The estate belongs in fact to the grandmother of Senhor Joaŏ Marcus, who is a native of St. Catherine's, and a widow. His mother, and sister, and brother, and two dumb cousins also reside here, but he is only an occasional visitor, being married, and living near his wife's family. The dumb ladies, no longer young, are very interesting; they are extremely intelligent, understanding most things said in Portuguese by the motion of the lips, so that their cousin spoke in French, when he wished to say any thing of them; they make themselves understood by signs, many of which, I may say most, would be perfectly intelligible to the pupils of Sicard or Braidwood. They are part of a family of eight children, four of whom are dumb, the dumb and the speakers being born alternately. One of them made breakfast for us, which consisted of coffee, and various kinds of bread and butter.",

    "Description":"Friday, August 22d.—The day as fine as possible; and after breakfast we pursued our journey to Santa Cruz, the road improving in beauty as we proceeded.\n  \"Here lofty trees to ancient song unknown,\n  The noble sons of potent heat, and floods\n  Prone rushing from the clouds, rear'd high to heav'n\n  Their thorny stems, and broad around them threw\n  Meridian gloom.\"\n And above all these the mountains rose in the distance, and lower hills more near, between which, long valleys stretched themselves till the eye could follow them no farther; and the foregrounds were filled up with gigantic aloes, streams, and pools, and groups of passing cattle and their picturesquely clad conductors. Near Campo Grande, the scenery is diversified by several little green plains, with only an insulated tree here and there, decorated with air plants in bloom, and scarlet creepers. Beyond this lies one of the most beautiful spots I ever saw, namely, Viaga; where the rocks, trees, plains, and buildings, seem all placed on purpose to be admired. Having loitered a little to admire it, we rode on to the New Freguezia of Sant Antonio, where we stopped at a very neat venda to rest and feed our horses. The church is on a little hill, overlooking a very pretty country and a neat village, but the greater part of the parish is very distant. While the horses were eating their maize, we procured for ourselves some rusk, cheese from the province of Minas exactly like Scotch kebbuck, and port wine from the cask of excellent quality. These provisions are always to be had, with beans, bacon, and dried beef. But the hospitality of a Brazilian inn does not extend to cooking food for travellers, who generally carry the utensils for that purpose with them, and who in some shed attached to the inn cook for themselves, and generally sleep in the same shed. At Sant Antonio there are decent sleeping-rooms provided with benches and mats, to which the guests add what bedding they please; but travellers commonly wrap themselves in their cloaks, and so rest. As soon as our horses were ready, we rode on to Mata Paciencia, the engenho of Dona Mariana, the eldest daughter of the Baroness de Campos, and to whom we had a letter of introduction. Here we met with a most polite reception from a handsome ladylike woman, whom we found attending to her engenho, which is indeed an interesting one. We were received at first by the chaplain, a polite and well-informed person; and with him was the chaplain of Santa Cruz, who having been formerly a professor in the college at Rio, is commonly known by the name of the Padre Mestre.\n \n Dona Mariana led us into the engenho, where we had seats placed near the rollers, which are worked by an eight-horse power steam-engine, one of the first, if not the very first, erected in Brazil. There are here 200 slaves, and as many oxen, in constant employ. The steam-engine, besides the rollers in the sugar-house, moves several saws; so that she has the advantage of having her timber prepared almost without expense. While we were sitting by the machine, Dona Mariana desired the women, who were supplying the canes, to sing, and they began at first with some of their own wild African airs, with words adopted at the moment to suit the occasion. She then told them to sing their hymns to the Virgin; when, regularly in tune and time, and with some sweet voices, the evening and other hymns were sung; and we accompanied Dona Mariana into the house, where we found that while we had been occupied in looking at the machinery, the boilers, and the distillery, dinner had been prepared for us, though it was long after the family hour. On our departure, we were hospitably pressed to return on our way back to Rio, which we, \"nothing loath,\" promised to do.",

    "Description":"Saturday, 23d.—The morning was excessively cold but clear, and the view of the extensive plains of Santa Cruz, with the herds of cattle upon it, most magnificent. The pasture, which extends many leagues on each side of the little hill on which the palace and village are situated, is here and there varied by clumps of natural wood; the horizon extends to the sea in one direction, and every where else the view is bounded by mountains or woody hills. The palace itself occupies the site of the old Jesuits' college. Three sides are modern: the fourth contains the handsome chapel of the very reverend fathers, and a few tolerable apartments. The new part was built for King John VI., but the works were stopped on his departure. The apartments are handsome, and comfortably furnished. In this climate hangings, whether of paper or silk, are liable to speedy decay from damp and insects. The walls are therefore washed with a rich creamy white clay, called Taboa Tinga[120], and cornices and borders painted on them in distemper. Some of these are exceedingly beautiful in design, and generally very well executed, the arabesques of the friezes being composed of the fruits, flowers, birds, and insects of the country. One of the rooms represents a pavilion; and between the open pilasters, the scenery round Santa Cruz is painted, not well indeed, but the room is pleasant and cheerful. The artists employed were chiefly mulattoes and creole negroes.\n \n After breakfast, we rode along the causeway that crosses the plain of Santa Cruz, to the Indian aldea of San Francisco Xavier de Itaguahy, commonly called Taguahy, formed by the Jesuits not very long before their expulsion. The situation of the aldea and church is extremely fine; on the summit of a hill overlooking a rich plain, watered by a navigable river, and surrounded by mountains. We entered several of the huts of the Indians, whom I had understood to be of the Guaranee nation. I enquired of one of the women, in whose hut I sat down, if she knew whence her tribe came: she said no; she had been brought, when a mere child, from a great distance to Taguahy, by the fathers of the company; that her husband had died when she was young; that she and her daughters had always lived there; but her sons and grandsons, after the fathers of the company went, had returned to their fathers, by which she meant that they had resumed their savage life. This is not surprising. The Indians here must work for others, and become servants; a state they hardly distinguish from slavery. Besides, slaves are plentiful; and as the negro is hardier than the Indian, his labour is more profitable; therefore, a willing Indian does not always find a master. The produce of his little garden, or his fishing, is rarely sufficient for his family; and without the protection of the priest, whose chief favour was procuring constant occupation, the half-reclaimed savage droops, and flies again to the liberty of his forest, to his unrestrained hunting and fishing. The Chilian Indians rarely or never return to their forests when their villages are once formed; but that depends on circumstances, which have nothing in common with the state of Brazil. Many of the Indian women have married the creole Portuguese; intermarriages between creole women and Indian men are more rare. The children of such couples are prettier, and appear to me to be more intelligent, than the pure race of either. The Indian huts at Taguahy are very poor; barely sufficient in walls and roof to keep out the weather, and furnished with little besides hammocks and cooking utensils; yet we were every where asked to go in and sit down: all the floors were cleanly swept, and a log of wood or a rude stool was generally to be found for a seat for the stranger, the people themselves squatting on the ground.\n \n At the foot of the hill of Taguahy there is a very fine ingenho, sold by King Joam VI. to one de Barros; the rollers are worked by a horizontal water-wheel about twenty-two feet in diameter, turned by the little stream Taguahy. The quantity of sugar made in a given time is something more than that produced by the steam-engine at Mata Paciencia, the number of slaves employed being the same.\n \n After we had admired the neatness of the engenho and the beauty of the situation sufficiently, we left Taguahy to return to Santa Cruz, and re-crossed the river Guandu, where there is a guard-house by the bridge, where passes from the police are required from ordinary travellers; but as we had a servant from Santa Cruz with us, we were not questioned. The Guandu rises in the mountain of Marapicu, in the barony of Itanhae; and having received the Tingui, it passes to the engenho of Palmares, occupied by the Visconde de Merendal; where there is a wharf where the produce of the neighbouring estates is embarked, and conveyed to Sepetiva, a little port in the bay of Angra dos Reyes, where it is shipped for Rio, the passage thither being generally of twenty-four hours.\n \n In 1810 there was an intention of uniting the Guandu with the Itaipu by a short canal; by which means the produce, not only of this district, but of the Ilha Grande, would have been conveyed directly to Rio, without the risk of the navigation outside of the harbour: I know not why the project was abandoned.\n \n Every time I pass through a grove in Brazil, I see new flowers and plants, and a richness of vegetation that seems inexhaustible. To-day I saw passion-flowers of colours I never observed before; green, pink, scarlet, and blue: wild pine apples, of beautiful crimson and purple: wild tea, even more beautiful than the elegant Chinese shrub: marsh-palms, and innumerable aquatic plants, new to me: and in every little pool, wild-ducks, water-hens, and varieties of storks, were wading about in graceful pride. At every step I am inclined to exclaim with the minstrel—\n  \"Oh nature, how in every charm supreme!\n  Whose votaries feast on raptures ever new:\n  Oh, for the voice and fire of seraphim\n  To paint thy glories with devotion due!\"\n After dinner I walked about a little in the village of the negroes. There are, I believe, about fifteen hundred on the estate, the greater part of whom belong to the outlying farms or feitorias, of which there are, I believe, three; Bom Jardin, Piperi, and Serra: these yield coffee, feijoă, and maize. The immediate neighbourhood of Santa Cruz is appropriated to the rearing of cattle, of which there are this year about four thousand head; and a good deal of pasture land is annually let. The negroes of Santa Cruz are not fed and clothed by the Emperor, but they have their little portions of land; and they have half of Friday, all Saturday and Sunday, and every holiday, to labour for themselves; so that they at most work for their master four days, in return for their house and land; and some even of the external marks of slavery are removed, as the families feed and clothe themselves without the master's interference. The Emperor has appropriated great part of a very commodious building, erected by his father for the royal stud, to the purpose of an hospital. I visited it, and found a white surgeon and black assistant; decent beds, and well-ventilated apartments: the kitchen was clean, and the broth, which was all I found cooked at the time of night when I was there, good: there were about sixty patients, most of them merely for sores in their feet, some from giggers, others a sort of leprosy from working in damp grounds, and a few with elephantiases; fevers are very rare; pulmonary complaints not uncommon. Several of the inmates of the hospital were there merely from old age; one was insane; and there was a large ward of women, with young children: so that, on the whole, I consider the hospital as affording a proof of the healthiness of the negroes of Santa Cruz.",

    "Description":"Our hospitable friends the Capitaŏ and his lady would not allow us to leave them till after dinner, having invited several persons to do honour to us, and to a sumptuous feast they had prepared, where every good thing that can be named was present. However, due honour having been done to the table, we took our leave; and at about four o'clock or a little earlier set off for Mata Paciencia, where we arrived a little before sunset.\n \n On our arrival we went with Dona Mariana and the chaplain into the garden, which unites the flower, kitchen-garden, and orchard in one. Oranges and roses, cabbage and tobacco, melons and leeks, neighboured each other, as if they belonged to the same climate; and all were thriving among numbers of weeds, of which the wholesome calliloo and the splendid balsam attracted my eye most. A side-door in the garden let us into a beautiful field, whither chairs were brought, that we might sit and enjoy the freshness of the evening. Overhanging that field there is a steep hill, on whose side a great deal of wood has been cleared away, and the gardens and coffee plots of the negroes occupy the ground. This day—and blessed be the Sabbath!—is the negroes' own: after morning Mass they are free to do their own will; and then most of them run to the hill to gather their coffee or maize, or prepare the ground for these or other vegetables. They were just beginning to return from the wood, each with his little basket laden with something of his own, something in which the master had no share; and again and again as they passed me, and displayed with glistening eye the little treasure, I blessed the Sabbath, the day of freedom to the slave. Presently the last few stragglers dropped in. The sun by this time was only the tops of the hills. The cattle flocked in from the pasture, and lowed impatiently at the gate of the corral: we opened it, and passed in with them, and crossed the court where the negroes live. All was bustle there: they were bargaining with a huckster, who, knowing the proper hour, had arrived to buy the fresh-picked coffee. Some sold it thus; others chose to keep it and dry it, and then to take the opportunity of one of the lady's messengers to town and send it thither, where it sells at a higher price. I do not know when I have passed so pleasant an evening.\n \n After supper I had a great deal of conversation with Dona Mariana concerning the sugar-work, the cultivation of the cane, and the slaves, confirming what I had learnt at Affonsos. She also tells me, as I had heard before, that the Creole negroes are less docile and less active than the new negroes. I think both facts may be accounted for without having recourse to the influence of climate. The new negro has the education of the slave-ship and the market, the lash being administered to drill him; so that when bought he is docile from fear, active from habit. The creole negro is a spoiled child, till he is strong enough to work; then, without previous habits of industry, he is expected to be industrious, and having eaten, drunk, and run about on terms of familiar equality, he is expected to be obedient; and where no moral feelings have been cultivated, he is expected to show his gratitude for early indulgence by future fidelity. Dona Mariana tells me, that not half the negroes born on her estate live to be ten years old. It would be worth while to enquire into the cause of this evil, and whether it is general.\n \n I conversed also a good while with the chaplain on the general state of the country. He is a native of Pernambuco; of course a staunch independent. * * * It is needless to say that every thing in the manner of living at Mata Paciencia is not only agreeable but elegant. And if the stories of older travellers concerning the country life of the Brazilians be true, the change has been most rapid and complete.",

The house is exceedingly clean, and so are the beds for the foundling children, only three of whom are now in-door nurslings, the rest being placed out in the country. Till lately they have died in a proportion frightful compared with their numbers. Within little more than nine years, 10,000 children have been received: these were placed out at nurse, and many were never accounted for. Not perhaps that they all died, because the temptation of retaining a mulatto child as a slave, would most likely secure care of its life; but the white ones had not even this chance of safety. Besides, the wages paid for the nursing of each was formerly so little, that the poor creatures who received them could hardly have afforded them the means of subsistence. A partial amendment has taken place, and still greater improvements are about to be made. There is a great want of medical treatment. Many of the foundlings are placed in the wheel[127], full of disease, fever, or more often a dreadful species of itch called sarna, and which is often fatal to them. Nay, dead children are also brought, that they may be decently interred.\n \n From the asylum, I crossed the street to the great hospital of the Misericordia. It is a fine building, and has plenty of room; but it is not in so good a state as might be wished: there are usually four hundred patients, and the number of deaths very great; but I could not learn the exact proportion. The medical department is in great want of reform. The insane ward interested me most of all: it is on the ground floor, very cold and damp; and most of those placed in it die speedily of consumptive complaints. I found here a contradiction to the vulgar opinion, that hydrophobia is not known in Brazil. A poor negro had been bitten by a mad dog a month ago; he did not seem very ill till yesterday morning, when he was sent here. He was at the grate of his cell as we passed him, in a deplorable state: knowing the gentleman who was with me, he had hoped he would release him from confinement; this of course could not be: he expired a few hours after we saw him. The burial-ground of the Misericordia is so much too small as to be exceedingly disgusting, and, I should imagine, unwholesome for the neighbourhood. I had long wished to do what I have done to-day. I think the more persons that show an interest in such establishments the better: it fixes attention upon them; and that of itself must do good. Yet my courage had hitherto failed, and I owe the excursion of this morning to accident rather than design.\n \n I rode this evening to the protestant burial-ground, at the Praya de Gamboa. I think it one of the loveliest spots I ever beheld, commanding beautiful views every way. It slopes gradually towards the road along the shore: at the highest point there is a pretty building, consisting of three chambers; one serves as a place of meeting or waiting for the clergyman occasionally; one as a repository for the mournful furniture of the grave; and the largest, which is between the other two, is generally occupied by the body of the dead for the few hours, it may be a day and a night, which can in this climate elapse between death and burial: in front of this are the various stones, and urns, and vain memorials we raise to relieve our own sorrow; and between these and the road, some magnificent trees. Three sides of this field are fenced by rock or wood. Even Crabbe's fanciful and delicate Jane might have thought without pain of sleeping here.[128] In my illness I had often felt sorry that I had not seen this ground. I am satisfied now; and if my still lingering weakness should lay me here, the very, very few who may come to see where their friend lies will feel no disgust at the prison-house.",

    "Description":"October 12th.—This is the Emperor's birth-day, and the first anniversary of the coronation. I was curious to see the court of Brazil; so I rose early and dressed myself, and went to the royal chapel, where the Emperor and Empress, and the Imperial Princess were to be with the court before the drawing-room. I accordingly applied to the chaplain for a station, who showed me into what is called the diplomatic tribune, but it is in fact for respectable foreigners: there I met all manner of consuls. However, the curiosity which led me to the chapel would not allow me to go home when the said consuls did; so I went to the drawing-room, which perhaps, after all, I should not have done, being quite alone, had not the gracious manner in which their Imperial Majesties saluted me, both in the chapel and afterwards in the corridor leading to the royal apartments, induced me to proceed. I reached the inner room where the ladies were, just as the Emperor had, with a most pleasing compliment, announced to Lady Cochrane that she was Marchioness of Maranham; for that he had made her husband Marques, and had conferred on him the highest degree of the order of the Cruceiro. I am sometimes absent; and now, when I ought to have been most attentive, I felt myself in the situation Sancho Pança so humorously describes, of sending my wits wool-gathering, and coming home shorn myself: for I was so intent on the honour conferred on my friend and countryman; so charmed, that for once his services had been appreciated,—that when I found the Emperor in the middle of the room, and that his hand was extended towards me, and that all others had paid their compliments and passed to their places, I forgot I had my glove on, took his Imperial hand with that glove, and I suppose kissed it much in earnest, for I saw some of the ladies smile before I remembered any thing about it. Had this happened with regard to any other prince, I believe that I should have run away; but nobody is more good-natured than Don Pedro: I saw there was no harm done; and so determining to be on my guard when the Empress came in, and then to take an opportunity of telling her of my fault, I stayed quietly, and began talking to two or three young ladies who were at court for the first time, and had just received their appointment as ladies of honour to the Empress.",

I had no opportunity of learning more, as the vessel passed hastily.\n \n We have, generally speaking, had hot winds from Africa, and there is a sultry feel in the air which the state of the thermometer hardly accounts for. I perceive that the sails are all tinged with a reddish colour; and wherever a rope has chafed upon them, they appear almost as if iron-moulded. This the captain and officers attribute to the wind from Africa. They were certainly perfectly white long after we left Rio; they have not been either furled or unbent. What may be the nature of the dust or sand that thus on the wings of the wind crosses so many miles of ocean, and stains the canvass? Can it be this minute dust affecting the lungs which makes us breathe as if in the sultry hours preceding a thunder-storm?",

    "Description":"[Place picked somewhat at random.]\n 18th.—After passing the Azores, a long succession of gales from the north-east kept us off the land. These were succeeded by three fine days; and the sea, which had been heavy, became smooth. Early the day before yesterday, however, it began to blow very hard from the northwest; and yesterday morning it changed to a gale from the south and south-west, and we lay-to under storm stay-sails, in a tremendous sea. About one o'clock the captain called to me, and desired me to come on deck and see what could not last ten minutes, and I might never see again. I ran up, as did Mrs. and Miss K——. A sudden shift of wind had taken place: we saw it before it came up, driving the sea along furiously before it; and the meeting of the two winds broke the sea as high as any ship's mast-head in a long line, like the breakers on a reef of rocks. It was the most beautiful yet fearful sight I ever beheld; and the sea was surging over our little vessel so as to threaten to fill her: but the hatches were battoned down; we were lying-to on a right tack, and a hawser had been passed round the bits in order to sustain the foremast, in case we lost our bowsprit, as we expected to do every instant. But in twenty minutes the gale moderated, and we bore up for Falmouth, which we reached this morning, having passed the cabin deck of a ship that doubtless had foundered in the storm of yesterday.—Once more I am in England; and, to use the words of a venerable though apocryphal writer, \"Here will I make an end. And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I desired; but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.\"",

What a strange inquisitive being man is ! When his curiosity is once on the wing, no trouble appears repulsive, no obstacle insurmountable; but he levels, in his imagination, the road which is to conduct him to the conclusion of his wishes, and allows no intermediate difficulty to check his inclination, or deter him from his pursuit. \n \n [...]\n \n The whole city is split into parties, and, at the corner of every principal street, the glaring letters of some inflammatory handbill invite the eye. All the coffee-houses are crowded with pretended politicians, who, according to their various prejudices, vent the noxious torrent of their fury ; and groups of hirelings, half intoxicated, are every where bawling out their national airs. Even at the theatres, places which were instituted for sober relaxation and rational amusement, the boisterous voice of faction intrudes itself, and cannot be silenced. The aristocratical party, however, has lately, after a severe struggle, evidently gained ground, and is now sufficiently respectable to venture to avow itself. \n \n [...]\n \n Paris, on the whole, as a city, is excessively dirty, and but indifferently built. The streets are irregular and narrow, and, from the want of a side pavement, the foot passengers run the risk of being crushed to death by the carriages which are continually passing, and are driven with great fury. Many very elegant and magnificent structures are, however, dispersed through different parts of the town ; and the Palais Royaly two or three of the squares, some of the principal hotels, and a few of the streets which have been lately built, are extremely grand and ornamental. With regard to the churches, palaces, cabinets of curiosities, and collections of pictures and statues, these are not the times to see them. Many of them indeed which, formerly, were the just pride of their possessors, and the delight and admiration of strangers, have already been plundered by the avarice of the government, or have fallen a sacrifice to the savage and indiscriminate fury of a misguided populace.

The roof of one of the fronts has fallen in, and it is passed every day by thousands of people, who view it with as much unconcern, as if it only exhibited the wreck of some miserable hut. If Louis the XlVth were to rise from the dead, and behold his favourite palace in this neglected and ruinous condition, how the blood would boil in his veins !

    "Description":"A few nights ago, we went to the Comédie-Italienne, where we were tolerably well entertained. Caius Gracchus was represented; a tragedy which abounds with the language and spirit of republicanism. The merit of the actor, who performed the principal character, was not very striking ; but the plaudits, which were showered down upon him when he repeated a line in praise of liberty, were not easily appeased ; whilst many, in another part of the house, cheered the consul with marks of their approbation, when he delivered a sentence expressive of the importance of good order, and the necessity of preserving the different ranks of society. And although the manifestations of these were generally overpowered by the shouts and hisses of the opposing demagogues, it was not without a violent contest. At the conclusion of the play, a most farcical incident occurred. Gracchus, who, but a few minutes before, had died on the stage of his wounds, was loudly called for, nor did the clamours of the pit subside till he made his appearance; when, after being gratified with repeated bursts of applause, he was again permitted to retire to the gloomy mansions of the dead.",

The building, which consists of several piles, erected at different times, in the disposal of which no regard has been paid to the rules of symmetry, has a stately appearance, rather on account of its extent than from the materials of which it is composed. Many of the apartments, which, collectively, are said to amount to the astonishing number of fifteen hundred, of different dimensions, are furnished with magnificence and taste, and the chapel is universally admired. What, however, principally attracted our attention was the gallery of Francis the First. It is of a great length, and, in the days of that munificent and splendid prince, was frequented by his court as a morning parade. One side of it is lined with small recesses, which were then fitted up as shops, where the most elegant and costly goods were displayed.

It is situated on the Allier, in the middle of a fertile and extensive plain, and is much resorted to on account of its medicinal waters. It is said to take its name from the many windmills in the neighbourhood. The inhabitants carry on a considerable traffic in cutlery, which they have brought to a perfection that has given a celebrity to the place. \n \n As we alighted from our carriage, we were followed into the inn by about a dozen women, who had each a portable box, containing knives, scissars, and various trinkets in steel. Every one begged, with importunity, that we would buy something ; but we were deaf to their entreaties, and should, I believe, have escaped without any expence, had not, at the very moment they were withdrawing, a most lovely girl entered the room, whose solicitations it was impossible to resist. All our resolutions were immediately overpowered ; and, as if by previous consent, we, without hesitation, untied our purses, and purchased almost every thing she recommended. There is, indeed, a magical influence about beauty ; and the simple accents which flow from a pair of rosy lips, are more persuasive, and frequently more convincing, than the learning of the scholar or the eloquence of the statesman. The town itself is Indifferently built, but the public walks on the banks of the river are very pleasant, and in one of the churches is the tomb of the illustrious and accomplished duke of Montmorenci, who was beheaded at Thoulouse in 1632. It as erected to his memory by his duchess, as a testimonial of her affection and regret, and is greatly admired both for the workmanship and the materials.",

Its happy situation at the confluence of the Rhone and the Soane (two rivers which intersect the richest provinces of France) distinguishes it for its commercial advantages, and the spirit and enterprise of its inhabitants have not allowed these channels of industry and wealth to remain unemployed. Its chief manufacture is silk, which is brought, in the raw state, from Provence, Piedmont, and other parts, and which, when fabricated is distributed over half the globe. \n \n As we have stopped here two days, I tiave had an opportunity of viewing almost every thing that is worthy of attention ; and as the objects are numerous, to pre vent confusion, I shall set down the observations that have occurred to mc, in the order in which they were made. \n \n The streets, like those of Paris, are in general very narrow, and the houses, which are built of stone, are too lofty to produce a pleasing effect. Many of them also, on account of the excessive heats in the summer, have windows of oiled paper, which give them a gloomy and inelegant appearance.

    "Description":"From the terrace of the monastery of the Carthusians, there is a charming view of Lyons and the adjacent country. The gardens, which lie on a declivity bounded by the Soane, are planted with vines, which were formerly cultivated by the hands of the friars. This monastery, with the lands that appertained to it, has lately been confiscated, and sold at public auction: and its wretched inhabitants, who led a life of innocent contentment within its walls ; who regarded it as the asylum of peace ; as a safe and respectable retreat from the vices and vanities of the world ; as the boundary of their ambition on this side eternity ; suddenly reduced to penury and want, are now compelled, and most of them at an advanced period of life, to begin the world again ; to seek a refuge elsewhere; and to owe their bread to a humiliating dependence on the fleeting generosity of an iron age. — Ill-fated men ! you have my compassion, for you have been cruelly used : but what could you expect, when rogues are legislators, and legislators are enriched by the wages of plunder; when the modesty of virtue is abashed by the impudence of vice ; when wisdom is persecuted and despised, and venality encouraged and promoted ; when a hardened and profane contempt of the most sacred obligations insures applause, and levels the road to power and emolument; when an antidote has been discovered against the pangs of an accusing conscience ; and every tie of nature, morality, and religion, is absorbed, by the malignant poison of self-interested ambition ? Whilst I thus warmly express myself, I must add, that I am far from being an advocate for the excessive riches and possessions which were, till lately, engrossed by the clergy of France, and which, whilst they were oppressive to the people, were Aery frequently bestowed on worthless objects. I recollect the misery which the intolerant and ambitious spirit of the Romish church has heaped on the human race. I recollect that, in every age of its usurpation, it has been distinguished for an avaricious, a mercenary, a cruel, an unrelenting, a sanguinary disposition. I think we ought to look, with some degree of jealousy, on the wealth and dominion of priests in every country. I abhor superstition, which is a corrupt source of the most odious crimes, which, whilst it enslaves the mind, debases the heart, and by holding out a pecuniary purchase of pardon, totally destroys all regard for virtue, and subverts the very foundation of the moral sense. But when a reform is to be introduced, it is surely right to proceed with caution and temper, and some lenity and compassion ought to be extended to a numerous body of men, many of whom are venerable from their age, respectable for their virtues, and eminent for their talents, and whose chief misfortune it has been, to have been born at a time, when the government of their country held out an encouragement to the profession they follow.",

    "Description":"The convent of the Carmelite nuns, which was built by the Villeroy family, at an immense expence, is likewise, it is feared, on the eve of dissolution; for although the ornaments of the church are not yet removed, divine service is no longer suffered to be performed in it. The great altar is magnificent, and is adorned with a picture, representing the descent of our Saviour from the cross, which ranks among Le Brun's most finished productions ; and one of the chapels contains the monument of the Villeroy family, which is admirably executed. \n \n We saw the abbess, who, with tears in her eyes, deprecated the misfortunes she speedily expected to incur : and not without reason : for such is the ferocious and predatory disposition of the ruling faction in this wretched and distracted country, that no discrimination is made between the good and the bad ; but every consideration is rendered subservient to their infatuated notions of present advantage. They forget that justice is the grand and substantial pedestal which can alone uphold any system of jurisprudence ; and that when once that divine attribute is banished from the proceedings of men, and honour is bartered, without remorse, for pecuniary compensation, they must inevitably revert to a state of dissolute barbarism and confusion. \n \n If it were deemed politic or necessary to introduce a reform into religious establishments, and to curtail the luxuries and extravagancies of the rich benefices, even lliat ought to have been effected by degrees, and some attention ought to have been paid to the common dictates of equity and decorum. If the superfluous revenues of the opulent had been retrenched, and if those, who received merely a competency, had been allowed to enjoy it till they were gradually removed by the hand of time, the state would have been eventually benefited ; a new and purer system of religion would have ripened to maturity ; the laws of justice would not have been invaded ; and the honour of the nation would have been spared. But totally to dispossess thousands, without distinction, of the whole of their property ; to deprive them of their only means of subsistence ; and to leave them, for future provision, at the entire disposal of chance ; was an unmanly and cowardly act. It was a public rohheryy rendered more glaringly atrocious, because, regardless of the opprobrium it was calculated to excite, it was sanctioned and ordained by a public decree, — Policy may frequently palliate, necessity may frequently excuse, the adoption of measures, which, under different circumstances, every wise and honest legislature would be wishful to avoid ; but to carve out public plans, for the mere advancement of individual interest, is the consummation of wickedness. Oh ! how power is per verted, when it is dealt out by contaminated minds!",

Circumstantial as these traditions are, very little credit is given to any part of the story by people of information ; and it is a doubt with many, whether that famous personage ever resided in this city. The cathedral is a noble Gothic edifice ; and the remains of an amphitheatre and a triumphal arch dispose one to entertain a favourable opinion of the former consequence and splendour of the place. At a small distance from the southern gate, there is a neat stone pyramid, which is conjectured to be the tomb of some ancient Roman.",

The lower orders of the people are contaminated by their example. They are extremely idle and neglect to avail themselves of the natural advantages which are afforded by a navigable river and a prolific soil. \n \n Notwithstanding this city is in the pope's territories, it has not been sheltered from the disorders of the times. A turbulent fellow, a blacksmith by profession, first roused the spirit of civil discord, and, by his boldness and activity, soon found himself at the head of a numerous banditti, whose fury raged, for some time, without control. This sedition, at length, got to such an alarming pitch, that it was judged necessary to send a French regiment to quell it, which was soon effected, and the ringleader was secured. Since then, lie has been under strict confinement ; but, as the number of his partisans is formidable, the sentence of his punishment has not been declared. This wretch, on account of the various cruelties and depredations which he has perpetrated, is regarded as an object of such hatred and horrour, that he is distinguished by the emphatic appellation of Coup-Gorge.,",

It consists of three bridges, one elevated on the other, and was constructed by Agrippa to convey water to the city. The lower bridge, which is thrown over the river Garden, is supported by six arches, and is four hundred and ninety-eight feet long, and sixty-two high. The arch, through which the river flows, is seventy-eight feet wide, and the other five are not much narrower. The second bridge, which is thirty feet in height, and eight hundred and nineteen in length, reposes on eleven arches, nearly of the same dimensions as the first; and the bridge, which sustains the aqueduct, is composed of thirty-five arches, each seventeen feet in breadth. The aqueduct, including the thickness of the stones, is four feet wide, and five high; and the whole of this magnificent structure presents an elevation, which, from the surface of the water to its summit, measures one hundred and forty- four feet. It is of the Tuscan order, almost in perfect preservation, and has altogether a most majestic appearance ; nor can it be contemplated without suggesting this reflection — that the Romans built, not only for themselves, but for future generations, determined to transmit to their posterity living testimonies of their power, their riches, and their skill.",

It would, perhaps, have been almost in a perfect state, had it not been for the blind and barbarous zeal of Charles Martel, who, to express his hatred of the Romans, and to revenge the miseries they had, at different times, inflicted on his country, ordered it to be demolished. In this view every part of it was filled with wood, which was set on fire. But the wishes of the monarch were not fulfilled; and, to this day, it presents one of the most majestic and venerable ruins it is possible to behold. The four principal entrances faced the cardinal points of the compass, and thirty-five benches (seventeen of which still remain), ranged one above the other, surrounded the inside, and accommodated, with ease, seventeen thousand people. It is built of large blocks of stone, and consists of two stories of porticos, of sixty arcades each. The top is crowned with a parapet, below which there is a range of equidistant stone brackets, which are all pierced, for the purpose of receiving the poles that suspended the awning over the spectators. The area, at present, is crowded with insignificant houses, which the municipality has lately purchased at a considerable expence, proposing to remove them, and to restore this superb edifice, in some measure, to its original splendour.",

It is of an oblong square form, from which it derives the name it now bears.

The ornamental parts of the sculpture, such as the frieze and cornice, display a delicacy of workmanship, and an exquisiteness of taste, which surpass all description. Antiquarians were very much divided in opinion, about the use to this structure, and the period of its elevation, till Mons. Seguier fell upon an ingenious method of decyphering the inscription, by applying letters, that correspond with the holes left, in the frieze, by the loss of the original ones.

The landlord, knowing that it is either chance, or necessity, which has thrown you in his way, and that, when once you take your leave, you will in all likelihood never return, makes the most of his good fortune, and charges you for every thing at ten times the rate of an ordinary customer.

Whilst we were changing horses, the postmaster came out, and, informing us of the danger of travelling to Aix by night, endeavoured to prevail on us to remain with him. He told us that we should really run the risk of our lives, as a man had been murdered, and the courier fired at, the preceding evening. But his house not having a very inviting appearance, we were not disposed to place much reliance on what he said, and, suspecting he was recounting these horrible stories merely from interested motives, we determined to proceed. When, however, we had got about half way, we met the courier attended by two men, armed with guns and cutlasses, who were walking at the side of his carriage. On inquiring of him, he told us, that what the postmaster had related had literally happened, which was the only reason of his travelling with guards. This was a confirmation which we could not discredit, and which raised our apprehensions so much, that we kept our pistols in our hands till we were safely lodged within the gates of Aix.",

It has, in some degree, retained its pre-eminence, and is still one of the most considerable and commercial cities in France. It contains about one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. The streets of the new town are regular and spacious ; the lazaretto is the most complete building of the kind in Europe ; and the harbour is one of the best in the Mediterranean. The country in which it, is situated is fertile, and the climate is mild and salubrious. Such are the advantages which it possesses, and which might secure the enjoyment of almost every object that is desirable in life, did not the factious spirit of its inhabitants (as if despising the favours of Providence) interfere, and thwart their natural influence. \n \n Civil dissensions have, since the revolution, been carried to a dangerous height ; and are rapidly tending towards the annihilation of all restraint. Not long since, the populace seized a poor woman, dragged her forcibly from her house, and, after having exhausted their ingenuity by the infliction of the most excruciating tortures, humanely put a period to her existence, by hansins: her with the cord of a lantern that was near at hand. They alleged against her, in extenuation of these violent proceedings, a long list of the blackest crimes, which apparently had no foundation in truth ; and I have been informed, that what principally rendered her obnoxious, was having formerly been the mistress of a magistrate, who, at the commencement of the troubles, saved himself by flight. \n \n [Text goes on about civil dissension.]\n \n The situation of Marseilles is admirably adapted for commerce, and the harbour, surrounded as it is by mountains, affords a secure shelter for the shipping as it arrives. The quays, which are very extensive, are handsomely and substantially built, and present a scene of perpetual business and bustle. The trade of this city, particularly with the Levant, before the present convulsions of France, was very considerable, and upwards of four thousand vessels, from different quarters, entered the harbour in the course of the year. All commercial concerns were under the inspection and control of a chamber of commerce, which was the first institution of the kind, and paved the way to their general establishment in 1701. The principal manufacture, which the inhabitants carry on, is in silk, which they have brought to great perfection ; and the oil, which is extracted from their olives, is allowed to be the finest in the world. Besides what is exported, it is an article of considerable home consumption, being a great ingredient in their cookery, and a substitute for butter, which is very scarce.",

I had recourse, by turns, to my books and my pen ; but such numerous causes of dissatisfaction were almost perpetually intruding on my thoughts, that the amusement, I derived from them, was barely negative.

She was steering towards us with all the sail she could crowd, and by eight o'clock had approached so near, that we could plainly distinguish her guns and men. To make as great a shew as possible, and impress them with a favourable opinion of our courage, we all mustered on deck, well provided with small arms. She, however, still continued to gain on us ; and as their strength was much superior to ours, and they seemed eager and determined in the pursuit of us, we thought it not improbable that an action might take place. This certainly was a moment which required firmness and decision ; but our captain was so overcome with fear, that he was totally at a loss what measures to pursue. Never shall I forget the melancholy and disgraceful figure which he made. Instead of encouraging his men to perform their duty, and, if they were to fall, to sell their lives dearly ; with a countenance which unveiled the faintness of his heart, he kept walking hastily up and down the deck, exclaiming at every other step, in a most disconsolate accent, \" Ah ! nous sommes tons perdus.\" I never witnessed an instance of such base and dastardly cowardice, and my feelings were so exasperated, that I almost longed to throw him into the sea. Our situation became every moment more critical; and the sailors, finding that their captain was incapable of directing them any longer, fired, without orders, two of our largest guns, which were so well pointed, that the balls fell within a few feet of the enemy's vessel. This resolute conduct alarmed the pirates so much, that they instantly hoisted the Russian colours, and, after some hesitation, shifted their sails, and steered for the coast of the Morea.\n \n The object of these wretches is a surprise, or an attack, where they suspect that scarcely any resistance can be made. A contest on equal terms they uniformly decline, and will seldom encounter, even an inferior force, if it be but well prepared to receive them. This, in truth, is generally the case with those who are engaged in a bad cause. They are \" sometimes led on by desperation to perpetrate the most daring acts, but they seldom possess that steady, determined resolution, which is the result of a good conscience, and which, by awakening circumspection, so frequently, in the honourable career of duty, ensures success. \n \n It is altogether disgraceful to the maritime powers of Europe, that these robbers should not only be allowed to insult their flags, and to commit, with impunity, the most atrocious depredations, but that they should even be encouraged, by the tributes they receive, to persist in a course of life, which is equally destructive of justice, morality, and national independence.",

Here we again had a sight of the very piratical vessel which had so much annoyed us the day before : but, being now in company with an Imperial ship, we had no danger to apprehend. \n \n This island is the ancient Cythera, so frequently the theme of the poets of antiquity. It was here that Venus is fabled to have first landed, when she rose, with resplendent majesty, from the foam of the sea ; and where she was worshipped, by the inhabitants, in a magnificent temple, dedicated to her memory. But it no longer possesses those attractive charms, which have been so highly celebrated, and which, probably, never existed, but in the glowing imaginations of its inspired bards. Instead of being the abode of plenty, and the residence of the laughing goddess and her graces, of the pleasures of love and the refinements of taste, it exhibits nothing but parched heaths and barren rocks, which scarcely produce a sufficient supply for its scanty population. At present, it belongs to the Venetians, and is the last remnant of their once splendid dominion in the Levant. \n \n Whilst we lay at anchor, I kept my eyes almost continually fixed on the Morea, the modern appellation of the Peloponnesus, once the theatre of actions which have ennobled the name and character of man ; once the favourite resort of the muses ; once the seat of enlightened eloquence, and profound erudition ; once the prolific nursery of legislators, philosophers, and heroes. When we contrast its former with its present state ; when we compare the soul of a Socrates or a Plato, with the blind and brutal instincts and appetites of its actual possessors ; we shrink, with mingled shame and compassion, from the task of investigation, and wish to draw a veil over the infirmities and degeneracy of the human mind.",

    "Description":"The wind being rather favourable, on the 27th, in the morning, we left Cerigo, and, after being tossed about for three successive days in the Archipelago, took refuge in the port of Milo.\n \n In ancient times, this island was flourishing and populous, and, during the Peloponnesian war, distinguished itself by the long and vigorous resistance which it made against the efforts of the Athenians to subdue it. Even so late as the beginning of this century, it was a place of considerable consequence, and the French merchants, who were then settled in it, carried on an extensive commerce. In those days, the corsairs were accustomed to bring all their prizes to this port to dispose of them, which occasioned a vast influx of strangers from every part of the Archipelago, and kept up the spirit of adventure and speculation. But this scene of prosperity has since completely vanished. The French have abandoned the island ; their churches, and the convent of Capuchins which they had founded, are in ruins ; and nothing is, at present, exhibited but a disgusting picture of misery and desolation. \n \n [...]\n \n In their tiring commercial transactions with the vessels which visit their port, like other Greeks, they are much addicted to chicane and low cunning. A particular instance of this nature fell under my own observation. One of them, who had purchased some bottles of our sailors, attempted to pay for them in false dollars. \n \n On being detected, he betrayed no signs of confusion ; but, pledging his word that it was merely a mistake, he deliberately put his hand into another pocket, and produced a bag of good money. \n \n Having consumed all the poultry we brought with us from Marseilles, as soon as we landed we went in quest of a fresh stock ; but it was extremely scarce, and at such an extravagant price, that we were discouraged from purchasing any. Although I paid very liberally for my passage, our fare on board was far from being sumptuous. This, however, I little regarded ; but what rendered our meals more than necessarily uncomfortable was, that the captain would never consent to dine in the cabin, but spread a dirty cloth on the deck, with a weight at each corner to prevent the wind, which was frequently very piercing, from blowing it away. We were not provided with chairs, and were obliged to tuck our legs under us, in the Turkish fashion, to accustom us, I suppose, to the manners of the country we were about to visit. At eight o'clock every evening the crew regularly assembled to prayers, at which time I retired to bed by the glimmering of a lamp, for our valiant commander was afraid to trust me with a candle. I used to grumble at first ; but finding that all remonstrance was vain, I bore my misfortunes with tolerable patience, and reconciled matters as well as I could, by firmly resolving, in future, to avoid, if possible, undertaking a voyage in a French merchantman. \n \n [Description of a priest's hospitality.]\n \n The soil, which is naturally fertile, and which formerly yielded in abundance olives, figs, and grapes, is now badly cultivated, and consequently unproductive. In some spots a little cotton is grown, and here and there a field of barley is seen ; but the pasturage is scanty, and the cattle diminutive and lean. \n \n The climate is extremely unhealthy, and the people in general have a sickly appearance. The most prevalent disorders are epidemic fevers and the dropsy, supposed to be generated by the pestiferous influence of the air, and the badness of the water, which is strongly impregnated with sulphur : and such is the ignorance of those who profess medicine, that very little relief is to be expected from the efforts of their skill. \n \n Almost every part of the island furnishes proofs of the vast quantity of mineral substances that is incorporated with the earth. There are several caverns, entirely incrusted with concretions of vitriol and alum, where the heat of the atmosphere is so excessive, that it is impossible to remain in them above two or three minutes. Smoke is frequently seen issuing from the crevices in the soil, which is in a perpetual state of fermentation; and, even on the margin of the sea, in many places, there are springs of water hot enough to boil an egg. The alum has always been held in high estimation, and the salt-pits, which are numerous, produce excellent salt. These two articles constitute the principal traffic of the natives. \n \n [Text goes on about the people.]\n \n There are several chapels and monasteries dispersed over the island, some of which stand in very agreeable situations. The high points of land command various views of the neighbouring islands of Polino, Kimoli, and Siphanto. Of these, the two former are barren and badly peopled: but Siphanto, which is the ancient Siphnos, is happy in climate, fertility, and population. The gold and silver mines, which are so frequently mentioned by the ancients, are either unexplored from the ignorance, or concealed by the prudence, of its present possessors. \n \n The two principal towns, which have by degrees dwindled to villages, do not contain above a thousand or twelve hundred inhabitants, and the deplorable condition of their houses bespeaks their indolence and poverty. One of them, named Castor, stands on the summit of a rugged rock, at the entrance of the harbour, and has a very romantic appearance.",

But the production, for which it is most highly distinguished, is its mastic, which is the finest in the world. This gum distils itself from the lentisque tree, and is considered by the Turks and Greeks, who are continually chewing it, as a strengthener of the stomach, and purifier of the breath. On account of the superior quality of that which is grown on this island, the grand seignor reserves it for the use of himself and the ladies of his harem, and sends, annually, an aga to collect it.

    "Description":"Shortly after passing it, I was gratified with the sight of Smyrna, whose situation, as we approached, I had time to observe, and to admire. It is built on the declivity of a hill, on whose summit are the ruins of a spacious castle, w hich commands every part of the city, and which, if in repair, and properly fortified, might enable it to make a stout defence. On the opposite side, it is washed by the sea, which forms one of the most capacious and beautiful bays In the world. \n \n I had observed In the gulph, and even within a few miles of the harbour, several armed boats, crowded with men, who, on inquiry, I found were Barbary pirates, hovering about, in quest of prey, and watching for an opportunity to surprise some defenceless vessel. I needed no stronger proof to be convinced of the debility and corruption of the Turkish government. \n \n Seven cities dispute the honour of Homer's birth. According to the best founded opinions, Smyrna is alone entitled to the claim. A spot of ground is shewn, on which it is conjectured the school of that divine poet stood, and within whose walls he is supposed to have finished his immortal Iliad. In those days, it might have been insignificant in point of extent and population. Through succeeding ages, the production of perhaps the sublimest genius, that the world ever saw, has been a glorious and enviable distinction. \n \n Smyrna, notwithstanding the various revolutions and disasters which it has experienced, is still a considerable city, being about a mile and a half in length, and nearly of the same breadth. The inhabitants are composed of Turks, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, and Franks, and are computed to amount to about one hundred thousand. \n \n All the Europeans, who are not subject to the grand seignor, are indiscriminately called Franks) and, at present, they consist of British, French, Dutch, Neapolitans, Venetians, and Ragusans, who have each a consul appointed, by their respective states, to watch over the interests of their trade. These consuls are held in high consideration by the Turks ; are allowed janizaries for the defence of their persons; and have even the power of extending their protection to a certain number of individuals who belong to the Turkish government. \n \n The admirable situation of Smyrna, standing on a central point between Constantinople, Aleppo, and Salonica, and the various privileges and immunities which are granted to the Franks, have combined to distinguish it for its commercial spirit, and to render it one of the great marts for almost all the productions of the East. \n \n Since my arrival here, part of my leisure time has been employed in making inquiries concerning the commerce of this extensive empire; and I shall, however irrelevant it may, at first view, appear to female contemplation, take the liberty of communicating the result of them to you. I am sure you will not repent reading it, for commerce in its outline embraces an extensive and noble field for meditation, and must ever be regarded as an object of interest and curiosity by every inquisitive mind. It is the grand machine which stimulates the exertions of industry and genius ; which excites the spirit of enterprise ; and which, by establishing a friendly and lucrative intercourse between independent states, most powerfully conduces to preserve peace, to remove prejudices, to supply mutual wants, to circulate mutual advantages, and to mingle, as it were, into one mass, nations, and languages, and customs. It is, indeed, in every point of view, an important subject for discussion ; and, after what I have premised, I am confident there will be no occasion for further apology. \n \n Considering the local advantages which Turkey possesses ; the difference of its climate ; the extensive course of its numerous navigable rivers ; the immense circuit of its seas ; and the infinite variety of its productions ; it seems to have been designed, by Nature, to take the lead amongst the commercial nations of the world. But, unfortunately, the absurd prejudices of its people, and the odious vices of its government, are at perpetual enmity with progressive improvement, and discourage every description of individual exertion. The despotism and superstition of Turkey arc injurious to its population, to its culture, but, above all, to its trade. Before a man can be prevailed on to engage in any undertaking, which demands the application of industry and genius, and the expenditure of money and time, he first requires a security for the reward of his labours, and an indemnity for the freedom of his actions ; for commerce appears to be that pursuit which thrives least under penalties and restraints. But, in Turkey, where the rich and the poor live in perpetual distrust and hatred of each other ; where intestine broils and jealousies are continually fomenting between the governors and the governed ; where whole provinces are frequently devastated and ruined by the pride and avarice of the pachas ; where there are few conveniences, and but little safety, for the inland transportation of goods ; where bands of ferocious robbers appear in such force, that they can effect their predatory excursions with impunity; where a moral sense of justice acts as no restraint on the conduct of men; and where nothing but strength can insure protection : under all these incumbrances and difficulties, it is, perhaps, more surprising that it should have reached, than that it should not have surpassed, its present extent. \n \n [Text goes on about the inhabitants.]",

They took some little time to consider on the merits of the proposal ; but, as they were unable to conceive how the alteration would promote their interest, they at length resolved to reject it. \n \n [Description of the French Quarter with footnote.]\n \n The moschs, though not splendid, are numerously and the bazar ( In Turkey the shops are not dispersed through the different streets of a town, as with us ; but are collected together in places which are called bazars, or bezestines.) -- is extensive, and well supplied. The harbour is capacious and secure, and exhibits a scene of perpetual bustle and business. It is often crowded with merchantmen from different parts of the globe, and the European powers in amity with the Turks, particularly the English and French, have generally some frigates riding at anchor. The anchorage is good, and the water so deep, that vessels can approach, within a few yards of the wharf, to unload. \n \n The internal government of the city is managed by a sardar who commands the janizaries, and a cadi who administers justice. But the police is very badly arranged, and riots of the most serious nature, which the civil power is unable to repress, frequently occur. Justice is polluted at its very source. The magistracy is entirely under the influence of the opulent, and, if you can afford to bribe the expounders of the law, you may commit any crime with impunity. The Sclavonians resident in this city are very numerous. They are a savage and lawless race, constantly exciting disturbances, and ever disposed to proceed to acts of the most daring and atrocious violence.",

    "Description":"Notwithstanding the high antiquity of Smyrna (Smyrna Is one of the most ancient cities in the world, and was also one of the seven churches of Asia, spoken of in the Apocalypse. The other six were, Ephesus, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Laodicea, and Philadelphia.), it can boast of no monuments of former times, sufficiently respectable either to reward the labours, or stimulate the researches, of curiosity. Scarcely any vestiges of those magnificent temples, amphitheatres, and porticos, which are so frequently the theme of the ancient writers, are now discernible. The castle is only remarkable for its extent, and its situation ; and although there be no certain tradition of the exact time of its elevation, the style of its architecture affords a sufficient proof that it is the production of a barbarous age. Near it, there were formerly some fine ruins of a theatre, which was built of beautiful marble ; but which the Turks have long since completely demolished for the sake of the stone, which was employed in the erection of a bazar and a caravansary. Some trifling remains of a circus, and the skeleton of a church, are still apparent ; and the Greeks, who preserve the memory of St. Polycarp, the first bishop of Smyrna, continue to venerate the spot where his ashes are said to repose. Neither are the environs rendered interesting by many visible marks of the splendour of former times. The aqueduct on the road to Sedequi (a village a few miles from the city) which is evidently some remnant of Roman taste and solidity, is the only remarkable monument now extant.",

The few who recover, after having been afflicted with this excess of the disease, are seldom liable to it a second time. There are, however, now and then, instances to the contrary, which are a sufficient answer to the speculation of those who conceive, that much benefit might result from the practice of inoculation. Not many years back two' Russian doctors were sent, by the empress, to Smyrna, to make their observations on the nature and effects of the plague. They were so confident of their skill, that, when they visited the Greek hospital, in spite of the remonstrances of their friends, they disdained to use any preventive against infection. The consequence was, they both caught the disorder, and died of it in the course of a few days.",

This inconvenience was, however, in great measure, compensated by the elegance and romantic wildness of the views, which were continually engaging our attention. At the foot of this mountain, on a beautiful and extensive plain, watered by the river Hermus, stands Magnesia, which we passed through about mid- day. After the capture of Constantinople by the count of Flanders, John Ducas, the Greek emperor, transferred hither the seat of his empire, and reigned here upwards of thirty years. It was also once the residence of the grand Seignor (Amurat II. and several of his successors, resided in this city. It suffered very much when it was pillaged by Tamerlane after the famous battle of Angora. ), and, although it has dwindled from its former magnificence and importance, is still a large, populous, and flourishing city. It is surrounded by a wall which is in tolerable repair, and, on an eminence to the south, are the ruins of a once formidable castle. This town is remarkable for containing an hospital for lunatics, which, I believe, is almost the only institution of the kind in the empire .\n \n The inhabitants are industrious, and are chiefly supported by the manufacture of cotton yarn, which they carry on to a considerable extent. In ancient history, it is famous for being the spot near which Agesilaus and Tissaphernes, with their numerous armies, contended for the sovereignty of Asia *, and where Antiochus the Great, after an obstinate and bloody battle, was defeated by the Romans f . It is, indeed, surrounded with classic ground, which has been celebrated by the poet as well as the historian. But it has miserably declined from its ancient prosperity. Sardis, Pergamus, Ephesus, and many other places, once so conspicuous for wealth and population, are now reduced to villages, where science is uncultivated, and civilization unknown. \n \n We stopped, about one o'clock, in a field to dine, and, when we were ready to remount our horses, one of the drivers, who was an obstreperous fellow, refused to proceed. He said, that he had no idea of loading and unloading two or three times a day, and we were obliged to threaten him with chastisement, before we could bring him to reason. This point being settled, we resumed our journey, and rode, for several hours, through a barren uncultivated country.",

Scarcely any oxen are to be seen ; and the buffalo, an animal unknown with us, and one of the most hideous productions of nature, is trained to the yoke, and supplies their place. Kircagatch, but a few years ago, was an insignificant village : the rapid increase of its trade has raised it to its present importance. \n \n Cotton has, within the last twenty years, been assiduously cultivated, and is now become an article of such extensive commerce, that it is one of the principal sources of the riches of the country.[Text goes on about cotton.]",

This river is the ancient Rhyndacus, so celebrated for the signal victory which Lucullus gained over Mithridates, and which is so elegantly recorded by the pen of Plutarch. It has also been the scene of many a bloody contest, during the history of the rising empire of the Turks. The town is of considerable extent, and we found the bazar well supplied with a variety of merchandize ; but what surprised me most, was the astonishing number of blacksmiths, whose shops form one of the principal streets, and called to my recollection Virgil's description of the residence of Vulcan (* The shoe of the Turkish horses is unlike that worn by ours. It is a round broad rim of iron, without any break in it.). \n \n The inhabitants of this place are very much distressed for water, which they are obliged to fetch from a great distance, there being no springs in the town, and the river, which flows near it, is so muddy that it is unfit for use. \n \n Having previously satisfied ourselves concerning the absence of the plague, we ventured into a house, and employed a part of our time in allaying our hunger, and recruiting our strength, with an excellent bowl of kimac. \n \n According to agreement, we quitted our horses here, and without any regret, for they were quite overcome with their exertions. It was not, however, without difficulty that we procured others, and several hours elapsed, before we could come to an arrangement about the price. \n \n I had long been anticipating the pleasure of vaulting on a fresh and vigorous steed ; but expectation frequently leads to disappointment; and when I first saw the animal which was allotted to me, I verily concluded, that I should have a considerable portion of the remainder of my journey to perform on foot. It was so supremely ugly, that even the Rosinante of Don Quixote, placed by his side, might have been commended for his beauty and grace. My beast, moreover, possessed a quality in which the courser of that renowned knight was fortunately deficient ; for at times, particularly in the morning, he was so offensive to the nose, that no body would ride near him. This, I believe, was occasioned by a disorder with which several of our horses were afflicted, and which, I imagine, is peculiar to this country ; at least, I never observed it any where else. In many parts of their bodies the blood, in narrow streaks, burst through the skin, and these wounds used to heal and break out afresh, or in other parts, in the course of twenty- four hours. They disfigured the animal a good deal, but did not seem to occasion either pain or inconvenience.",

Contrasted with the scorching heat of the sun, it had produced dreadful effects on our faces, having blistered them terribly, and swelled our noses to an immoderate size. But we suffered most from it at night ; for, in spite of all our precautions, it penetrated our tent, and made us shiver, for hours, after we were in bed. \n \n The janizary and our other attendants used regularly, every morning, to discharge their fire-arms ; and when they were chilled by the keenness of the air, in order to warm themselves, by assisting the circulation of their blood, they would shout for several minutes together. This method of expelling the cold, provoked our laughter at first ; but we afterwards practised it, and found it of some service. \n \n We had a very curious fellow of our party, who was son to one of the muledrivers. He was a young man of eighteen, and, notwithstanding his time of life, and the activity and exertion which his situation seemed to require, he was almost perpetually asleep. I never shall forget the ludicrous figure which he made one morning at breakfast, when his father giving him an egg, he received it, between sleeping and waking, and immediately crammed it into his mouth, without taking off the shell. It kept him employed nearly a quarter of an hour, before he could swallow it, which was no sooner accomplished, than, as if completely exhausted with the exertions, he returned to a state of the most inanimate lethargy. \n \n The favourable alteration in the weather enabled us to examine, and to enjoy, the beauties of the country we passed through. After being on horseback for a few hours we arrived at a lake on whose banks we rode for several miles. It was adorned with numberless islands, which were clothed with wood, and enamelled with the brightest verdure ; and, for several miles round, was exhibited one of the most elegant natural gardens I ever beheld. On every side some pleasing or striking object presented itself, and, towards the north, mount Olympus towered to the skies, and majestically terminated the view. As the road approaches Brusa, it borders on a luxuriant plain, at the nearest extremity of which, there is a large and thick coppice, that furnishes a retreat to thousands of nightingales, which, as if to regale the wearied traveller, chant their melodious notes the whole day long.",

The principal one consists of a spacious hall, with a ceiling formed into three domes, with glass lanterns at top, through which the light is admitted, and, in the centre, an elegant marble fountain is erected, which, through several pipes, pours into a large bason its pellucid and refreshing waters. It is entirely paved with marble, and along the walls, on each side, there is a range of seats covered with mattresses, where we found some smoaking, or drinking coffee and sherbet, and others reposing themselves, after bathing. To the right of this hall, are two passages, one of which leads to the hot, and the other to the cold, bath. Before we arrived at the hot bath, we passed through several rooms of atmospheres, progressively warmer, which obviate the inconvenience of a too sudden change of air. The pavement is heated by subterraneous flews, but the temperature of the water, which is very hot, is not artificial. It is conducted through the walls into the baths, by several leaden pipes, and, from the copperas which adheres to the places whence it issues, is supposed to pass through extensives mines of vitriol. The baths and apartments for the women, are on the opposite side of the hall. \n \n These baths are held in high reputeand their fame attracts invalids from the remotest parts of the empire. In summer time, they are kept open from four in the morning till eight at night, and the usual price is from two to four aspars, or about one penny sterling. The attendants arc numerous, and one of them waits on every bather, who has a great many ceremonies to go through. In the course of the operation, every joint of his body is cracked, even the vertebrae of the back, which is performed with wonderful dexterity. They pressed me very much to try the experiment ; but I felt no inclination to be so roughly handled. Those, however, who are accustomed to it, consider it as a great luxury, and always put on their clothes with reluctance. The women are excessively fond of going to the baths, where they meet old friends, and form new acquaintance ; and where they can always pass their time more pleasantly, and with less restraint, than at home. They frequently remain there for several hours, chatting and embroidering, and refreshing themselves with sherbet and coffee. Ladies of distinction are conveyed thither in the carriages of the country, which are clumsy vehicles, shut up on every side with wooden blinds, that admit a circulation of air without discovering to the inquisitive eyes of passengers the charms of those within. \n \n Besides these baths, the only object that merits attention at Chechlrgui, is the principal mosch, which is a stately building.",

    "PlaceName":"Brusa",

    "NameOfTraveler":"William Hunter",
    "YearOfTravel":1792,
    "Description":"About two o'clock we arrived at Brusa, which is one of the largest and most ancient cities of Asia. Formerly it was the capital of the flourishing kingdom of Bithynia, where the great but unfortunate Hannibal terminated his existence, and where the Romans maintained a long and doubtful warfare with the artful Prusias. It has since been the seat of the Ottoman empire (Brusa was, for a long time, the capital of the Turks. It was besieged, and reduced, by famine, after a tedious blockade, by Orchan, in the year of the Hegira 726 (which was the year i325 of the Christian era), during the reign of his father Olhman I. who was the founder of the Ottoman empire.), and the mausoleums of several sultans (among which is that of Orchan) arc still to be seen. It stands at the foot of Olympus, a mountain of an immense height, which derives its name from the celebrated Olympus in Thessaly, which was feigned by the ancients to be the residence of their gods. At all seasons of the year, its summit is covered with snow ; whilst the lower hills are planted with fir, beech, aspin, yolk-elm, plane, and chesnut trees, and clothed with the brightest verdure. It so abounds with springs, that no city in Turkey is so well supplied with water, almost every house having a fountain, which the Turks reckon among their chief luxuries. These springs swell into the most delightful crystal streams, as they fall into the valley, and abound with trout and other excellent fish ; and the surrounding country is in a high state of cultivation, and covered with vineyards, fruit trees, and luxuriant woods. On the southern side of the city, lies a fertile and extensive plain, planted with mulberry-trees for the nourishment of the silk-worms, which prosper here exceedingly, and produce remarkably fine silk. They are not, however, bred on the trees ; but are kept within doors, where their food is brought to them. \n \n Brusa, thus situated, presents a singular, but beautiful and romantic, landscape. As we approached it, we saw it in various points of view, and the scenery, through all its changes, was either elegant or wild, and always interesting. In some parts, many of the houses are built a considerable way up the mountain, whilst others stand more securely in the valley below : in other parts, the minarets add to the splendour, and the plane-trees to the softness, of the picture. A wall, which is in a ruinous state, surrounds the city, within which none but musslumans are permitted to dwell ; but the suburbs, which are farmore extensive, and infinitely better built and paved, are inhabited by Greeks, Jews, and Armenians. Comprising both, the population is computed to amount to one hundred and thirty thousand souls. They carry on a considerable trade (The caravans from Constantinople and Aleppo to Ispahan pass through Brusa, whence one for Persia sets out every two months. ) in silk, which is exported in the raw state to every part of Europe, and their manufactures in this article, in carpets, in gold, and in velvet brocade, are justly esteemed. Although they have not yet been able, by the assistance of such perfect machinery, to simplify and reduce the exertions of labour with the same success as we, yet the fabric of them is very ingenious, and much taste is displayed in the variety and arrangement of the patterns. \n \n [... silk ...]\n \n The moschs are numerous, and several of them have large domes, covered with lead, and are, in every respect, magnificent structures. The seraglio (There is another seraglio, called the old, which was built by Aniurat I.), which was erected by Mahomet IV. is an extensive edifice, standing on an eminence. It commands a most enchanting prospect, and is inaccessible on every side, but that which leads to the city. The royal colleges, where students are nourished, and instructed in Arabic learning, free of expence, are well endowed, and in high repute. The caravansaries are both handsome and convenient, and the bazar, which occupies a large space of ground, is furnished with all the productions of the Levant, and with many rich and costly articles from the different countries of Europe. The bazars in the East, like Bond-street in London, are the principal lounge of all idle people ; and some of the shops, though in a different style, display nearly as much splendour and taste. Whilst we were walking about in this grand repository of merchandize and wealth, we met the pacha on foot. He was attended by several of his guards, and every body made way for him, as he approached, with the greatest obsequiousness, which he returned with looks of sullen pride and contempt. He, the janizary aga, and the cadi, divide the government of the place. \n \n A Jew, who accosted us shortly after our arrival, and who had politely conducted us about the city, towards the evening, took us to a place where pipes and coffee are provided, and which, on account of its agreeable situation, is much resorted to, during the summer months. To get there, we were obliged to mount a steep ascent, when we were surprised at finding a large plat of ground, neatly laid with turf, and planted with trees. A current of water, which derives its source from an overhanging mountain, passes through it, and, from being confined between two large planks, flows with great impetuosity. Under the shade of these trees, and on the banks of this current, the Turks repose on their carpets, and, with the alternate amusement of a pipe, a cup of coffee, and a nap, contrive to loiter away the day. Of these three indolent occupations, which consume so great a portion of their time, the pipe seems to afford the greatest enjoyment, and their genius has been exerted in the refinement of this luxury. The pipe in the highest estimation has a tube, four or five feet long, one end of which is put into a glass globe, half full of water, and is so contrived, that, as the breath is drawn, the smoke rushes through the water, and is consequently received cool into the mouth. When the water begins to lose its freshness, it is changed, which operation is performed several times, before the tobacco is exhausted. \n \n During the whole of our journey, we had been complaining of the great scarcity of provisions, making sometimes fruitless inquiries, even after bread : and, notwithstanding the population of Brusa, no flesh was to be procured. On asking the reason, of what appeared on the first view so very incomprehensible, I was informed, that, at this season of the year, between the rising and the setting of the sun, scarcely any eatable is ever to be obtained, on account of the ramazan, which is the Turkish lent, and which, although a religious, I will venture to add, is a ridiculous institution. It lasts for four weeks, during which time the order of Nature is completely reversed, and the followers of Mahomet, whilst the day continues, are strictly forbidden to take any kind of sustenance. However violent may be the cravings of an empty stomach, till the sun has sunk below the horizon, they must be endured. Sleep is permitted; but the pipe is a luxury, in which it is unlawful to indulge, and even the use of water is regarded as a criminal excess. These severe and absurd injunctions prove fatal to a number of people, especially to those who are advanced in years. They are, however, relaxed in favour of the sick and travellers, which is a convenient concession for persons who are not over conscientious. But if the law be strictly complied with, those, who, from illness or other reasons, have omitted to fast during the regular period, are not suffered to escape; but are bound to keep an exact account of the days of indulgence, and to submit to the penalty as soon as these obstacles are removed. \n \n The ramazan is the ninth month of the Turkish year, and was ordained by Mahomet himself, who declared it was at that period he received the Koran from heaven. The length of their month being entirely regulated by the moon, this fast consequently falls at different seasons. When it happens in the summer, those, who observe it rigidly, suffer dreadfully from thirst, and wait, with the greatest impatience, for the voice of the muezzins, or criers, who announce, from the minarets, the hour at which it is lawful to take food. Many ascend the highest hills to watch the setting sun, and acclamations of joy attend its departure. As the evening closes in, all kinds of preparations are going forward, to make amends for the abstinence and lingering weariness of the day, and the night is passed in festive jollity, or drunken riot and sensual debauch. This is a season of licence, and, under the certain shadow of darkness, every kind of intemperance is practised with impunity. The bans in the large towns exhibit a curious scene. They are well lighted up, and are crowded with people of all descriptions, who seem to have met with a determination to enjoy themselves. The saturnine disposition of the Turks relaxes into cheerfulness, and hilarity circulates with every testimony of freedom and good-will.",

    "Description":"It was in the reign of the emperor Justinian that the silk-worm was first introduced into Europe. The luxury of the Romans had long since rendered the manufacture an indispensable article of dress, and it was transported, annually, in caravans, from China to the coast of Syria, by a tedious, expensive, and circuitous, route. The Persian merchants, who frequented the fairs of Armenia and Nisibis, delivered it into the hands of the Romans, and reaped considerable benefits from the monopoly of this important and valuable branch of commerce. Two Persian monks, who had resided in China for a length of time, and had observed with attention the management of this remarkable insect, conceived the project of conveying some of the eggs to Constantinople, and, receiving encouragement from the emperor, they evaded the jealous vigilance of the Chinese, by concealing them in the hollow of a cane. Under their direction, on their return, the eggs were hatched, the worms fed, and the race propagated*. Such was the origin of a production, which is now cultivated with success, not only in the Turkish empire, but in many parts of Europe, where it forms one of the principal sources of revenue to the state, and employment to the people.",

    "Description":"The caravansaries, which are erected in all the large towns, and on the principal roads of the empire, are spacious buildings, and generally of a quadrangular form. They have a bench, fixed to the wall on every side, raised a few feet from the ground, and about six feet in width, on which the travellers spread their mattresses ; and the area, in the middle, is occupied by the camels, horses, and mules. Although the caravansaries in this city are on a grand scale, being at this season much occupied, we were so fearful of the plague, that we preferred passing the night in a warehouse ; but we were miserably off, for the fleas, with which it swarmed, so tormented us, that we could get no sleep. The people of the country are not, I fancy, so much exposed to their attacks, for, instead of taking any pains to get rid of them, they seem to encourage their propagation, by covering their floors with mats, which afford them a secure and convenient sheltter. \n \n Shortly after we had taken up our quarters in the warehouse, a man, whom curiosity had induced to pay us a visit, entered, and, being of an inquisitive disposition, soon began to chat with the familiarity of an old acquaintance. We were desirous of amusing him as much as we could, and, after having shewn him a variety of things, Mecherdith, recollecting that I had a bottle of phosphorous, begged I would light a match with it, merely to see what degree of surprise it would occasion. I accordingly dipped one into the bottle, and, on pulling it out, when he first perceived the flame, he had such an aspect of astonishment and fear, that I really believe he suspected the operation was performed by some magical process. To obtain fire from a place in which he had no conception that the element could be confined, confounded his reason, and puzzled his imagination. Having fixed his eyes upon us for about a minute in silent wonder, he expressed a wish to examine the match, which I presented to him. Eager to unravel the mystery, after viewing it in various positions, he at last applied it to his nose ; but was so startled at the effect which the brimstone produced, that he hastily threw it down, appeared tacitly to condemn his thirst after knowledge, and took the first opportunity of stealing out of the room.",

    "Description":"On the 5d of May we proceeded on our journey, and had not travelled many miles, when we were gratified with the sight of one of the most enchanting and finished landscapes, I ever beheld. It consisted of a plain, planted with chesnut, cherry, and mulberry trees, not too confined to destroy its effect, or too extensive for its beauties to be lost. The plantations were arranged with unstudied taste, and the interstices were filled up with parterres of vines, whose prolific branches were trained round the trees. On three sides the view was terminated by lofty mountains, which were cultivated to their very summits, and in many parts adorned with serpentine hedges, composed of jessamy, eglantine, and honey-suckle, which grew in wild luxuriance, and perfumed the air. The plain was intersected by a meandering rivulet, that, enriching and adorning in its course, gently poured its tribute into the sea, by which the fourth side was bounded. The pencil of Claude, wonderful as it is, would have shrunk from all competition before the colouring that was here displayed, and I wish that you, who are a lover of cultivated nature, had been with me to participate my feelings, whilst I ws dweUing on this unrivalled picture. \n \n In the course of the day, we passed an arm of the sea, on the borders of which a few workmen were building a ship of war for the grand seignor. How long it had been on the stocks, I cannot pretend to say ; but it was not in a very advanced state, and, from the slovenly manner in which it was put together, I thought there was some chance of its falling to pieces, before it was completed. Whilst observing it, I could not help reflecting, and with no small degree of pride and satisfaction, on the navy and dock-yards of Great Britain, those grand bulwarks of our strength ! How they would surprise the narrow conceptions of these ignorant and clumsy mechanics ! \n \n We had been ten hours (a tedious length of time) on horseback, when we stopped to dine tinder the shade of a tree, on the banks of a rapid brook, exhibiting no incorrect copy of the simple contrivances of pastoral life.",

It was extremely narrow, and rugged beyond description ; and, in many parts, so thickly overshaded with trees, that it resembled all the horrours of enchantment. The poor horses, which carried our baggage, had many severe falls, and those we rode hardly made a step without stumbling. Like true Englishmen, we scorned all admonition, and, flattering ourselves every moment that the road would mend, we preferred running the risk of breaking our necks to the trouble of dismounting. Had not, however, the obscurity of the night concealed our danger, we should perhaps have been less imprudent.

    "Description":"The inside of Constantinople by no means corresponds with the splendid scene which it presents as you approach it. The streets are narrow and badly paved, and the houses are, in general, of wood, and rudely built. Most of them are two stories high, and have balconies and terraces, where the Turks, in fine weather, smoke their pipes, and drink their coffee. The city is surrounded with a wall, flanked with towers, which is in pretty good repair, but quite unfurnished with artillery. Comprehending the suburbs of Pera and Galata, it is of an immense extent, and is computed to contain upwards of six hundred thousand souls. Being the capital of a rich and populous empire, like all other great cities, it is the seat of profligacy and dissipation, and pre-eminently distinguished for luxury and vice. \n \n When we reflect on the sudden, various, and total revolutions, which this renowned metropolis has undergone; when we recollect, that it was once the receptacle of an undistinguished colony of Greeks ; that it was afterwards created by Constantine the capital of the world, and ordained to rear its lofty head above the majestic walls of Rome ; and that, finally, after arduous and repeated struggles, it was destined to yield to the arms of a barbarian conqueror, and to remain, for so many centuries, in the possession of a race of infidels; we have a most awful and striking lesson, on the insignificance of human grandeur, the instability of fortune, and the folly of reposing, with too much confidence, on the permanency of present strength. \n \n Whilst under the dominion of Constantine and his successors, it had been adorned with some of the choicest productions of art, and, in point of magnificence, even emulated Rome. The wealth, the labour, the genius, of the empire, was employed in the embellishment of the new capital, and what, in consequence of the degeneracy of skill and of taste, these were unable to furnish, was supplied from the scattered remains of a more fortunate and enlightened era. The immortal productions of the Grecian chisel were removed from their ancient abodes, and transported, at an enormous expence, from the most remote provinces, to this favoured spot. Every region was ransacked to contribute to its splendour. Europe, Asia, and Africa were the extensive scene of plunder, and were compelled to deliver up the treasures of art, and even the objects of adoration \"••”. At the time when it was taken, in the fifteenth century, by Mahomet II. many of these noble monuments of human ingenuity and perseverance still existed ; but it was the object and the labour of its new master to mutilate or destroy every vestige, which could convey any idea of the advancement of learning arid the fine arts. It was not, however, one reign which could accomplish this unworthy, this sacrilegious design, and, even to this day, there are some few remains of antiquity to be seen, which are worthy of exciting admiration, and which kindle emotions of pious regret for what has been lost, and can never be restored. \n \n Any monument which, through a long succession of ages, has been an object of curiosity or veneration, is always viewed, by a person of letters, with a mixture of pleasurable sensations, arising from a combination of circumstances which memory arranges in his mind. It is either emblematical of popular superstition, or it records, or corroborates, or explains, some historical fact, or it exhibits a specimen of that sublime genius which was so conspicuous a feature in the works of the ancients.",

    "Description":"The first place we were conducted to, was the Hippodrome, where horse races and other equestrian and athletic amusements were formerly exhibited, and engaged in, by the contending parties, with the most furious animosity. The Turks have, indeed, reserved it for similar purposes, and are very dexterous in the management of their horses, which are surprisingly fleet. Here it is they also frequently practice throwing the jirid, which is one of their favourite diversions, and at which they are astonishingly expert. These entertainments bear a near resemblance to the tournaments which were so much in vogue in the age of chivalry, and the Turks enter completely into the spirit of them. They put their horses on the full gallop ; throw their jirids in the air and catch them with the greatest address ; and pursue each other with the most determined eagerness. They wheel about, retreat, and attack, and go through the various evolutions of horsemanship with wonderful rapidity. When they dart at each other, they generally aim at the back, and the principal skill consists in throwing themselves forward on their horses, and avoiding the meditated blow. But the Hippodrome, although it thus frequently exhibits an animated scene, is stripped of all that magnificence and splendour with which the Greek emperors adorned it, and is now little more than a large irregular square, inclosed with irregular buildings. Near its centre there is an obelisk of porphyry, which is in a perfect state, and, although measuring upwards of fifty feet in height, is of one stone. It was transported from Thebes in Egypt, and the sides of it are covered with hieroglyphics, the mysterious symbols of that once celebrated country. It rests on four brazen balls, supported by a well proportioned pedestal, on which there are various clumsy bas-reliefs, and inscriptions, both in Greek and Latin (These inscriptions are now scarcely legible.), mentioning,that it was restored by Theodosius to its present condition. \n \n At a small distance from this obelisk, there is a very lofty column, which, from its mutilated appearance, bears the marks of remote antiquity. It is composed of several blocks of marble, and has suffered very seriously from the rough treatment it received when it was pillaged of the plates of gilded bronze with which it was formerly covered. In the time of the Greek emperors, it was the farthest goal of the Hippodrome, and the inscription on the base speaks of the workmanship of it in terms of high panegyric. \n \n The famous brazen triple serpent of which Mahomet II. broke one of the heads (The other two heads have since disappeared.), when he triumphantly entered the city, still continues to attract strangers to the Hippodrome, and to remind them of the foolish arrogance of that haughty despot. Exasperated at the long and vigorous defence that had been made, he regarded this inoffensive serpent as a talisman, which had inspired resistance to his arms, and, for such a length of time, rendered his efforts ineffectual. When it was in his power, he accordingly took his impotent revenge. This remarkable pillar is very ancient, and is said to have been brought from Delphi, where it served to support the celebrated tripod of gold, formed out of a part of the immense treasures found in the camp of Mardonius, and which the Greeks, after the battle of Plata, consecrated to Apollo.",

They produce a grand effect, standing in spacious courts, which are ornamented with trees and fountains, and the accesses to them are convenient and good. They have each several domes, and from one to six or seven minarets, which are high slender towers with two or three outside galleries, whence the muezzins, turning with solemnity to the four quarters of the globe, in an audible voice, proclaim the hours of prayer, and admonish the people to assemble. Great attention is paid to their preservation and cleanliness. They are kept in excellent repair, and many of them are maintained at an enormous expence. Of these moschs, which are extremely numerous (There are said to be upwards of two thousand moschs at Constantinople. ), seven, by way of pre-eminence, are distinguished by the title of royal moschs ; and of these again, St. Sophia is, in every respect, the most magnificent and remarkable.

    "Description":"Of these moschs, which are extremely numerous (There are said to be upwards of two thousand moschs at Constantinople. ), seven, by way of pre-eminence, are distinguished by the title of royal moschs ; and of these again, St. Sophia is, in every respect, the most magnificent and remarkable. I shall, therefore, endeavour to give you a description of it. \n \n This celebrated temple stands on the ruins of a church of the same name, which was burnt during the memorable sedition of the N'tka, and employed, for the space of nearly six years, the hands of ten thousand workmen. It was erected by Justinian, and dedicated by him to the service of the true God; and, although defaced in many parts, and divested of those costly ornaments which once adorned it, is still a superb edifice. When Mahomet II. entered the city, he was so struck with the majesty of its appearance, that he allowed it to escape the ravages of his exterminating hand, and converted it into a place of religious worship for his followers. It is built in the form of a Greek cross, and the entrance is through a double portico, which, by means of several folding doors of bronze covered with bas-reliefs, communicates with the body of the church. The inside consists of an immense lie, three sides of which are encompassed with a gallery, supported by sixty seven variegated marble pillars. The principal dome, which measures one hundred and thirteen feet in diameter, is constructed on arches which repose on four colossal columns, and is much admired for its gentle concavity, and the justness of its proportions. The roof is worked in mosaic, the walls are entirely encrusted with marble, and the pavement and stairs, which are covered with carpets, are of the same expensive material. We were only permitted to take a view of this church from a part of the gallery, through a lattice. Several Turks were at prayers, although no person was officiating ; some quite motionless, whilst others entertained us with a variety of violent and extravagant gesticulations. Near the middle of the ile, a pulpit is erected for the mufti, and, beyond it, stands a kind of pew with a gilded lattice, which is appropriated to the grand seignor, when he honours this mosch with his presence. The nich, in which the Koran is deposited, always faces the holy city of Mecca, towards which the mussulmans turn, whenever they repeat their prayers. The Turks ornament the walls of their moschs with moral distichs of Arabian poetry and passages from the Koran, which are written in letters of gold ; but, considering an attempt to represent the human form as a criminal presumption, they neither admit statues nor paintings. Women are also excluded from the moschs, from a fear of their engrossing too much of the attention of the men, which is so frequently the case at our own churches, where a pair of fine eyes is apt to relax the fervour of devotion, and to render us totally forgetful of the moral lessons of the preacher. The man who conducted us through the gallery (and who had made us pay pretty handsomely for his trouble*), desired us to remark two stone gates, one of which, he said, led to paradise, the other to the infernal regions. He also, with a sarcastic smile, pointed out a cross, which is represented in mosaic on one of the walls, and is a remnant of the Greek ornaments. There are, indeed, several remains of mosaic . pictures to be seen in different parts ; but the Turks, taking no pains to preserve them, they are falling fast to decay. They are made of a curious composition of a vitrified nature, and the colours, which are of numerous shades, retain their original lustre. \n \n Such are the principal relicks of the former magnificence of Constantinople, once renowned for laws and arms, once the abode of the sciences and arts, once unrivalled in riches, in elegance, and splendour, the envy of surrounding nations, and the astonishment of an admiring world.",

    "PlaceName":"The seraglio",
    "PlaceNameModern":"Topkapi Palace Museum (Topkapı Sarayı Müzesi), İstanbul",
    "NameOfTraveler":"William Hunter",
    "YearOfTravel":1792,
    "Description":"When we reached the seraglio, the sultan (The name of the present emperor is Selim III. He succeeded to the throne of his ancestors on the 6th of April 1789.) was on his return, which is an exact repetition of the ceremony when he goes. My expectations had been considerably raised by an ideal contemplation of the pompous train of an oriental monarch, and, as is generally the case, when the reality was presented to my senses, my disappointment was proportionable : for, after having seen the splendid processions of the other parts of Europe, certainly those of the Turkish emperor are not calculated to produce much surprise. \n \n Before his arrival, a number of his attendants were continually riding in and out of the seraglio, in a disorderly manner. Sometimes twenty or thirty succeeded, two abreast, when the line was abruptly broken off, and quite discontinued for a few minutes, at the expiration of which, it recommenced. The captain of the janizaries, the chief of the eunuchs, and several of the other great officers of state attended. Their horses were richly caparisoned, and adorned with gold chains and other rich trappings, some of which were curiously embossed, and studded with precious stones : but their own robes, though costly, being lined with furs of great value, were rather plain than brilliant. As they passed they were saluted by the janizaries, a rank of whom was stationed on each side. Their manner of salutation is remarkable, and exhibits a disgusting picture of Eastern servitude and humility. They incline their heads to one side, exposing their bare necks, and intimating, by this gesture, that their lives are at the entire disposal of these supercilious tyrants. How the character of man shrinks from the dignity which nature meant it to assert in the scale of creation, when it submits to such demonstrations of ductile imbecility and timid baseness ! They were very shabbily clothed, but as they receive hardly any pay from their master, they, poor fellows ! were excusable. The sultan did not appear till near the close of the procession. The turban of state was carried before him, and he was surrounded by about thirty pages on foot, who wore caps ornamented with immense plumes of feathers, thickly planted, and extended in the the shape of a fan. He is rather a handsome man, about thirty years of age, and was mounted on a beautiful Arabian steed. \n \n [Fn: * There are no carriages in Constantinople, and the sultan generally goes about the city on horseback. — When he takes a ride a few miles into the country, he is attended by a numerous guard, which is very diligent in keeping the road clear from the intrusion of strangers. His horses are brought from Arabia and the remotest provinces of the empire, and are purchased at a great expence. ]\n \n He looked remarkably grave, and noticed nobody. The janizaries repeated their salutation both to the turban and the emperor as they passed. \n \n The seraglio, which was begun by Mahomet II. is a vast but inelegant pile of stone buildings, situated on a point of land which runs into the sea, and which is the spot where formerly flourished the city of Bysantium. It is inclosed by high walls, which are said to be nearly three miles in circumference, and is enlivened with gilded spires and turrets, and a multitude of small domes which are rooted with lead. Including the haram, it consists of twelve courts, which have been erected at different periods, and according to the various tastes of the reigning princes; so that but little attention, if any, has been paid to uniformity, or the common rules of architecture. The apartments are spacious and richly furnished, though not in a manner that would correspond with our ideas of taste. They are chiefly ornamented with Turkish inscriptions; aphorisms in Arabic; pictures gaudily and coarsely executed; fountains, marble basons, sofas, baths, and the presents which have been made by the ambassadors from foreign courts, such as mirrours, vases, carpets, and other kinds of household furniture. The upper apartments are occupied by the women, and have domes with golden crescents, cabinets, balconies, galleries, and terraces. \n \n The gardens, which are reserved for the sultan and his ladies, are of considerable extent, planted with cypresses and other evergreens, and adorned with, parterres of flowers, fountains, alcoves, and chiosks. \n \n These chiosks, which are very numerous in Turkey, are a kind of pavilion, raised a few feet from the ground, and open on every side, to admit a free circulation of air. Many of them are fitted up at an enormous expcncc, being paved and incrusted with the most precious marbles, and embellished with magnificent fountains, painted ceilings, embroidered sofas, and rich carpets. They are generally, when the situation admits of it, erected on the borders of rivers or lakes, and most of the opulent Turks have them in their gardens, where they sleep in the summer time after >dinner, or sit chatting with their women, enjoying their conversation, and the coolness of the evening breeze. \n \n The principal entrance into this remarkable palace is through a large gate, whence the title of the Sublime Porte originates. It is very lofty, and arched at top; and, on each side, are several windows intermixed with Arabian inscriptions. About four hundred porters keep guard at the different gates, of whom forty or fifty are stationed at this. These are the ministers of vengeance whom the sultan dispatches to his provinces for the heads of those governors, who have disobeyed his orders, or disappointed his expectations. \n \n Of the twelve courts, strangers are only admitted into the two first, which are subdivided into, the offices for the residence of the menial servants ; an infirmary for the sick, where the most expert physicians and surgeons regularly attend ; the stock of wood for the consumption of the palace ; the kitchens, which form a long range, and have domes with holes in the centre to let out the smoke ; a small stable where those horses are kept which are reserved for the emperor's particular use ; the divan ; the treasury ; and the mint. The second court is better paved, and, in every respect, much handsomer than the first, being laid with turf in the middle, embellished with fountains, and surrounded with a gallery which is supported by pillars of marble. The divan, where the foreign ministers receive their public audiences, and deliver their credentials and presents, previous to their admission to the sultan, is nothing more than a large hall, lined with wainscoting. Here it is that the grand vizir presides as judge, and determines all civil and criminal causes. He convenes a court four times a week for the dispatch of business, and every subject of the empire, even the meanest, has the privilege of being heard. But, as trials are determined very rapidly ; as little trouble is taken to investigate the truth ; as the testimony of any witness is admitted ; as the rich, in every country, discover their influence ; and as there is no appeal from the decision of the judge ; the innocent and the guilty are frequently confounded together ; and it is but seldom that strict and impartial justice is administered. On points of religion or affairs of conscience, the vizir applies to the mufti, who is always present, and is guided by his advice. In the provincial towns, the cadis are invested with nearly a similar extent of juridical authority ; but as their integrity is more exposed to the allurements of a bribe, and the effects of prejudice are felt in greater force, the source of justice is still more corrupt. Neither the religious orders nor the janizaries are amenable to the ordinary courts, but have their own separate tribunals. Our conductor, among other curiosities, pointed out to us the place where the grand vizir's head is generally exposed, after deposition. At this moment that important but perilous office is vacant. The last who filled it was an able and popular man ; but, through the cabals and intrigues of his enemies, he was lately dismissed, and another is not yet appointed to succeed him. The almost invariable rule of decollation was waved in his favour, and he has been permitted to retire ; but, being very rich, he is perhaps reserved for a day of future necessity. \n \n [The text continues on about the government.]",

It is a large square structure, neatly paved with flat stones, and covered with domes, which are sustained by arches and pilasters. Merchants are drawn from the most distant parts of the empire to make purchases at this grand repository, which is also the receptacle of half the idle people of the city, who keep sauntering about for hours, drinking coffee and sherbet, and examining and cheapening goods. The shops, which are placed in front of the warehouses, are furnished with all kinds of merchandize, are kept very clean, and most of them are ornamented with gilding and paint. Each distinct trade is carried on in a separate quarter, and the jewellers, embroiderers, and cutlers, make a splendid appearance. The arts, in their present state, nearly correspond with the descriptions that have been given of them centuries ago. They evince, no spirit of emulation, no desire of improvement, no love of novelty. If a Turk can imitate what has been performed by his predecessor, he is perfectly satisfied with his exertions, and attempts nothing further. Thus they never vary their utensils, their machinery, or their patterns ; but, pursuing the road which was opened to them by their ancestors, they copy, with the same servility, their discoveries and their defects. \n \n [Text desrcribes the slave market and male treatment of women.]\n \n I had almost forgotten to mention that on our return from the bazar, we were obliged to take off our coats, and to have them exposed, for a few hours, in the open air, to purify them from any infection which might have adhered to them.

This building is said to have been raised to the memory of the untimely fate of that adventurous youth. But those who thus named it were probably unacquainted with the story, or had forgotten that it was across the Hellespont (From Abydos to Sestos. See Ovid. Ep. 18 and 19. ) Leander used to swim, when he paid his nocturnal visits to the beautiful Hero. The fact is, it was erected by the emperor Manuel, and is supposed to have corresponded with another tower, from which chains were formerly extended to the coasts, to block up, in cases of emergency, the passage of the canal. The distance between the opposite shores, in this part, does not exceed five hundred paces, and it was here that Xerxes constructed his bridge of boats, for the passage of his immense but pusillanimous army.",

    "Description":"Not being favoured by the wind, we were obliged to row the whole way, and above three hours had elapsed before we reached Bujukderé. This, however, was a detention which I did not at all regret, as it afforded me an opportunity of examining, at my leisure, this boasted spot, and of dwelling on those beautiful landscapes which successively presented themselves as we advanced. \n \n We had been politely invited by Mr. Abbott to remain at his house, till we embarked on board our Greek vessel, in which we were to accompany Mr. Vanderschroef, a Dutch merchant, removing with his wife and family to Buchorest. We purposed to go by way of the Black sea, and, mounting the Danube as far as Galatz, to proceed thence to Buchorest by land. This appeared to be a more eligible plan, than encountering the danger and fatigue of travelling on horseback to Scmlin; yet could I possibly have foreseen what time has disclosed, I am doubtful whether I should not have preferred the latter route. \n \n Shortly after our arrival at Bujukderé, we waited on Mr. Vanderschroef to know when he had determined to embark. He replied, the moment the wind became favourable ; but that there was little chance of its changing that night. After such an answer, we went to bed, at our usual hour, with apparent security. About two o'clock in the morning, however, we were awakened out of a sound sleep, by a violent knocking at our chamber door, and the vociferation of a person, with whose voice we were totally unacquainted. I had quite forgotten where I was, and could not conceive the reason of such an untimely disturbance. At last, I thought I heard the name of Vanderschroef, which brought to my recollection all that had passed. We immediately jumped out of bed, and, hastily dressing ourselves, ran down stairs. We were in a great hurry and very impatient to be gone, but, as fate would have it, the key of the street door was missing, and the servants were searching above half an hour for it, before they could find it. We were, nevertheless, detained at Vanderschroei's a considerable time, and did not get under weigh till after five o'clock. \n \n Bujukderé is but a few miles from the entrance of the Euxine, to guard -which, several fortresses are erected on either shore, which, if kept in proper repair, and well supplied with men and ammunition, might set at defiance the attack of almost any force. Baron de Tott employed his genius in strengthening this important pass, and a castle on the Asian coast was pointed out to us, which was built after a plan submitted by him to the Turkish government. \n \n Bujukderé is but a few miles from the entrance of the Euxine, to guard -which, several fortresses are erected on either shore, which, if kept in proper repair, and well supplied with men and ammunition, might set at defiance the attack of almost any force.

    "Description":"The Euxine, or Black sea, is about two hundred leagues in circumference, and may be compared to an immense lake. It is the receptacle of several of the largest rivers in Europe ; and as the canal of Constantinople, which is a very narrow strait, is the only visible outlet, many naturalists have been puzzled to account for its stationary appearance, whilst others have been of opinion, (and the opinion appears a very probable one) that its superfluous waters are carried off by means of subterraneous channels. Although we did not find it correspond exactly with the description the ancients have given of it, yet making allowance for the apprehensions of the \n \n Argonauts, and the dissatisfaction of Ovid, we shall not be far removed from the truth. At least, whilst we were on it, it was extremely boisterous, the sky was obscure, and the weather cold. Till lately it was entirely under the dominion of the grand seignor, and no vessel coilld navigate on it without his permission, which was very cautiously granted ; but the possession of the Crimea by the northern empress, has deprived him of this exclusive right, and will probably lead to more important consequences. \n \n Till two in the afternoon, I had felt no disagreeable effects from the motion of the vessel ; and, as I had lately performed a long voyage, I was beginning to flatter myself that I should altogether escape. \n \n Shortly after that hour, however, some unfavourable symptoms betrayed themselves, and, in the course of a few minutes, I was seized with a deadly sickness, which continued with increasing violence till three the next morning, when it fortunately began to abate. Never do I remember to have passed so wretched a night. The cabin being small, and Vanderschroef's family numerous there was no birth for us in it. We were therefore obliged to seek for shelter elsewhere. On inquiry, we found that there was no choice, and the only place kept vacant for us was at the head of the vessel, where there was a hole, (scarcely a fit residence for a dog) one half of which was allotted as the temple of repose for my brother and myself. When lying, we were so cramped for room, that it was quite a labour to turn, and the roof was so low, we could not even sit upright. The only light and air we received were admitted through the opening by which we entered, and which was so small, that before sickness had worn us down, and practice rendered us expert, we ran the risk of sticking by the way. Our ingress and egress that night were perpetual. When I returned, I generally perceived my brother, with his head and shoulders out, inquiring with earnestness if the weather were mending, and telling me, with a mournful countenance, that he' was preparing for another sally. These complicated misfortunes were not a little aggravated by the dreadful noise which the sailors unceasingly made with their voices and violins. I absolutely thought they would have driven me to distraction, and often wished for a little English discipline to keep these fellows to their duty, for they were inconceivably lazy, and under no kind of subordination. We would willingly have remained all night on deck ; but the sea (which in these parts is generally much agitated; was so tempestuous, that we should, in all probability, have been washed overboard ; and the consolations of hope, you know, dispose us to consider lite as worth preserving, even under the burden of the deepest afflictions. Our situation would have furnished some laughable scenes to the pencil of Bunbury ; but we were too much weakened, and too immediately concerned, to enjoy them ourselves.",

He told us, there was a Turkish village about half a mile from the shore, to which Vanderschroef repaired the day after our arrival, not forgetting our firman (This is a paper, corresponding to the passport of Christian countries.). On his return, he informed us, that he had secured several carts and oxen, which would be ready for us the next morning. This piece of intelligence was received with universal joy, and on the 18th we accordingly disembarked.

    "Description":"Bulgaria formerly constituted a part of the kingdom of Hungary ; but it was subdued by Amurat II, and has since then been annexed to the Turkish empire. The southern parts of it contain a few considerable towns, of which Sophia is the metropolis, and the residence of the beglerbeg, or viceroy, of Romelia. \n \n The accommodations for travelling in this country are, beyond all description, deplorable, and the badness of the weather was no small addition to our other distresses; for our vehicles were in such a crazy condition, and so open on every side, that, notwithstanding we wrapped ourselves up as warmly as possible, we were very little protected from its inclemencies. \n \n These vehicles, called by the people of the country arabàs, were long narrow carts, without springs, and covered with mats, which were quite rotten and full of holes. In order to be as comfortable as we could, we used to lay one mattress under us, and cover our baggage (which we piled up behind us, so as to make a support for our backs) with the other. We then placed ourselves side by side ; but were so stinted for room, that this position, although the most eligible, was by no means a pleasant one. Our driver was seated in the front of the cart between our legs, and was in one respect of some utility ; for, being a lusty fellow, he blocked up a considerable gap, and excluded no small portion of cold wind. He possessed, what is ironically termed, a plentiful stock of modest assurance, and, whenever he felt himself cold, without any ceremony, would struggle hard to wriggle himself into the cart. Being, however, sufficiently squeezed without him, we never allowed him to succeed ; but, not understanding his language, wx were obliged, in our own defence, to have recourse to a method still more effectual, and to resist his encroachments with our feet. \n \n Our oxen went at the rate of about three miles an hour : and, as they were not changed on the road, they could not travel above six or seven hours out of the four-and-twenty, so that we did not advance very expeditiously. Their owners were not at the trouble or expence of providing forage for them ; but, when they were fatigued, would unyoke them, and turn them out to graze on whatever the country afforded. \n \n Whilst we were on this road, we had a striking instance of the irascible and revengeful disposition of the Turks. Two of our guides had had a difference of opinion on some trivial subject. The debate soon grew warm, and, in the course of a few minutes, they drew their knives, and began a furious attack, which, in all probability, would have terminated in some fatal catastrophe to the parties, had we not been present. We immediately interposed, but had great trouble in separating, and much more in pacifying, them. \n \n The villages we passed through were wretched in the extreme, and plainly demonstrated the effects of a corrupt and tyrannic government ; for although our firman secured to us the best lodging which each place furnished, we never ventured to expect any thing half so comfortable as an English barn. More than once we were all obliged to sleep in the same apartment, which was so small, that every inch of the ground was covered with our mattresses, and we could scarcely move, without making invasions on a neighbour's territory. There were several ladies with us, to whom a situation of this kind must have been extremely inconvenient ; yet a room thus inhabited, displayed a scene so novel and so truly ridiculous, that, the first time we were witnesses to it, we could not get to sleep for laughing. \n \n Whenever we had the good fortune to meet with a fire-place, it was sure to be in the middle of the room, with a hole in the roof to let out the smoke ; but which answered so badly the purpose for which it was contrived, that the moment our victuals (when we had any) were dressed, we extinguished the fire, preferring to suffer from cold to the risk of being stifled by the gross vapours which issued from half-dried wood. \n \n [Text goes on about the people. Trigger warnings.]\n \n During the war, this unfortunate country was completely drained of its wealth by the pacha and other people in power, and the contributions which were levied on these miserable villages were, to the last degree, excessive. One in particular, called Cajarmari, where there are only eight hovels, and where the majority of the inhabitants has only a coarse shirt to veil their nakedness, paid annually, one thousand piastres; a sum so far beyond their ability to support, that it wrested from them every comfort of existence, and reduced them to a state of the most abject poverty and distress. Who can listen to a tale of such villany and persecution, without giving way to emotions of indignation and horrour ? Let us not, therefore, attribute that savageness of character, which I have already remarked, to any natural defect of disposition, but rather to the unrelenting cruelty and oppression of their insolent rulers : for human nature, when harassed by continual aggravation, loses, by degrees, all its mildness and benevolence, and necessarily engenders the seeds of distrust and revenge. Though frequently crushed to submission, the innate love of liberty still exists, and the delusive persuasions of hope will, at intervals, rouse it to activity. Anxious for redress, and panting with eagerness, for emancipation, if an opportune moment arrive, whilst the transitory flame of irritated passions animates the breast, we are not to be surprised, if it endeavour to assert its rights, and to retaliate those injuries by which it has been aggrieved. A propensity to hate our enemies, and to avenge the wrongs they have inflicted on us, is a principle which is coeval with the instinctive feelings of the human frame. It has an eternal basis m nature, and prevails throughout the extent of the animal creation. It is a fundamental law which is universally established in the breast, and is neither to be subverted by sophistry, nor invalidated by persuasion, nor extirpated by power. \n \n The country is remarkably level, and we traversed immense plains, so small a portion of which is cultivated, that the labours of the plough are almost unknown. They consist chiefly of pasture land, and the little grain that is raised, is of such an indifferent quality, that it is hardly fit for use. These plains stretch, with little interruption, from the foot of mount Haemus, to the banks of the Danube, and have been the theatre of several desperate conflicts between the enterprising and irresistible Attila and the degenerate soldiers of Theodosius. \n \n The climate is cold, and must be extremely unfavourable to vegetation, for scarcely a tree is any where to be seen; but the cattle, such as horses, cows, and sheep, though not abundant, is healthy and strong.",

    "Description":"On the 18th, at two o'clock, we reached a village on the banks of the Danube, which we, of course, concluded was very near Galatz. Shortly after our arrival, however, as we were congratulating ourselves on the approaching termination of this irksome journey, one of our company, who had been chatting with the villagers for the sake of information, approached, and, with a disconsolate countenance, told us, that our guides had mistaken the road, and, instead of conducting us to the place that was opposite Galatz, had carried us about forty leagues higher up the river. This intelligence was enough to ruffle even the resigned temper of a stoick. Had we been travelling through. an interesting country, I should not perhaps have repined : but, when I considered that we had been traversing some thousand acres of waste land which presented nothing to the view but a few ruined villages, where desolation holds its dreary and solitary sway; when I reflected, moreover, on the loss of time we had incurred, and the fatigue we had undergone ; that we had neither been enriched by the stores of knowledge, nor delighted by the charms of amusement ; I confess that I was thoroughly discontented. Here it was, we had ample reason to lament having left our trunk on board the Greek vessel : we might, otherwise, by crossing the Danube, have proceeded to Buchorest in a direct line. \n \n Rassovat (the name of this village) was formerly respectable for its extent and population, and the ruins of several hundred houses which surround it, made me lament its present insignificance. Destitute of every thing that can render life comfortable, it only offers to the view a few huts, corresponding with the manners of their tenants, which hardly rise above the condition of savage life. They all appear to be half- starved, and are subject to fevers and a variety of other complaints, occasioned by the badness and scantiness of their nourishment. Yet so great is the vanity of mankind, and so desirous, in every situation, is one person of distinguishing himself above another, that even in this obscure corner of the earth, where one would imagine, from the description, that extreme poverty had levelled all notions of distinction, and crushed the aspiring sentiments of emulation, children are seen, with their caps loaded with pieces of money, whilst both themselves and their parents are suffering from the denial of food. Almost every scene of life is capable of furnishing instruction, and never was the folly of ostentation more forcibly conveyed to my mind. \n \n After an infinite deal of trouble, by the authority of our firman, we at last procured a lodging, which consisted of two adjoining rooms, heated by the same stove. It had not a very inviting appearance yet we consoled ourselves with the expectation of a sound sleep, and the hope of recruiting our strength by a short remission from the fatigues of travelling. But when the hour of repose came, we found that imagination had been much too fervent, and had only been amusing us with visionary ideas ; for the rooms, which were thatched with rushes, swarmed so astonishingly with fleas and muschetoes, that, during the two nights we passed here, I had not so much as one hour's sleep. Nothing but actual experience can enable us to form any just and definite notion of the misery to which mankind is often subjected; nor without the conviction, which that stern monitor uniformly enforces, could I have conceived, that we should one day be reduced to such a deplorable situation, as to lament the privation of our hole on board the Greek vessel, and to confess that there were abodes on earth, to which that dungeon was a luxury.",

Valens, who at that time was, unfortunately, seated on the throne, after some hesitation, at last consented to receive them into the territories of Thrace. Near a million of these barbarians crossed the river, and laid the foundation of those rapid conquests which accelerated the subversion of the Eastern empire. \n \n The face of the country, to the west of Rassovat, is much more diversified and interesting than that which we had passed through. In many parts, it is very wild and romantic, and, although but badly cultivated, wears the cheerful countenance of fertility, and abounds with agreeable landscapes. The Danube, which flows in a very serpentine direction, and is decorated with several islands which are well stocked with timber, adds considerably to the life and beauty of the surrounding scenery. Some few flocks of sheep arc bred on the neighbouring mountains. They produce a fine wool, that is spun, and manufactured into a stout cloth by the inhabitants, and proves a useful commodity in a country, where the climate is cold, and which, having no opportunity of intercourse with other places, is entirely dependent on itself. \n \n One would conceive that in such a situation, where nature has not been very sparing of her bounties ; where the soil is generous ; where there is no want of fuel ; and where the noblest river in Europe is at hand; that there could not be many sound reasons of complaint. Yet the misery of the people is excessive. Systematic tyranny and oppression have so slackened every nerve of the body, and so cramped every energy of the mind, that they seem totally indifferent about life, and waste their time in the murmurs of idle complaint, or the listlessness of insurmountable inactivity. They used in the evening to assemble round our door, and to relate to us, in the expressive language of deep-felt grief, the hardships to which they had been exposed from the unrelenting cruelty and profligate avarice of their rulers. Their property had been pillaged, their houses dismantled, their persons insulted. Many had fled their homes to save the wreck of their fortune : those who remained had nothing more to lose. The scourge of despotism had been every where applied, and its consequences were every where evident. \n \n The manner in which the people of the country navigate their boats is rather curious. In each boat there is seldom more than one man, who is furnished with a piece of wood in the form of a battledore, with a long handle (something like the paddle of the Indians) which he shifts about with wonderful dexterity, employing it one moment as an oar, the next as a rudder. The river being wide, and the stream rapid, it was quite an entertainment to observe their different manoeuvres, when they wanted to gain the opposite shore. It was a task of no small difficulty ; and, in spite of all their skill and good management, before they could accomplish it, they were frequently carried out of a direct line a full quarter of a mile.",

    "Description":"On the 20th, to our great joy, we embarked on board our boat for Galatz, which, had the wind favoured us, we might easily have reached the next morning by day-break. But, as usual, it was directly contrary, and, although we were assisted a good deal by the current, before we had proceeded far, it blew with such violence, that the sailors could no longer manage the boat with their oars. We were therefore obliged to come to anchor. What followed was in exact unison with this ominous outset, and, in this manner, our efforts were frustrated for two tedious days ; quitting our anchorage as the wind abated, and having recourse to it again as it increased. These frequent, and, apparently, increasing difficulties, so unnerved every active principle of enjoyment, that we had scarcely power left to admire the diversified landscapes, which opened upon us as we descended the river, and which were certainly capable of raising, in the minds of less dissatisfied spectators, the most pleasurable ideas. Water, land, and wood, blended together, with all the charms of nature and graces of variety, and viewed through the numerous changes of light and shade which the two great luminaries of the earth were alternately affording, were no common objects ; but we were so discontented that we could relish nothing. When our men were tired with rowing, we used to go ashore, and wander in the woods, collecting wild flowers ; or sit down among the rushes, and endeavour, by conversation, to mitigate the poignancy of present affliction, and banish the remembrance of past disappointment. We had advanced so little, that we began to apprehend we should be at least a week on the Danube, when, on the 2nd in the morning, the storm ceasing, we took advantage of a dead calm, and, by dint of hard rowing, at six o'clock in the evening arrived at Ibrail. \n [Description of Ibrail and festival.]\n \n That you may form a just idea of our sufferings the two preceding days, I will describe that part of the boat which was allotted to passengers. It was about twelve feet long and six wide, and was covered with an awning to keep out the rain. In this confined space, seventeen people, extended on mattresses, were destined to remain, night and day, in the same position. A slave captain, who had been torturing his mind half his life, to contrive the most convenient and economical plan of packing negroes, could not, I suppose, have squeezed us into a smaller compass ; and our situation suggested to me, more than once, the hard fate of those unhappy people. At night, when, to exclude the damp air, it was closed at each end, it was just like a furnace, and we were absolutely almost suffocated with each other's breath.",

    "Description":"Ibrail is a place of some consequence. It is large, well built, and pleasantly situated ; and the castle, which stands on an eminence, is commanded by a pacha of three tails. This is a title of high distinction in Turkey, and derives its origin from the following occurrence. A Turkish general, who had lost all his standards, and whose troops were giving way on every side, suddenly ran up to a horse, and, cutting off his tail, fastened it to the end of a lance, and elevated it in the air. This romantic act, worthy of the times of chivalry, produced such an effect on his soldiers, that they instantly rallied, and fought with such determined valour, that they soon retrieved their misfortune, and gained the victory. Since that period the title has existed, and lances, to the points of which are fixed horses' tails, are carried before those invested with the dignity. \n \n As we purposed remaining here all night, I was desirous of walking up and down the beach till the dawn of day; but being informed that it would be dangerous, as there was a number of villains generally lurking about, I was prevailed on, when it grew dark, to return on board. Sooner, however, than undergo what I had endured the preceding nights from the complicated miseries of confinement, heat, muschetoes, and fleas, I laid myself down on that part of the boat which, in the day-time, was occupied by the rowers, with nothing but some uneven planks for my bed, and the heavens for my covering. This was not, you will say, a very enviable place of rest, yet, comparatively speaking, it had its advantages, and, when contrasted with the post I had abandoned, was even capable of furnishing some comforts. \n \n [Text goes on to describe \"Rejoicings there on account of the termination of the ramazan\"]",

    "Description":"[Tigger waring for description of war.]\n Galatz is the last place of consequence on the southern side of Moldavia, and, like most of the other towns in the prince's territories, has been desolated by the iron hand of war. It was surrendered to the Russians about two years ago, after an obstinate battle, in which the greatest part of the Turkish army (consisting of eight thousand men, sent by the Porte to insure a successful resistance) was left dead on the field. \n \n When the Russians entered the town, flushed with victory, and exasperated at the stubborn and unexpected resistance that had been made, they committed cruelties, which would reflect disgrace on any nation, or on any age (Kamenskoi, who led on the Russian troops, was, even among the Russians, noted for barbarity. ). Instead of testifying that respect to which a vanquished enemy is entitled, after having nobly fought in defence of their liberties and their country ; instead of rewarding those deeds of valour and patriotism, which, whatever may be the fortune of war, always kindle, in the bosom of a true soldier, the generous sentiments of compassion and esteem ; the licentiousness of the troops was suffered to rage without restraint. The four corners of the town were fired ; the women were torn from the protection of their fathers and husbands ; many of the inhabitants were wantonly massacred in cold blood; the churches were broken open, plundered, and otherwise profaned (Some of the churches were even turned into butchers' shops.) ; in short, every outrage, both on decency and humanity, was committed, and a scene was exhibited too black for any pen to paint. How shocking is war when it is thus prosecuted ! If it be a necessary evil. Jet it at least be deplored as a dreadful alternative ; let it he waged with some sense of honour, and some principle of feeling ; and let not the character of man be degraded by a barbarous delight in crimes which should be estranged from his heart. Shortly after our arrival, a Greek accosted us, and politely offered his services, which we readily accepted. He has since constantly attended us, and, being of a loquacious disposition, he soon acquainted us with every anecdote and occurrence of his life. During the war he had deserted his country, and fought, with various success, under the Russian banners. He took great delight in boasting of his achievements ; in shewing the scars which he had received ; and enumerating the perils from which he had escaped. Often have I wondered, that his offended countrymen, who sometimes listened to his recital, did not rise against him, and put a period to his insolence and his baseness, by planting their daggers in his heart. The exasperation would almost have excused the mode of revenge, and it could hardly have been considered as a dishonourable offering at the altar of injured and insulted patriotism. Though in a manner an uninterested auditor, I felt a kind of horrour kindle within me, whenever he expatialied on this hateful theme. He completely exhausted my patience, and irritated my feelings ; for I cannot help detesting the wretch, who rejoices in the misfortunes of his native land, and is designedly instrumental in accelerating its ruin. It is the most execrable and unnatural of all crimes, and betrays such a total depravity of heart, such an entire dereliction of honour, generosity, and sentiment, that no punishment which this world can inflict can be commensurate to the iniquity of such atrocious guilt. \n \n [Text continues description.

    "Description":"It was necessary to make so many preparations for our journey from Galatz, that we did not get away till late on the 5th. \n \n Our waggons formed a very respectable caravan. They were twelve in number, and were drawn by ninety horses.\n [Fn. Mr. Vanderschroef transported a considerable quantity of merchandize from Galatz to Buchorest, which was the reason of our having occasion for so many waggons and horses. ]\n We had twenty postillions to conduct them, and one of the prince of Moldavia's officers, who had been sent to us on application, attended us as far as Fokshan, where we arrived on the 7th in the evening. \n \n Notwithstanding we had with us such a numerous train of men and horses, our travelUng expences through this countrywere very trifling. Between Smyrna and Constantinople, on the contrary, we found every thing excessively dear, which, however, may be easily accounted for, from the number of European travellers who frequent that road, and who have introduced many of those charges to which they have been accustomed in their own countries. \n \n This route was considerably out of our way; but Vanderschroef, whose hopes were always preposterous, had imagined that the prince would defray his expences, and, on that account, had insisted on this irrational plan. He found, however, when an explanation took place, that he had been mistaken in his calculation, and I was not displeased, when I heard of his disappointment. It was a just punishment for his obstinacy and credulity, which were a continual source of vexation, inconvenience, and delay, to the whole party. \n \n The road, leading from Galatz to Fokshan, is tolerably good; but the villages we passed through were miserable in the extreme, and had all suffered, more or less, from the inhumanity of the Russian troops. The inhabitants were wretchedly clothed, and the only provisions, with which they could supply us, were bad bread and a few eggs : even these, we could not procure in abundance. We found the climate cold and inconstant, the weather generally changing two or three times a day, and the face of the country, in most parts, resembles that of Bulgaria, being very naked and level, and consisting chiefly of pasture land.",

A rivulet, which runs nearly through its centre, forms the boundary of these two provinces, whose princes regard each other with mutual jealousy, and exact the most rigid observation of their respective prerogatives. As an instance of the foolish extent to which this point of privilege is carried : If a man, in one district, commit any crime whatever, and, by passing the rivulet, can effect his escape into the other, before the magistrates can secure him, his person is inviolable. This, it must be owned, is a most unwarrantable and impolitic custom, the more especially as the two provinces, though not under the same government, appertain to the same empire. Even if they were not united by any such close connexion, the observance of a practice so immoral in its tendency, and so mischievous in its consequence, would be still liable to much reprobation. It might, in some measure, be extenuated; but it could not be justified : for no country should hold out an encouragement to vice, by affording it protection ; but, on the contrary, should exert its utmost power and influence in bringing to justice that offender, who has violated his duty as a citizen, and grievously transgressed those fundamental laws of society which it is evidently the interest of every community vigilantly and strictly to maintain. \n \n Fokshan is also an interesting spot, on account of a dreadful battle which was fought under its walls in the month of August 1789, between the Russians and Germans on one side, and the Turks on the other. The Turkish army, which was in considerable force, had been sent by the grand vizir Hassan, under the command of the pacha Mehmct, in the view of surprising, and cutting off, the Imperialists, who were encamped in the neighbourhood of this town : but the sudden arrival of Suwarrow, not only prevented the realization of his hopes, but terminated in the total defeat of the OttomanS.\n \n [Description of Rassovat.]\n \n Fokshan, for Turkey, is a neat town, and the country, which surrounds it, is diversified and fertile. On the Walachian side, which is in a high state of cultivation, there is a mountain, at the distance of about four leagues, on which such a prodigious quantity of wine is grown, that although it is sold at the low rate of two paras (A para is a little more than a halfpenny, twenty of them making a shilling) the oke (An oke is 2lb. Both wine and oil pay duty by the weight), and the prince claims but ten per cent, on the gross amount, it yields him an annual income of one hundred thousand piastres. This luxuriant spot also furnishes an abundance of excellent timber, which is an article of extensive traffic, being carried in boats to Galatz, and thence in larger vessels to Constantinople, where it is bought up for the purpose of making masts. The Russians are the principal purchasers and consumers of the wine.",

Nel resto del tempo si pascono di legumi, et poi di herbe, et perche ancora queste mancano in qualche luoco mangiano frutti di Ginebri, et ne i luochi vicino al mare si pascono di ostrache de’ quali hanno in abondanza di tre sorti, certe gramdissime, cioè fino a tre palmi chiamate pinne. Altre si generano dentro i sassi nel fondo di quei canali del mare, che entrano fra i monti, quali con Martelli grandi di ferro rompono, et chiamano dattili della loro figura, ma assai maggiori. Altri si generano si generano nelle frasche, o vero legni buttando loro nel mare una quantità di fascine l’una legata all’altra, che da un solo palo dependono, nel quale fanno un segno acciò si conosca il padrone, et legarlo al lito del mare, et questa è la vigna et campo loro, quando vogliono mangiare ciascuno va alla sua infrascata, et tirata la corda piglia qualche ramo pieno di ostrache, levandone il suo bisogno. In una valle Nostro Signore ha provisto alla povertà di quel populo in questo modo, che serrata la valle dalla parte che sbocca al mare con un gran bastione si empie dell’acqua, che cade da i Monti, et fa un laco, che produce pesci si grossi che si cuocono senza oglio, poi là verso il mese di marzo lo sturano, et andata l’acqua al mare sopra a quella Argilla grassa seminano il grano marzolino, et lo mietono ne medesimo anno. Ma nel mese di maggio cominciano ad havere la carne di Capretti, et di Castratti, et simili animali dalle montagne di Morlachia, Servia, et Bosna et d’altri luochi superiori per vile prezzo et cosi del cacio et del latte, col quale notriscono i loro figli piccoli, che dei cibi grossi, che essi mangiano, non sono capaci. Della poverta delle case cosa estrema, le fanno delle scaglie di sassi de monti, dove habitano componendole insieme senza calce et senza luto [fango] di modo che q[ues]to P[adre] stando in letto la notte vedeva lampeggiare il cielo come fosse stato allo scop[er]to et dormono per lo piu sulla paglia ma quei dell’isole et luochi vicino al mare perche m[olt]i di loro sono marinari dalli altri paesi di proveggono di ogni cosa et stanno bene accom[m]odati: in andare a questi popoli pati m[ol]ti disaggi et pericoli per terra et per mare questo sia detto della miss[io]ne di Raugia dove si tratten[n]e intorno a due an[n]i facendo ancora nella Citta i n[ost]ri soliti essercitij et massime aiuto m[ol]ti giovani nobili della Citta con fare di loro una congregatione trattando quasi ogni giorno di cose spir[itua]li et co[mmun]icandoli ogni otto giorni elegendo piu tosto di stare nello spedale in una puzza orrenda che nelle cam[m]ere accortinate del Arc[ivescov]o dove gli pareva stando di lussuriare vi si trattenne quasi due an[n]i finche fu richiamato a Roma.",

    "Description":"A brief Geographical Account of Scotland. \n     Scotland is bounded on the North by the Irish Sea and England, from which it is divided by Solway Firth, and the Rivers Esk and Kexsop; on the West Border, by the Cheviot Hills in the Middle Marches; and by the lower Parts of the Tweed, on the East Border.  On the East it is bounded by the German Sea; on the North by the Deucaledonian Sea; and on the West, by the great Western Ocean.\n     Its greatest Length from Dungsby-head or John of Grot's-house in Caithness, to the Mull of Galoway towards Ireland, is no more than about 215 Scots Miles; but if we reckon directly North from Dumfries, or the said Mull of Galloway, to the utmost Parts of Caithness, or Strathnavern, the Length will not be so much; and less still, if we reckon brom Berwick to either of these Places. \n     Its Breadth, from the Point of Ard-na-murchan near the Isle of Mull, about the middle Part of Scotland in the West, to Buchan-ness in the East Parts, towards the North, is about 140 Scots Miles; but the Sea running up into the Land, or the Land thrusting out into the Sea in many Places, makes the Breadth of it every-where else very various and disproportionable; for in the South Parts it is seldom 100 Miles over, and in the North Parts, beyond Inverness, not so many; so that there is no House above 40 or 45 Miles from salt Water.\n     Besides the main Land, there are about 300 Islands, some of them very considerable, which may be distinguished into several Classes: The Western Islands called Hebrides, or Æbudæ, by Latin Authors; the Orcades, or Orkney Islands: the Islands of Shetland, or Zetland, and some few in the Firth of Forth.\nThe whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers, many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea, (which in several Places are very wide and deep) afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fishing and Shipping: But 'tis much to be regretted, that the Land is neither cultivated, nor the Fishing and Shipping carried on and improved, to so much Advantage as might be expected. \n     Tho' the Soil is not generally so level and fruitful as that of England, yet the South Parts of Scotland are far more pleasant than, and preferable to, the North Parts of England; and there are every-where all Things necessary for human Life: And not only sufficient for the Inhabitants, but also to export and exchange for such foreign Commodities as the People want, and to return considerable Sums. (vol. IV, pp. 1-2)\n\n\nThe Salmon-fishery is particularly the Boast and Delight of the Scots; insomuch that for it they too much neglect all the rest.\nTheir SALMON are accounted the best in Europe, and tho' their Barrels be a Third less than that of Berwick, yet they have yielded 10 Livres more per Barrel, in France; partly because of the Goodness, and partly because better cured, wherein the Magistrates and Town-council of Aberdeen take a very particular Care. Salmon abount not only in the navigable Rivers of Scotland, but in those which are less, in most Parts of the Kingdom; and they valued them so much formerly, that in several of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad selling them to England, except for Gold. Clyde abounds with Salmon, for which the Town of Renfrew has been famous and Bishop Lesley, in his Description of Scotland, says, They used, in his Time, to employ sixty Vessels in Fishing most of Spring and Summer; but 'tis much short of Aberdeen, where the same Author says, the Rivers Dee and Don exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon : For which he assigns this Reason, That they delight in clear Streams, which occasions our Rivers in Scotland to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy. The other Places, most remarkable for Salmon-fishing in Scotland, and in the Dovern at Bamf, the Rivers Nesse, Nairn, Findorn, Lossey and Spey in Murray; the latter abounds with Salmon for 60 Miles together. Lochlomond in Lenox is remarkable for Salmon of excellent Taste, Loch-ou in Argyll, the like: And there is good Salmon-fishing in the Rivers Lough and Speynie in Lochaber, in the Bay of Cromarty, near Dingwal Castle, and in the Rivers Tay and Tween, and other smaller Rivers in the bordering Counties. They have marl'd or speckled Salmon in Harries, North-uist and Benbecula. And in the Isle of Sky, there are no less than 30 Rivers all abounding with Salmon. (vol. IV pp. 6-7)\n\nAs to their COD-fishing, Mr. Spruel (an eminent Scots Merchant, who laid an Account of the Product of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parliament, some Years ago) says, he was inform'd by a Yarmouth Man, who use to buy those Fish and Salt on the Scots Coast, that he has sometimes got four thousand cur'd Fish in a Voyage, at 1d. or 2d. apiece, and retail'd them again from 18d. to 2s. 6d. apiece; which shews what vast Advantage might be made of the Trade, since the Scots Cod are reckon'd as good or better than those of Newfoundland. And what cont[r]ibutes much to the Cheapness of this and the Herring-fishery in Scotland, is that they are caught with fewer Hands, and Vessels of far less Expence, than Doggers, which must be well mann'd and strong, because oblig'd to lie at Sea; whereas the Scots catch those Fish in their own Creeks, Bays, and Harbours, wwhere few Hands and open Vessels are for the most part sufficient, because they are seldom exposed to any Danger by Storms, being always near the Shore, and laid up at Night. (vol. IV, p. 7)\n\nHERRINGS abound on all the Coasts of the Kingdom, but especially on the Western Isles, which are reckon'd the best and fattest, tho' not so large as those taken on the Eastern and Northern Coasts. The Scots Herring-fishing is accounted the best in the World, and the Dutch have got a great Part of their Wealth by it. (vol. IV, p. 7)\n\n\nHaddocks, Sturgeon, Turbut, Trouts, Perch, Pike, Scate, Greyberd, Maycril, Keeling, Whiting, Sea-urchin, Cat-fish, Cockpadle, Lyths, Spirlings, Soles, Flukes, Garvie, Eels, are also caught on the Scotish Coasts in great Plenty, for Home-consumption.\nOtters, whose Skins are useful for Muffs, &c. are very numerous in the Isles.\nShell-fish of all sorts, as Lobsters, Crabs, Oysters, are also found in vast Quantities in the Western Islands ; the latter so large, that they must be cut in three or four Pieces, to be eaten.\nCockles, Muscles, Limpets, Wilks, Scallops, and Spouts, are cast up by the Tide in such Numbers on the Isles, that the People cannot consume them. (vol. IV, p. 9)\n\n\nPEARL being the Product of Fish, it is proper to discourse of the Scots Pearl here. Mr. Spruel, the Merchant above-mentioned, who understood the Pearl-trade best of any Man in the Kingdom, having dealt in it above forty Years, says, He has sometimes given a hundred Rixdollars, which is near 25 l. for one Scots Pearl ; and that he had Scots Pearl as fine, clear, and more transparent, than any Oriental Pearl. Tho' the latter be more easily match'd because they are all of a yellow Water, yet Foreigners covet Scots Pearl. The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearl-shell, the more Sign it is of the Age and Goodness of a Pearl; for the smooth Shells are young and barren: Therefore he proposed, that a Law should be made to forbid the Fishing of young Pearl ; for the longer they stay in the Water, the more valuable they are : So that he would have no Shells taken up less than four Inches in Length, or two or three in Breadth ; and that none should be allowed to offery any Pearl to be sold, that weighs less than five Grains; which is as reasonable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon, since Pearl are of much more Value; whereas, had they lain in the Waters their due Time, they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece. \nPearl is found in most Place of the Nation where Salmon are taken ; and once in twenty Years, he says, there is a great Pearl-fishing in Scotland. This does not hinder, but that Pearl-shells of the Size he proposes, or larger, may be taken up at any time when found ; and these are probably to be had among the unfrequented Isles....\nTho' the small Pearl be not so useful for Ornament, yet they may be of very good Use in Physick, and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills, being reputed the chief of all Cordials, and very good against the Plague, violent and pestilential Fevers, Fluxes, Heart-burning, Giddiness of the Head, Trembling of the Heart, &c. which is sufficient to shew, that the Pearl-fishery well deserves Encouragement, since we may be supply'd with it much cheaper at Home, than from the Indies. (vol. IV, pp. 9-11)\n\n\nTHE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; which are generally black, except in Corn-soils, where they seldom breed or keep any more than are necessary for the Plough or the Pail. But 'tis observable, that such as are bred in other Parts, and equal in Size to those bred in some Parts of England, even where the Land seems to be better.\nIn general, their Sheep and Cattle are much smaller than those of England, especially in Pasture-lands ; yet are they of a far sweeter and more delicious Taste.   The Highlanders bring great Numbers of them yearly into the Lowlands, where some are fatted ; but the Bulk of them, and also many of those bred in the Lowlands, are sent into divers Parts of England, especially to St. Faith's near Norwich, where they turn out to good Account; as I have observed in its Place.\nThey have also very many Hogs, and an incredible Number of Goats, particularly in the North and Highlands ; the latter they eat themselves, but the former they pickle and export, as they likewise do vast Quantities of Salt Beef.\nIn the Southern Counties there are no Deer, except in Gentlemens Parks ; but every-where else, they are in great Plenty.\nThey breed great Numbers of Horses, especially in Galloway and the Highland ; small indeed, but capable of great Fatigue, especially if we consider, that they are not only more proper for the Saddle, and other Uses in the Country, which being hilly, will not admit, in many Place, of Teams and Carriages ; but are more hardy than Horses of a larger Size, and will thrive upon what would starve great Horses. Nevertheless, in many Places of the Lowlands they can breed Horses fit for War, Coach, or Carriage.\nScotland has not only Plenty of domestick Fowl, such as are common to other Countries ; but many that are peculiar to themselves, especially in the Islands, where they are in such Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither consume nore vend half of them ; but their Trade for them will still increase, as it has done since the Union.\nTheir Fowl and Eggs afford a large Fund of Trade for Food, and their Feathers for Bedding and other Uses : Their Fat is made use of by the Inhabitants not only in many Cases where Oil is necessary, but likewise for Physick. (vol. IV, pp. 11-12)\n\n\nFLAX abounds in Scotland, so that besides what they consume themselves, they export great Quantities of Linen, brown and whitened ; which is one of the greatest Manufactures of the Kingdom, and, if duly regulated and encourage, as it is more and more since the Union, might save a great deal of Money in the Island, besides what it may bring in to it ; for the Scots have improved their Linen Manufacture much of late ; and beside fine Linen, make very good Holland, Cambrick, Muslins, plain and striped, Calicoes, Damask, Ticken for Beds, &c. which and dyed Threads, Laces, Tape, &c. \nMr. Spruel (in his Account current betwixt Scotland and England) says, He has known, out of a Pound of Flax of Scots Growth, which cost but 12 d. six Spangles of fine Yarn spun, which was sold at Glasgow at about 4 s. 8 d. per Spangle ; which made the Product of that 12 d. to the Spinners 28 s. and, made into fine Muslin, that same Pound of Flax amounted to 10 or 12 Dollars, which is 2 l. 16 s. 8 d. or 2 l. 16 s. the Charges of Weaving and Whitening deducted. He adds, that from one Pound of Scots Flax, Lace-makers have made Lace to the Value of 8 l. Sterling ; which is sufficient to shew how much the Linen Manufacture may be improv'd there, and how many poor Women, who are not capable of employing themselves otherwise, may get a Livelihood by it, and what Money it may bring into the Nation.\nTheir HEMP is also capable of being improved, not only to save Money in the Island, which is exported for Canvas, Sailcloth, &c. but also to export, and to make Nets for their Fishers, and other Uses. \nThe numerous and large Flocks of Sheep they have in Scotland produce abundance of WOOL, from whence come Manufactures of several Sorts ; as Broad-cloth, Coarse or Housewife's-cloth, Fingrims, Serges, Bays, Crapes, Temmin, Glasgow Plaids, Worsted Camblets, and other Stuffs and Stockens for Home-consumption and Export ; besides their Tallow and Skins. Their Wool in general is not so good as that of England ; yet they have brought their Broad-cloth lately to a great Perfection, but can never equal England in that Part of Woolen Manufacture : Nevertheless it is very proper for Serges, Bays, Camblets, Shaloons, and other Stuffs ; and by due Regulation is capable of great Improvement for a foreign Trade. They are come to a great Perfection in making Stuffs ; and for Plaids, I shall observe by-and-by, they exceed all the World. ...\n\nThe Scots Plaids are a Manufacture in which they exceed all Nations, as I have said, both as to Colour and Fineness. They have of late been pretty much fansied in England, for Beds, Hangings, Window-curtains, and Night-gowns, for both Sexes ; so that Attempts have been made at Norwich to imitate them ; but they fall much short of the Scots in Colour, Fineness, and Workmanship, as is evident at first Sight. (vol. IV, pp. 12-14)\n\nThe Wheat of Scotland is so excellent, that Joseph Scaliger, who had been in the Country, says, No Bread in Europe is comparable to what is made of it, for Whiteness, Lightness, and easy Digestion.  It abounds in the Mers, Lothian, Gavrie, &c. so that they have not only enough for their own consumption, but for Exportation. \nOATS are the most universal Grain of the Kingdom, and exceed those in England, for all Uses.  They grow very well every-where, and in such Quantitites as afford a considerable Fund for Export, both in Grain and Meal, and make very good Break and Drink.\nPEASE they have in great Plenty, both for their own Consumption, and for Exportation ; and they are so good of the Kind, that in some Parts of the Country the labouring Husbandmen make good nourishing Bread of them. \nBEANS they have also in great plenty for their own Use, and for Export.\nBARLEY grows likewise very well in Scotland ; but they sow more of that Sort they call Beer, which has four Rows of Grain upon an Ear ; whereas Barley has but two : Of this they make good Break, Broth, Ale, and Beer, and export great Quantities. \nRYE grows also very well in Scotland, and makes good Bread ; but this they don't cultivate so much as they do the Grains above-mentioned. (vol. IV, p.15) \n\nThere are many large Woods of OAK in Scotland, which afford Materials for Building and Shipping, and for the Husbandman's Use ; and the Country is very improveable this way, if Planting were more encouraged ; however, they have at present not only such as are fit for the Uses above-mentioned, but also for Pipe-staves and Barrels ; and their Bark is of Use to the Tanners, great Quantities of which are annually exported to Ireland, and elsewhere.  They have likewise ASH TREES, ELMS, and others, fit for Building, and other deomestick Uses ; and great Forests of FIR, which afford Materials for Building and Shipping ; and might, with due Care, afford Pitch and Taw, without being obliged to bring such large Quantities from the Northern Coutnries, as is usually done by the Inhabitants of Great Britain.\n     There were formerly many great Woods in Scotland, among which the Forest of Caledonia was famous ; but there are now scarce any Remains of it. \n     The Woods are more rare than formerly in the Southern Parts of the Kingdom ; of which the most remarkable now left are those of Hamilton, Calendar, and Torwood : But in the North, especially in Perthshire, Lochaber, Badenoch, and Mar, there are many Forests, some of them 20, and some 30 Miles in Length. \n     They have abundance of Fruit-trees of all Sorts, in their Gardens and Orchards, and might, by Improvement, not only have sufficient to afford them Fruit for Home-consumption, but also Cyder for their own Drinking and Export.(vol. IV, pp. 16-17)\n\nTHE following valuable Commodities, and Precious Stones, are found in different Parts of Scotland.\n     Coral and Coraline, in the Isles of Lewes, Sky, and Jura. \n     Ambergris, on the Coasts of the Islands Bernera, South-uist, Bintire, and Orkney.\n     Marcasites, Lapis Ceranius, Lapis Hecticus, Agat of different Sizes and Colours ; all in the Isle of Sky.\n     Cyrstal, in the Isles of Sky, Arran, and St. Kilda. \n     Fullers Earth, in the Isle of Sky. \n     Fine Shells, which pass in Africa for Money, in the Isles. \n     Leadstone, in the Isle of Cannay. \n     Sperma Ceti, on the Coasts of Orkney, and other Isles. \n     Mines of Gold, in Crawford Moor.  Also Azure, in the Reigb of James IV. \n     Silver Mines, three Miles South of Linlithgow, in the Reign of James VI. \n     Copper, in Airthey, near Stirling. \n     Lead, in Clydsdale, of which the Earl of Hopton makes good Account. \n     Lead and Tin in Orkney. \n     Iron, at Dumfernling in Fife. \n     Coal in Lothian, Fife, &c. \n     Free-stone, Slate, Lime-stone, Marble, in great Plenty all over the Country. \n     And Sir Robert Sibbalds asserts, that they have also Diamonds, Rubies, Carbuncles, Hyacinths, Jaspers, Cornelians, Amthysts, &c. to whom I refer you for farter Satisfaction on the Head.

[Bishop Lesley] says, the Rivers Dee and Don exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon: For which he assigns this Reason, That they delight in clear Streams, which occasions our Rivers in Scotland to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy.  (vol. IV, p. 6)\n\nAn Instance of what great Improvement may be made of their Wool, we have from Mr. Spruel (in his Account current); viz. That they make such fine Worsted Stockens at Aberdeen, that they yield 10, 15, 20, and 30 s. a Pair for Womens Stockens; which is sufficient to shew, that they are capable of making Stockens at lower Rates, especially considering that they have store of very good Wool brought thither from the Highland and Isles; which because sold at the Cross of Aberdeen, is commonly called Cross-Wool. (vol. IV, p. 14)\n\nTHE most remarkable Mountains of Scotland are the Grampian Mountains, which run from East to West, from near Aberdeen to Cowal in Argyllshire, almost the whole Breadth of the Kingdom, famous for the Battle fought on them betwixt the Romans and \nthe ancient Scots and Caledonians, under the Conduct of Galgacus, as we find in Tacitus.

The Wells are two in Number, near one another ; the higher Well runs through whitish and crystalline Stones, and the lower through black ones, resembling Marcasites of Antimony:  The Smell of the Water is like that of Gunpowder, and it dyes Silver of a black Colour.  To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter resembling stinking Sulphur of Antimony, of a yelloish red Colour; the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of antimony, and some of them contain a metallick Matter, that sparkles like Antimony.  Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook, there sticks to the Rock a whitish Salt, and perhaps a nitrous Matter, which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water.  Those Waters also purge by Stool and Vomit, and are very good against Colick \nand Nephritick Pains, because they powerfully remove the Obstructions of the Bowels.  They are outwardly applied  to Ulcers, and against Pains in the Joints ; they are strongest in their Operation in the driest Season of the Summer and Autumn, but are not so good in a rainy, or in the Winter-season.

In these Uciques much amber is found of good quality, which the Moors collect and sell in other places, and likewise many pearls and small seed pearls are found in the sea in beds (crusts), which they cannot gather or fish up, and whenever they do get them out they boil them, and extract the said pearls and seed pearls dingy and burnt, and there is no doubt that there are many and good ones, if they knew how to extract them, as is done in Sael, Cochoromandel, and in Barahe, which will be mentioned hereafter.",

    "Description":"Having passed the Little Vciques, for the Indies, at xviii leagues from them there is a river which is not very large, whereon is a town of the Moors called Sofala, close to which town the King of Portugal has a fort. These Moors established themselves there a long time ago on account of the great trade in gold which they carry on with the Gentiles of the mainland: these speak somewhat of bad Arabic (garabia), and have got a king over them, who is at present subject to the King of Portugal. And the mode of their trade is that they come by sea in small barks which they call zanbucs (sambuk), from the kingdoms of Quiloa, and Mombaza, and Melindi; and they bring much cotton cloth of many colours, and white and blue, and some of silk; and grey, and red, and yellow beads, which come to the said kingdoms in other larger ships from the great kingdom of Cambay, which merchandise these Moors buy and collect from other Moors who bring them there, and they pay for them in gold by weight, and for a price which satisfies them; and the said Moors keep them and sell these cloths to the Gentiles of the kingdom of Benamatapa who come there laden with gold, which gold they give in exchange for the before mentioned cloths without weighing, and so much in quantity that these Moors usually gain one hundred for one. They also collect a large quantity of ivory, which is found all round Sofala, which they likewise sell in the great kingdom of Cambay at five or six ducats the hundred weight, and so also some amber, which these Moors of Sofala bring them from the Vciques. They are black men, and men of colour--some speak Arabic, and the rest make use of the language of the Gentiles of the country. They wrap themselves from the waist downwards with cloths of cotton and silk, and they wear other silk cloths above named, such as cloaks and wraps for the head, and some of them wear hoods of scarlet, and of other coloured woollen stuffs and camelets, and of other silks. And their victuals are millet, and rice, and meat, and fish. In this river near to the sea there are many sea horses, which go in the sea, and come out on land at times to feed. These have teeth like small elephants, and it is better ivory than that of the elephant, and whiter and harder, and of greater durability of colour. In the country all round Sofala there are many elephants, which are very large and wild, and the people of the country do not know how to tame them: there are also many lions, ounces, mountain panthers, wild asses, and many other animals. It is a country of plains and mountains, and well watered. The Moors have now recently begun to produce much fine cotton in this country, and they weave it into white stuff because they do not know how to dye it, or because they have not got any colours; and they take the blue or coloured stuffs of Cambay and unravel them, and again weave the threads with their white thread, and in this manner they make coloured stuffs, by means of which they get much gold.",

These are brown men, who go bare, but covered from the waist downwards with coloured stuffs, or skins of wild animals; and the persons most in honour among them wear some of the tails of the skin behind them, which go trailing on the ground for state and show, and they make bounds and movements of their bodies, by which they make these tails wag on either side of them. They carry swords in scabbards of wood bound with gold or other metals, and they wear them on the left hand side as we do, in sashes of coloured stuffs, which they make for this purpose with four or five knots, and their tassels hanging down, like gentlemen; and in their hands azagayes, and others carry bows and arrows: it must be mentioned that the bows are of middle size, and the iron points of the arrows are very large and well wrought. They are men of war, and some of them are merchants: their women go naked as long as they are girls, only covering their middles with cotton cloths, and when they are married and have children, they wear other cloths over their breasts.",

And from this island likewise the Portuguese fort in Sofala draws its supplies, both of Portuguese goods and of the produce of India, on account of the road being longer by the mainland.\n \n Opposite this island there are many very large elephants and wild animals. The country is inhabited by Gentiles, brutish people who go naked and smeared all over with coloured clay, and their natural parts wrapped in a strip of blue cotton stuff, without any other covering; and they have their lips pierced with three holes in each lip, and in these holes they wear bones stuck in, and claws, and small stones, and other little things dangling from them.",

This island has got a king over it, and from hence there is trade with Sofala with ships, which carry much gold, which is dispersed thence through all Arabia Felix, for henceforward all this country is thus named on account of the shore of the sea being peopled with many towns and cities of the Moors; and when the King of Portugal discovered this land, the Moors of Sofala, and Zuama, and Anguox, and Mozambique, were all under obedience to the King of Quiloa, who was a great king amongst them. And there is much gold in this town, because all the ships which go to Sofala touch at this island, both in going and coming back. These people are Moors, of a dusky colour, and some of them are black and some white; they are very well dressed with rich cloths of gold, and silk, and cotton, and the women also go very well dressed out with much gold and silver in chains and bracelets on their arms, and legs, and ears. The speech of these people is Arabic, and they have got books of the Alcoran, and honour greatly their prophet Muhamad. This King, for his great pride, and for not being willing to obey the King of Portugal, had this town taken from him by force, and in it they killed and captured many people, and the King fled from the island, in which the King of Portugal ordered a fortress to be built, and thus he holds under his command and government those who continued to dwell there.",

All these places on this coast trade with the country with their cloths and other merchandise, and they bring from it gold, ivory, honey, wax and slaves; and sometimes they are at war with them, for they are Christians, and they capture many of them; and such captives are much valued by the Moors, and amongst them are worth much more money than other slaves because they find them sharp and faithful, and well-built men in body, and when they turn Moors, they become greater emperors than the original Moors. These Moors of Arabia Felix are all black and good fighting men; they go bare from the waist upwards, and from thence downwards they cover themselves with cloths of cotton; and the more honourable men amongst them wear their cloths over them like Almalafas, and the women are covered in the same way:...",

And in their country there are many who live in the fields and mountains, like Beduins: they are black men, very well made: they have many horses, and make use of them, and are good riders, and there are great sportsmen and hunters amongst them. Their provisions are flesh of all kinds, milk, butter, and wheaten bread, and of these things there is a great abundance. Their clothes are of hides because the country is wanting in cloths; and there is a law amongst them by which certain families and ranks of persons may wear cloths, and the rest of the people may wear only hides well dressed and tanned. Amongst them there are men and women who have never drunk water, but only milk, which greatly supports them, and quenches the thirst, on account of its being more healthy and substantial, and there is great abundance of it in the country. These people are Christians of the doctrine of the blessed Saint Bartholomew, as they say; and their baptism is in three kinds, of blood, fire, and water: that is to say, that they circumcise themselves, and mark themselves on the temples and forehead with fire, and also in water, like the Catholic Christians. Many of them are deficient in our true faith, because the country is very large, and whilst in the principal city of Babel Malech, where Prester John resides, they may be Christians, in many other distant parts they live in error and without being taught; so that they are only Christians in name.",

And this trade now, in a great measure, ceases on account of the Portuguese, whose fleets prohibit the navigation of the Moors from India to the Red Sea. And the Great Sultan, lord of Cairo, who loses most by this, ordered a fleet to be built in the port of Suez, for which he had the wood and artillery, and other equipments transported by land, in which much money was expended; and this fleet was of ships and galleys, in order to pass with it to India and there forbid the Portuguese from cruising. And when this fleet was built many people of different nations went with it to the first India, which is the Kingdom of Cambay; and the Captain of it was Amir Uçen, and with this fleet they met that of Portugal in front of a city named Dyu, and there they fought vigorously, and many people were killed, and at last the Moors, Turks, and Mamelukes were conquered and all their fleet was taken and part of it burned, and on this account and several other victories which the Portuguese gained over the before-mentioned Moors, they lost their navigation in the Red Sea, and the said port of Suez remains without the trade in spices.",

In the aforesaid Guida port of Mecca a fortress has been lately built by Emir Hussein, the Moorish captain of the ships of the Sultan, which the Portuguese destroyed in India: this captain when he saw himself defeated, did not dare return to his country without performing some service to his king, and he decided on begging of the King of Cambay (who is called Sultan Mahamud) assistance in money, and so also from the nobles and merchants of his kingdom and from other Moorish kings, in order to construct this fortress, saying: that since the Portuguese, (whom they call Franks) were so powerful, it would not be wonderful if they were to come into this port and were to go and destroy the house of Mahomet. And these Moorish kings and people hearing his petition, and seeing the power of the King of Portugal, it seemed to them that this might come to pass, and thus all gave him great gifts, by means of which he loaded three ships with spices and other merchandise, and went with them to the Red Sea, and arrived at Guida, where he sold them, and with the money he made the said fortress, and during the time that he was building it, the Portuguese were making another inside the town of Calicut, and the King of Calicut begged the Captain Major of the King of Portugal to give him permission to send then a ship laden with spices to Mecca. And this permission was given him, and the ship was sent. And there went in it as captain an honourable person of the Moors named Califa, and he arrived at Guida the port of Mecca, where he came on shore very well dressed out, along with his people, and he found Emir Hussein building his fortress, and was asked by him news of the Portuguese. And this Califa answered him, telling him how they were in great peace at Calicut, and making a handsome fortress. And Emir Hussein asked him, how dare you come to Mecca being a friend of the Portuguese? Califa answered him, I am a merchant and am unable to do anything, but you who are a captain of the great Sultan if you go to India to turn them out of it, how came you to leave them there, and to make a fortress here? At which Emir Hussein was much put out, and ordered Califa immediately, and well dressed as he was, to take stones and mortar, he and his people, and help to build the fortress: and he made him work for the space of an hour. And Califa related this in Calicut later when he returned there.",

It is a very handsome city, with very large and fine houses, and a place of much trade, with good streets, and surrounded with a strong wall in their fashion. This city is on a point between a mountain and the sea; and this mountain ridge on the side of the main land is a precipitous rock, in such manner that on that side it has no more than one entrance, and on the top of this ridge, where the town is, there are many small towers, which look very pretty from the sea. Inside the city there is no water at all, and outside of the gate towards the main land there is a building to which they make water come in pipes from another mountain at some little distance from there, and between one ridge and the other ridge there was a great plain. In this city there are great Moorish merchants, and many Jews. They are white men, a few of them black, they dress in cloth of cotton, silk, scarlet wool, and camelots. Their clothes are long robes, and they wear caps on their heads, and with low shoes on their feet. Their victuals are plenty of meat, wheaten bread, and rice which comes from India: there is plenty of fruit as in our parts, and there are in this place many horses and camels. The king is always in the interior of the country, and he maintains his governor in this city. Many ships, great and small, come there from many parts; that is to say, from Jiddah, whence they bring them much copper and quicksilver, and vermillion, coral, cloths of wool and silk. And they take from here in return spices, drugs, cotton cloths, and other things from Cambay, with provisions and other goods. Many ships also touch there from Zeyla and Berbera with provisions and other goods, and carry away from there stuffs from Cambay, alaquequas, and large and small beads perforated for stringing, with which they trade in Arabia Felix, and in the country of Prester John. Some ships from Ormuz likewise touch there to trade, and also from Cambay, whence they bring much cotton stuff, spices, drugs, jewels and pearls, alaquequas, spun cotton, and unspun; and they take from these madder, opium, raisins, copper, quicksilver, vermillion, rose-water which they make there, woollen and silk stuffs, coloured stuffs from Mecca, and gold in ingots or coined, and thread and camelots. And these ships of Cambay are so many and so large, and with so much merchandise, that it is a terrible thing to think of so great an expenditure of cotton stuffs as they bring. There come likewise to this port of Aden many ships from Chaul and Dabul, and from Bengal and the country of Calicut; they used to come there with the before-mentioned goods and with a large quantity of rice and sugar, and cocoa-nuts which grow on the palm trees, and which are like nuts in flavour, and with the kernels they make drinking cups. There also arrive there ships from Bengal, Samatra, and Malaca, which bring much spices and drugs, silks, benzoin, alacar, sandal-wood, aloes-wood, rhubarb, musk, and much cotton stuffs from Bengal and Mangala, so that it is a place of as much trade as there can be in the world, and of the richest merchandise. The fleet and armament of the King of Portugal came to this city, and took and burned in its harbour several ships laden with much merchandise, and several empty ships, and it made an assault to enter the town, and mounted the walls with scaling ladders, which broke with the weight of the many people on them; so that the Portuguese went out again, and abandoned the town: and at this entry the Moors defended themselves very vigorously, and many of them died, and some of the Christians.",

It was in former times a country of Christians, and the Christian doctrine was lost there on account of Christian navigation having ceased there; and the Moors say that this was an island of Amazons, who later in the course of time mixed with men, and something of this appears to be the case, since there the women administer property and manage it, without the husbands having a voice in the matter. These people have a language of their own; they go without clothes, and only cover their nakedness with cotton cloths and skins: they have many cows and sheep, and date palms. Their victuals are meat, milk, and dates. In this island there is much dragon's blood and aloes of Socotra. And the Moors of Fartach built in it a fortress, to subjugate them, and turn them Moors; and some of those that lived around the fortress were Moors, and served the Moors of the fort like their slaves, both in their persons and property. A fleet of the King of Portugal arrived at this island, and took this fortress by force of arms from the Moors of Fartach, fighting with them: and they defended themselves much more vigorously than any men of these parts; so that they never would give themselves up, and all died in the fight, for none of them escaped; so that they are very good and daring fighting men. The Captain of this fleet left troops and artillery in this fortress in order to keep it in the name of the King of Portugal. And quite near to this island of Sacotora there are two other islands inhabited by coloured people and blacks, like the people of the Canary Islands, without law or knowledge, and they have no dealings with any other people. In these two islands much amber and of good quality is found, and many shells of the valuable and precious kind in the mine, and much dragon's blood and aloes of Socotra; and there are large flocks of sheep and oxen.",

And the importers afterwards employ the money in horses for India: these are very large and very good, and each one of them in India is worth five or six hundred ducats. And they also take from there much wormwood, which grows in that country. And in the interior of the country all the people are Beduins: in this country there is much wheat and plenty of meat and dates, grapes, and all other fruits which are in our parts. And all the ships which sail from India for the Red Sea, and having been delayed cannot arrive in good time with their merchandise at the place of their destination, remain to sell them in this port of Xeher, and from there they go to India along the coast to Cambay. And so this port is large and of much trade at all times. This King of Fartach is, with the whole of his kingdom, in obedience to the King of Aden, because he holds a brother of his a prisoner. The wormwood which grows in this country of Xeher is carried from here to all the world, and the ships of this place load the said wormwood, which is there worth a hundred and fifty maravedis the hundred weight.",

These places belonging to this kingdom are the following. In the beginning of this kingdom on the coast outside of this sea of Persia, is:--\n \n [See places called out.]\n \n This king of Ormuz possesses, besides these places already mentioned, on the coast of Arabia, many other towns in the country of Persia, on the sea-coast, and in the midst of the Persian Sea many islands inhabited by Moors, in which he has many large towns, very rich and handsome, all of which are named separately further on, and afterwards the island and city of Ormuz and its customs are mentioned.\n \n [...]\n \n Further on is another place called Guan-meda, and from there further on there are also some other places belonging to the king of Ormuz, which are the following--Lefete, Quesebi, and from here further on the coast turns to the north-west by north as far as the mouth of the river Eufrates, and it begins here to be a wide estuary. Berohu, Caljar, Xuza, Mohimasim, Lima, Gorbaz, Alguefa, Carmon. Which lasts two hundred and forty leagues, and then Bazera, a castle of Sophi. At the entrance of the river Eufrates the land turns to the sea in a southerly direction eighty leagues, and then returns as much again to the north, and after that turns again to the south, when there begin these towns--Cohomo, Barque Guex, Ganguan, Basido, Goxtaque, Conch, Conga, Ebrahemi, and as far as this there are one hundred and sixty-five leagues, and after that Xenase, Menahao Xamile, Leytam, Bamtani, Doani, and from this point the coast trends to the east for a distance of thirty leagues as far as Lorom. Between these places there are many large towns with much trade, and very respectable inhabitants, and great merchants; and many castles, which the King of Ormuz maintains for the defence of his country, and they are all on the coast of the Persian Sea. They are places abundantly supplied with meat and wheaten bread, barley, vines, and all other things which are found in our parts, and many dates; and the inhabitants of these towns are white, and very polite people; they dress in long clothes of silk and cotton stuffs and camelots; and this is a very rich country.",

It is a very well situated town, which has very good streets and squares. Outside of this city, in the island itself, there is a small mountain, which is entirely of rock salt and sulphur; this salt is in great lumps, and very white and good: they call it Indian salt, because nature produces it there; and the ships which come there from all parts take this salt as ballast, because in all other parts it is worth much money.\n \n The inhabitants of this island and city are Persians and Arabs, and they speak Arabic and another language which they call Persian. They are very white, and good-looking people, of handsome bodies, both men and women; and there are amongst them black and coloured people also, who are from the country of Arabia. And the Persians, who are very white, are fat and luxurious people, who live very well. They are very voluptuous, and have musicians with various instruments. There are among them very rich merchants, and many ships, because they have a good port, and they trade in many kinds of goods, which are imported there from many parts, and exported thence to other parts of India. They bring there all sorts of spices, drugs, precious stones, and other goods, such as pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmeg, long pepper, aloes-wood, sandal-wood, brasil-wood, balsam, tamarinds, Indian saffron, beeswax, iron, sugar, rice, cocoa-nuts, rubies, sapphires, giagonzas, amethysts, topazes, chrysolites, hyacinths, porcelain, benzoin; and upon all these goods much money is made, and many stuffs from the kingdom of Cambay, Chaul, Dabul, and Bengala, which are called Sinabasos, Chautars, Mamonas, Dugasas, Soranatis, which are kinds of stuffs of cotton very much valued amongst them for caps and shirts, which are much made use of by the Arabs and Persians, and people of Cairo, Aden, and Alexandria. They also bring to this city of Ormuz, quicksilver, vermillion, rose-water, brocade and silk stuffs, scarlet woollens, coarse camelots, and silk. And from China and Catuy they bring to this city by land much fine silk in skeins, and very rare musk and rhubarb; and they bring from Babilonia very fine torquoises, and some emeralds, and very fine lapis lazuli from Acar. And from Baharem and Julfar they bring much seed pearl and large pearls, and many horses from Arabia and Persia, of which they carry away to India every year as many as five or six hundred, and at times a thousand; and the ships which export these horses load much salt, dates, and raisins, and sulphur, and of the other goods which the Indians are pleased with.\n \n These Moors of Ormuz are very well dressed, with very white, long, and fine cotton shirts, and their fine drawers of cotton, and above that, very rich silk clothes and camelots, scarlet cloth, and very rich gauzes, with which they wrap their waists, and they wear in their girdles daggers and knives, ornamented with gold and silver, and some heavy short swords, all adorned with gold and silver, according to the rank of the wearers: and large round shields, richly garnished with silk, and in their hands they carry Turkish bows, painted with gold and very pretty colours, and their cords are of silk. These bows are of stiff wood and of buffaloe's horn; they carry very far, and these people are very good archers; their arrows are slender and well worked. Others carry in their hands iron maces, well wrought and elegant; others again, battle-axes of various patterns and of very good temper, and inlaid or enamelled. They are very agreeable and polite people, and very civil in their mutual relations. Their food is of very good meats, very well cooked, wheaten bread, and very good rice, and many other dishes very well prepared, and many kinds of conserves, and preserved fruits, and others fresh: that is to say, apples, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, figs, almonds, melons, radishes, salads, and all the other things which there are in Spain; dates of many kinds, and other eatables and fruits not used in our parts. They drink wine of grapes in secret, because their law forbids it them; and the water which they drink is flavoured with pistachio nuts, and set to cool, for which purpose they employ and seek many methods for cooling and preserving it cool. And all the noblemen and honourable merchants always take, wherever they go, both in the streets and public places, and on the road, a page with a bottle of water, which is covered underneath with silver, or with a silver cup, as much for state and show as for use and comfort. All these people possess gardens and farms, to which they go to enjoy themselves for some months of the year.\n \n This city of Ormuz is, as has been said, very rich and well supplied with everything in the way of provisions, but everything is very dear, because it is brought by sea from the towns of Arabia and Persia, for in the island there is nothing that can be made use of except salt; neither have they water to drink, for they bring it each day in boats from the mainland or other neighbouring islands. But for all that, the squares are full of all sorts of things, and everything is sold by weight, and with great order and regulation. And they give a very proper punishment to whoever falsifies the weights or sells above the regulation price; and they also sell cooked and roasted meat by weight, and so with all other cooked victuals; and all these so well arranged and so clean that many people do not have cooking done in their houses, but eat in the squares.\n \n The king is always in this city of Ormuz, in which he has some beautiful palaces, and a fortress, where he has his residence, and where he keeps his treasury; and there he holds all his court, and out of it provides governors or judges for all his states and lordships. But it is his council that does everything; and he does not meddle with any affair, but only amuses himself, neither would it have been in his power to do otherwise; for if he wished to govern in person, and wished to be free and exempt like other kings, immediately they would put his eyes out, and would put him in a house with his wife, and maintain him there miserably; and they would raise up another son of his as king, or some one else more fitting for it, of his lineage, in order that his council may govern all his kingdoms and territories peacefully in his name. And with respect to all the other heirs of the kingdom, as they grow up and become persons able to command and govern, if it should appear to the council that they desire to meddle with the government, they take them and put their eyes out also, and put them also in a house; so that there are always ten or twelve of these blind men, and those who reign live with this fear before them. They give food there to them and to their wives and children. This king has many men-at-arms, and many gentlemen who guard and serve him, and they receive very good pay and rations, and are always at the court with their arms; and they send some to the frontiers on the mainland whenever they are required.\n \n They make gold and silver money in this city; the gold coins are called Sarafin, and are worth three hundred maravedis, and most of them are halves, which are worth a hundred and fifty, a round coin like ours, and with Moorish letters on both sides, and about the size of a fanon of Calicut, with Moorish letters, and it is worth fifty-five maravedis; they call these tanga, and they are of very fine silver, and of the standard of twelve dinars. There is a large quantity of this money, both gold and silver, and much of it goes out to India, where it has much currency.\n \n There came a Portuguese fleet to this kingdom of Ormuz, and its captain-major was Alfonso de Alborquerque, who attempted to come to an understanding with this kingdom of Ormuz, but the Moors would not agree, and on that account this captain began to make war upon the whole kingdom at all the seaports, and he did them much injury, and at last he came and touched at the port of Ormuz with his fleet, and there was a great battle there, with many and great ships full of many and smart well-armed men. And the said captain routed the fleet of the Moors, and killed many of them, and sunk many of their ships, and took and burned many which were moored in the harbour, drawn up by the wall of the city. And when the king and the governors of the country saw such great destruction of their people and ships, without being able to assist them, they offered peace to the before-mentioned captain, who accepted it under the condition that they should let him make a fortress at one extremity of the city; and they agreed, and this began to be done; and the work having commenced, the Moors repented again, and did not choose that more should be built; and then the Portuguese began again to make war upon them, and they did them so great damage, and slaughtered so many people, that they made them tributary to the King of Portugal to the amount of fifteen thousand serafins of gold each year.\n \n Some years from that time the king and governors of Ormuz sent an ambassador with offers of services and letters to the King of Portugal, and the before-named captain returned with his answer and a good fleet to the city of Ormuz, and there they received him very peacefully in this city, and at once gave him permission and a place in which to built the fortress, which on a former occasion the Portuguese had begun to build: and he ordered it to be built at once, very large and magnificent. At this time the king, who was a Moor, and very young, and in the power of the governors, and so ruined that he did not dare do anything of himself, found the means to inform the captain-major secretly of the little liberty he enjoyed, and that the governors kept him like a prisoner, and that they had forcibly taken the government which belongs to others who were accustomed to exercise it, and that it appeared that they were exchanging letters with Sheikh Ismail in order to give him the kingdom. The captain-major kept this very secret, and determined to have an interview with the king; and they agreed that this interview should be in some large houses near the sea. On the day on which the interview was to take place, the captain-major entered the houses with ten or fifteen captains, leaving his people well arranged, and all concerted as was most convenient. So the king and his principal governor came there with many people, and the king and the governor entered the houses with ten or twelve honourable Moors, and the door was well shut and guarded. Then the captain-major ordered them to kill the governor with their daggers in his presence and that of the king: and he said to the king, \"Have no fear, Sir, for I do this to make you absolute king.\" However those who were without heard the noise, and began to raise a disturbance, that it to say, the relations, servants, and friends of the said governor, who were many in number, and all came armed, so that it was necessary for the captain-major to take the king by the hand; they went up on to the roof, both of them armed, in order that the king might speak thence to the Moors, and might pacify them; so he spoke to them, but could do nothing with them. They, on the contrary, required that he should confide to them his brother and lord: and they went thence to establish themselves in the king's palace, saying they would make another king. The captain-major wished to lay hands upon them, and thus they remained a great part of the day, and the king sought how to turn them out, and the captain-major determined to kill them by force or to drive them out, as they did not choose to go out of the fortress. So when the Moors saw that the captain-major, with the king, was determined to attack them, they resolved to give the fortress to the king; and when they gave it up, the king commanded that they should be banished immediately, they and their families; and this was done, and they went to the mainland.\n \n The captain-major conducted the king from these houses to the palace in triumph and honourably, and with many people, both of ours and of his, and entrusted him to the other governor who was so before. He then committed to him his palaces and the city very freely, and told the governor to serve the king very honourably, and to leave him to govern his country at his pleasure, and only give him advice, as happens with other Moorish kings: and thus he put him at liberty. He then left in the fortress that was built a captain and many men of Portugal, and ships, in order to favour this king, who does nothing without the advice of the captain of the fort. And he is in submission to the King of Portugal, with all his kingdoms and territories.\n \n After the captain-major had put everything in quiet and order, and under his command, he then had banished by the public crier, and turned out of the island all the paiderastoi, with a warning that if they returned there again they would be burned, at which the king showed great satisfaction. He likewise ordered all the blind kings who were in the city to be taken, and there were thirteen or fourteen of them, and put in a large ship, and he sent them to India, and they were landed at Goa, where he gave orders for them to be maintained at the expense of his revenues, so that they might end their days there, and not cause any disturbance in the kingdom of Ormuz, and be in peace and quietness.",

    "YearOfTravel":1516,
    "Description":"Leaving the kingdom of Ulcinde, in the same direction, at a distance of fifty leagues, the traveller enters the first India, in the great kingdom of Guzarat, which kingdom had belonged to King Darius. And the Indians have long histories of him and of King Alexander. This kingdom has many cities and towns in the interior of the country, as well as ports along the sea; and very much shipping. It has many merchants and shipowners, both Moors and Gentiles.\n \n The king, and the men-at-arms, and nobles of the country were all Gentiles formerly, and now they are Moors, since the Moors conquered the country in war, and hold the Gentiles subject to them, and molest them and treat them ill. There are three qualities of these Gentiles, that is to say, some are called Razbutes, and they, in the time that their king was a Gentile, were knights, the defenders of the kingdom, and governors of the country; they used to carry on war, and even now there remain some towns of them in the mountains, which have never chosen to pay obedience to the Moors, but, on the contrary, make war upon them; and the King of Cambaya is not sufficiently powerful to destroy them or subject them. They are very good knights and great archers, and they have many other kinds of arms with which they defend themselves from the Moors, without owning any king or lord to govern them. The others are called Banians, and are merchants and traders. These live amongst the Moors, and trade with them in their goods. They are men who do not eat meat nor fish, nor anything that has life; neither do they kill anything, nor like to see it killed, because their idolatry forbids it them; and they observe this to such an extreme that it is something marvellous. For it often happens that the Moors bring them some worms or little birds alive, saying they intend to kill them in their presence; and they ransom them, and buy them to set them flying, and save their lives for more money than they are worth. And in the same way, if the governor of the country has got a man to be executed, these Banians unite together and buy him from the officers of justice, that he may not die; and frequently they sell him to them. And in the same manner the Moors who beg for alms, when they want alms from these people, take great stones and strike themselves with them on the shoulders and the breast, and on their stomachs, as if they were going to kill themselves with them, and they receive alms not to do it, and to go away in peace. And others bring knives and stab themselves in the arms and legs before them, in order to extract alms; and others come to their doors to decapitate rats and snakes and other reptiles, and they give them money not to do it, so that they are very ill-treated by the Moors. If these people meet with a band of ants in the road, they hasten out of the road, and go and look for a place to pass without treading upon them. They likewise sup in the daytime because they do not light candles at night, in order that the mosquitoes and other insects may not come and die in the flame; and if of necessity they must have a candle, they keep them in lanterns of paper, or of stuff dipped in gum, so that no living thing can get there to suffer. If these people have lice they do not kill them, and if they worry them very much, they send to fetch some men whom they have amongst them, also Gentiles, whom they esteem of holy lives, like hermits, and who live in much abstinence for the love of their idols, and these people pick out their insects, and all those that they extract they put in their own heads, and they nourish them on themselves and on their flesh for the service of their idols. And so this law of not killing anything is held in great observance. On the other hand, they are great usurers and falsifiers of weights and measures, and merchandise, and coin; and liars and cheats. These Gentiles are brown people, well built and of good proportions, smart in their dress, and delicate and temperate in their food. Their victuals are milk, butter, sugar, rice, preserves of many kinds, many fruits, bread, vegetables, and field herbs; they all have gardens and orchards wherever they live, and many pools of water where they bathe twice every day, both men and women; and having ended their washing, they hold the belief that they are pardoned for all the sins which they have committed up to that time. They wear the hair very long like the women in Spain, and they wear it gathered on the top of the head, and made into a band which is much adorned, and upon this a cap to fasten it; and they always wear many flowers stuck into their hair, and sweet smelling things. They also anoint themselves with white sandal mixed with saffron and other scents; they are much given to fall in love. They go bare, only covering themselves from the waist downwards with very rich silk stuffs; they wear embroidered shoes of very good leather, well worked, and some short silk skirts, and other short ones of cotton, with which they cover their bodies. They do not carry arms, only some small knives garnished with gold and silver, for two reasons: one because they are persons who make little use of arms, the other because the Moors forbid it to them. They use many ear-rings of gold and jewellery in the ears, and many rings, and belts of gold and jewellery upon the cloths with which they gird themselves. The women of these Gentiles have very pretty, delicate faces, and well made bodies, a little dark. Their dress is silk stuff like their husbands' as far as the feet, and jackets with narrow sleeves of silk stuff, open at the shoulders, and other silk cloths with which they cover themselves in the manner of morisco almalafas; their heads bare, the hair gathered up upon the head; they wear thick ankle rings of gold and silver on the legs, and rings on their toes, and large coral beads on their arms, with beads of gold filigree, and gold and silver bracelets; and round their necks, necklaces of gold and jewellery, fitting closely; they have large holes pierced in their ears, and in them rings of gold or silver large enough for an egg to pass through them. They are modest women, and when they go out of their houses they are much covered up with their wraps over their heads. The other set of people are called Bramans, and are priests and the persons who administer and direct the idolatry; they have very large houses of prayer, some of them with revenues, others are maintained by alms. In these they keep many idols: some of stone, some of wood, and other of copper. In these houses and monasteries they always perform many ceremonies to their gods; they make feasts for them magnificently, with instruments and songs, and with many lights of oil, and they have bells in our fashion. These Bramans have got images which represent the Holy Trinity: they pay much honour to the number three, and in trine make their adoration to God, whom they confess to be the true God, Creator, and Maker of all things, which are three things in one sole person; and they say that there are many other gods governed by him, in which they also believe. These Bramans, wherever they find our churches, enter willingly into them, and adore our images; and they always ask for Santa Maria, our Lady, like men who have some knowledge of her. And as they see our manner of honouring the churches, they say that there is no great difference between them and us. These Bramans go bare from the waist upwards; they wear upon their shoulder a thread of three threads, which is a sign by which they are known to be Bramans. They are men who also do not eat anything which receives death, nor do they kill anything. They hold it to be a great ceremony to wash their bodies, and say that they wash on that account. These Bramans, and also the Banians, marry in our fashion, with one woman only, and only once. They make great feasts at their weddings, which last many days, and there are many people assembled at these very well dressed and decked out. These festivities are magnificent. For the most part they are married when very young, both men and women, and on the day of the betrothal, and of the wedding, the couple are both of them seated on a platform, very much bedizened with gold and jewellery and precious stones, and in front of them is a small table with an idol covered with flowers, and many lighted oil lamps all round it; and both of them have to remain there with their eyes fixed on that idol from the morning until the evening, without eating or drinking, or speaking to anybody during that time. The people make great rejoicings over them with their instruments and songs and dances; they let off many cannons, rockets and other fireworks to divert themselves. And if the husband dies the woman does not marry again, and so also does the husband should the wife die. And the children are his rightful heirs; and Bramans must be sons of Bramans, amongst whom there are some of a lower rank who serve as messengers and travellers, and they go in security to all parts without any one vexing them in any way. Even if there should be war or thieves, they always pass safely. These are called _pater_.\n [Text goes on about \"the King and the lords of Guzarat, which is of the Kingdom of Cambay.\"]",

    "Description":"Fifty leagues further along the coast, towards the south, there is a promontory, and joining close to it is a small island, which contains a very large and fine town, which the Malabars call Diuixa, and the Moors of the country call it Diu. It has a very good harbour, and is a port of much trade in merchandise, and of much shipping from Malabar, Baticala, Goa Dabul and Cheul; and the people of Diu sail to Aden, Mekkah, Zeyla, Barbara, Magadoxo, Brava, Melinde, Mombaza, Xer, Ormuz, and all parts of the kingdom. And the Malabars bring hither rice, cocoa nuts, jagara, wax, emery, iron, and sugar from Baticala, and all the spices that can be got in India and Malacca; and from Chaul and Dabul they bring a large quantity of cotton stuffs, which they call _beyranies_, and caps for women, which are carried from this place to Arabia and Persia. And they load at this port for the return voyage cotton cloths of the country and silk stuffs, horses, wheat, vegetables, sesame, cotton, oil of sesame, and opium, both that which comes there from Aden, and that which is made in the kingdom of Cambay, which is not so fine as that of Aden; and they export many coarse camlets and silk stuffs made in this kingdom of Cambay, and thick carpets, taffeta, scarlet cloth, and of other colours. They also export the spices and things brought to them from India, by the people of the country, to Aden, Ormuz, and all parts of Arabia and Persia, so that this town is the chief emporium of trade which exists in all these parts. This town gives such a large sum of money as revenue to the king, for the loading and unloading of such rich goods, that it is a subject of marvel and amazement; for they also bring to it from Mekkah much coral, copper, quicksilver, vermillion, lead, alum, madder, rose-water, saffron, and much gold and silver coined and uncoined. The king keeps a Moorish governor in this place called Melquiaz; an old man, and a very good gentleman, discreet, industrious, and of great information, who lives with great order and regularity in all his affairs. He makes much artillery, and has many rowing barges, very well arranged, small and very light, which are called Talayas. He has had constructed in the port a very strong and fine bulwark, in which he has very good artillery, with many lombards, and he always keeps with him many men-at-arms, to whom he pays very good appointments. They are very well armed. He is always on his guard, and is very apprehensive of the power of the King of Portugal. He shows great honour and attention to the ships and people of Portugal who come to his port. The people of his country are kept in very good order, and governed with much justice and good treatment; he dispenses many favours and presents to voyagers and strangers in his country.\n \n A large fleet of the Great Sultan of sailing ships and row galleys arrived at this port, well equipped, with large crews and a good armament; its captain was Emir Hussein. He came to reinforce himself in this port with the assistance of the king of Cambay and the before-mentioned governor Meliquiaz, and from thence to go to Calicut, to fight with the Portuguese, and turn them out of India. He was for some time in the port making many preparations, and the Portuguese fleet came there to seek for them, of which Don Francisco de Almeyda, viceroy of India, was the captain major. And the Moors put out to sea to meet them, and the two fleets fought in the entrance of this roadstead vigorously, and many people were killed and wounded on both sides; and at the end the Moors were beaten and captured with great slaughter, and the Portuguese took their ships and galleys, with all their arms and heavy artillery. They captured there many Moors, and the said Emir Hussein escaped, and left his fleet to suffer as has been told; and when Meliquiaz, who assisted and favoured them with his guard-boats and forces, saw the havoc, he at once sent messengers to the before-mentioned viceroy to seek peace of him, and he sent many provisions and refreshments and other presents as a sign of peace.",

And it is a very good town, a seaport of the same trade, because further up that river is the great city of Cambay. There arrived there many zambucos, which are small vessels of the Malabar country, with areca (nuts), spices, wax, sugar, cardamums, emery, ivory, and elephants: and these goods are sold there very well. And from there they carry away cotton, sesame, thread, wheat, peas, horses, alaquequas, and many other goods. The navigation of these places is very dangerous, especially for ships with keels which draw much water, because in this gulf which the coast here makes, the ebb and flow is so great, that in a very short space of time the sea leaves uncovered four or five leagues of dry land, and in some places less; and it is expedient for those who go in there to take country pilots, because, when the tide runs down, they may know how to remain in pools of deep water such as there are there, and sometimes they make mistakes and remain upon rocks, where they are lost.",

It is a very large city of handsome houses of stone and whitewash, very lofty, with windows, and covered with roofs in the Spanish fashion; it has very good streets and squares, and is situated in a rich, fertile, and pretty country, full of abundant provisions. There are in it rich merchants and men of great property, both Moors and Gentiles; and there are many workmen and mechanicians of subtle workmanship of all sorts, after the fashion of Flanders, and all very cheap. They make there many cloths of white cotton, fine and coarse, and other woven and coloured fabrics of all kinds; also many silk fabrics, of all kinds and colours; and camlets of silk and velvets of all colours, both smooth and fluffy, coloured tafetans, and thick alcatifas. The inhabitants of this city are all white, both men and women, and there are many people from outside living in it who are very white and very well dressed, and of luxurious lives, much given to pleasure and amusement. They are very much accustomed to wash themselves; they eat very well, and always go perfumed and anointed with sweet smelling things. They wear in their hair, both men and women, many jessamine and other flowers that grow amongst them. They have many musicians, and various kinds of instruments and songs. There are always carts with oxen and horses going about the city, of which they make use for everything; and they go in these with rich mattrasses, shut up and well fitted up with their windows, after the manner of cabins; furnished and ornamented with silk stuffs, and the seats within with cushions and pillows of silk and stamped kid skins: and with their waggoners. Men and women go in these to see amusements and diversions, or to visit their friends, or wherever they wish, without being known, and they see all that they wish. And they go singing and playing on instruments in these same waggons for their amusement. And these people possess many orchards and gardens, where they go to take their ease, and where they grow much fruit and vegetables for the sustenance of the gentiles, who do not eat meat nor flesh. In this city a very large quantity of ivory is employed in very delicate works, well known in commerce, like inlaid works of gold, and things made by turning, and handles of knives and daggers, bracelets, games of chess and chess-boards. There are also great artists with the turning lathe, who make large bedsteads, and they make beads of great size, brown, yellow, blue and coloured, which they export to all parts. There are also great lapidaries, and imitators of precious stones of all kinds, and makers of false pearls which seem real. So also there are very good silversmiths of very skilful workmanship. In this city they make very delicate cushions, and pretty ceilings (or canopies) of bedsteads, of delicate workmanship and paintings, and quilted clothes for wearing. There are many Moorish women who produce very delicate needlework. They work there too in coral alaquequas and other stones.",

This place is one of great commerce in merchandise, and in the months of December, January, February and March there are many ships from the Malabar country and all other parts, which arrive with cargoes. That is to say, those of Malabar laden with cocoa nuts, arecas, spices, drugs, palm sugar, emery, and there they make their sales for the continent and for the kingdom of Cambay; and the ships of Cambay come there to meet them laden with cotton stuffs, and many other goods which are available in Malabar, and these are bartered for the goods which have come from the Malabar country. And on the return voyage they fill their ships with wheat, vegetables, millet, rice, sesame, oil of sesame, of which there is much in this country; and these Malabars also buy many pieces of fine muslin for women's head dress, and many beyranies, of which there are plenty in this kingdom. A large quantity of copper is sold in this port of Cheul, and at a high price, for it is worth twenty ducats the hundred weight, or more, because in the interior money is made of it, and it is also used throughout the country for cooking pots. There is also a great consumption in this place of quicksilver and vermilion for the interior, and for the kingdom of Guzarat, which copper, quicksilver and vermilion is brought to this place by the Malabar merchants, who get it from the factories of the King of Portugal; and they get more of it by way of the Mekkah, which comes there from Diu. These people wear the beyranies put on for a few days nearly in the raw state, and afterwards they bleach them and make them very white, and gum them to sell them abroad, and thus some are met with amongst them which are torn. In this port of Chaul there are few inhabitants, except during three or four months of the year, the time for putting in cargo, when there arrive merchants from all the neighbourhood, and they make their bargains during this period, and despatch their goods, and after that return to their homes until the next season, so that this place is like a fair in those months. There is a Moorish gentleman as governor of this place, who is a vassal of the King of Decani, and collects his revenues, and accounts to him for them. He is called Xech, and does great service to the King of Portugal, and is a great friend of the Portuguese, and treats very well all those that go there, and keeps the country very secure. In this place there is always a Portuguese factor appointed by the captain and factor of Goa, in order to send from this place provisions and other necessaries, to the city of Goa, and to the Portuguese fleets; and at a distance of about a league inland from Cheul is a place where the Moors and Gentiles of the cities and towns throughout the country come to set up their shops of goods and cloths at Cheul during the before-mentioned months; they bring these in great caravans of domestic oxen, with packs like donkeys, and on the top of these long white sacks placed crosswise, in which they bring their goods; and one man drives thirty or forty beasts before him.",

A fleet of the King of Portugal arrived at this city, of which the viceroy was the captain, and landed his people on the shore for the purpose of taking and destroying this town. And the Moors put themselves on the defensive, and fought very courageously with the Portuguese. In the fight many Moors and Gentiles died, and at last the Portuguese took this city by assault, making a great slaughter of the inhabitants, and plundering and burning the city, in which much wealth and merchandise were burned, and at the same time several ships which were lying in the river. And those who escaped thence returned later to restore this city, so that now it is already inhabited as before.",

They always go about eating this leaf, which they mix with some small fruits called arecas, and the leaf is smeared with moistened lime, which is made with sea-shells, and the shells of oysters and mussels. And these three things being added together, they eat this betel, not swallowing more than the juice; and it colours the mouth and makes the teeth brown: and they say that it is good for drying and purging the stomach, and for preserving the brain, and it drives out flatulence, and quenches thirst: so that it is very much esteemed among all Indians, and in general use from this place further on throughout India. There are great quantities of it, and it is one of the principal revenues which the kings of the country possess. The Moors and Arabs and Persians call it tanbul.

And leaving this place, between it and Goa there is another river called Bardes, on which there are other towns which are not of much trade.",

    "Description":"Leaving these places, there are twenty leagues of coast southwards as far as a cape, which must be doubled to enter Goa; and after that ten leagues to the north-west, then ten more to the east, and south-south-west twenty leagues, then seventeen leagues to the north-west, as far as the Cape Rama. And in this gulf there are many small islands, the chief of which is Goa. There is a large river which issues by two branches into the sea, between which is formed the island of the city of Goa, which belonged to the kingdom of Decani, and was a lordship of itself along with other towns in the neighbourhood; and the king gave it to a vassal of his, a great lord called Vasabaxo, who was a very good knight, and on account of his being very distinguished and skilful in warlike matters, this lordship of Goa was given him, in order that he might carry on war thence with the King of Narsinga, as he always did until his death. This city then remained to his son, Sabaym Delcani, and it was inhabited by many Moors, respectable men, and foreigners, white men and rich merchants, and several of them are very good gentlemen. There are also many great Gentile merchants, and others, gentlemen and cultivators, and men-at-arms. It was a place of great trade in merchandise. It has a very good port, to which flocked many ships from Mekkah, Aden, Ormuz, Cambay, and the Malabar country. And the before mentioned Sabaym Delcani resided much in this place, and he kept there his captain and men-at-arms, and no one entered or went out of this island and city, either by sea or by land, without his permission; and all those who entered there were registered with all their signs and particulars, and from whence they came; and so, with this precaution and arrangement, they allowed them to return. This town was very large, with goodly edifices and handsome streets and squares, surrounded by walls and towers. There is a very good fortress in it, and in the environs many gardens and orchards of fine trees and fruits, and many pools of good water. There were many mosques and houses of worship of the Gentiles. The country all round was very fruitful and well cultivated, and enjoyed much produce both from sea and land. This Sabaym, as soon as he knew that the Portuguese viceroy had routed the Rumes and the fleet of the great sultan before Diu, immediately sent to call the Rumes, knights, and other people of the sultan, who having escaped thence, arrived, leaving their captain in the kingdom of Guzarat. And this Sabaym Delcani received them very well, and determined on putting all India at their disposition for their assistance, and to refit them again with the aid of all the Moors and kings of India, in order to again carry on war against the Portuguese. They then collected together much money and began to build in this city of Goa very large ships, and handsome galleys and brigantines, all after the manner and fashion of ours, and likewise to prepare much artillery of brass and iron, and all other munitions of maritime war. And the Moors were so expeditious in this that they had got a large part of the fleet made, and vast magazines of munitions for the fleet; and they already went out with guard boats and rowing galleys, to take the Sambuks which passed by, because they carried Portuguese safe-conducts. And Alfonso de Albuquerque, who was then captain-major in India, had information of all this, and determined to go and seek them, and drive them from their design. He therefore collected the most that he could of a fleet of ships, caravels, and galleys, and with these entered the before mentioned river, and attacked the city of Goa and took it. Upon which many great things occurred, which I say nothing about, in order not to be more prolix. He captured many people, and all the ships and galleys of the Rumes, and he burned some of them; and the city submitted to the commands of the King of Portugal, as it now is. And he fortified it with several castles. This city is inhabited by Portuguese, Moors and Gentiles; and the fruits of the earth and provisions now produce a yearly revenue to the King of Portugal of twenty thousand ducats, without the port, which has much trade in merchandise of Malabar, Cheul, Dabul, Cambay and Diu. They sell there many horses for other parts, at two, three and four hundred ducats each, according to their quality, and upon each the King of Portugal levies forty ducats as duty; and although they pay less dues than in the time of the Moors, this harbour produces much revenue to the King of Portugal.",

    "Description":"Beyond this river commences the kingdom of Narsinga, which contains five very large provinces, with a language of their own. One province is along the coast, and is called Tulinat; another has the name of Legni, which confines with the kingdom of Tisa; another is Canari, in which is the great city of Visenagar, and the other is Chomendel, a kingdom which they call Tamul. This kingdom of Narsinga is very rich and well supplied with provisions, and is very full of cities and large townships; and all the country is very fertile and brought into cultivation. The province of Tulinat contains many rivers and seaports, in which there is much trade and shipping bound for all parts, and many rich merchants dwell in them. Between the others there is a very large river called Mergeo, from which is produced a large quantity of inferior rice for the common people, which the Malabars come here to buy, with their sambuks, in exchange for cocoa nuts, oil, and jagra, which are much used in this country.\n \n [See call outs.]\n \n Leaving this sea coast, and going inland into the kingdom of Narsinga, at twelve or fifteen leagues distance there is a very high mountain range, precipitous and difficult of ascent, which stretches from the beginning of this kingdom to Cape Comeri, which is beyond the Malabar country; and the before-mentioned province of Tulinat is at the foot of this range, between it and the sea. And the Indians say that in former times all these low grounds were sea, which reached to the said range, and that in process of time the sea uncovered it, and swelled it up in other parts, and to the foot of those mountains. There are many traces of things of the sea, and all the low ground is very level like the sea, and the mountain chain is very craggy, and seems to rise to the heavens; and it is not possible to ascend, except in a few parts, and with difficulty, which is a cause of great strength to the Malabars, for were it not for the difficulty of entering their country on account of the roughness of these mountains, the King of Narsinga would already have conquered them. This range is peopled in several parts, with good towns and villages, very luxuriant in water and delicious fruit: and in it there are many wild boars, and large and fine deer, many leopards, ounces, lions, tigers, bears, and some animals of an ashy colour, which look like horses, very active, and which cannot be caught. There are serpents with wings, which fly, very venomous, so that their breath and looks kill whatever person places himself very near them, and they always go amongst the trees. There are also many wild elephants, and many stones of gegonzas, amethysts, and soft sapphires, are found in the rivers where they are deposited. They carry them from the mountains to sell them in the Malabar towns, where they are wrought. After passing this mountain range, the country is almost entirely plain, very fertile and abundantly supplied in the inland districts, which belong to the kingdom of Narsinga, in which there are many cities and villages and forts, and many large rivers run through it. There is in this country much cultivation of rice and other vegetables, with which they maintain themselves, and many cows, buffaloes, pigs, goats, sheep, asses, and diminutive ponies, all of which they make use of; and they carry their goods by means of buffaloes, oxen, asses, and ponies, and do their field work with them. Almost all the villages are of Gentiles, and among them are a few Moors; some of the lords of these villages are of these last, to whom the king of Narsinga has granted the villages, and others are his, and he keeps his governors and tax collectors in them.\n \n [See text for more about customs.]",

    "Description":"Ten leagues further along this coast to the south is another small river, with a large town called Baticala, of very great trade in merchandise, inhabited by many Moors and Gentiles, very commercial people. And at this port congregate many ships from Orguz, to load very good white rice, sugar in powder, of which there is much in this country, for they do not know how to make it in loaves; and it is worth at the rate of two hundred and forty maravedis the arroba. They likewise load much iron, and these three kinds of goods are what are chiefly shipped at this place: and also some spices and drugs, which the Malabars import. There are many myrobalans of all sorts, and very good preserves are made with them, which the ships of Ormuz, which traffic at this place, export for the Arabs and Persians. They used each year to bring to this port many horses and pearls, which were there sold for the whole kingdom of Narsinga, and now they take them all to the city of Goa, on account of the Portuguese. Some ships are also laden at this place for Aden, risking themselves, although it is forbidden them by the Portuguese. Many Malabar ships and sambuks also come to this port to take in rice, sugar, and iron; and they bring cocoa nuts, palm sugar, cocoa nut oil, and palm wine, in return for these things, and spices and drugs, concealed from the Portuguese who prohibit them. This town produces much revenue to the king. Its governor is a Gentile; he is named Damaqueti. He is very rich in money and jewels. The king of Narsinga has given this place and others to a nephew of his, who rules and governs them, and lives in great State and calls himself king, but he is in obedience to the king his uncle. In this kingdom they make a great practice of duelling, for on account of anything they at once challenge one another, and the king at once grants them a field and arms, and appoints a time for killing each other, and gives them seconds, who back up each his own man. They go to fight one another bare from the waist upwards, and from the waist downwards wrapped in cotton cloths drawn tightly round, and with many folds, and with their arms, which are swords, bucklers and daggers. And the king appoints them of equal length. They enter the lists with great pleasure, first saying their prayers, and in a very few passes they kill each other in the presence of the king and many people, without any one speaking except the seconds, of whom each encourages his own man. This town of Baticala pays a yearly tribute to the king of Portugal; much copper is also sold in it each year, which is taken into the interior of the country to make money, and cauldrons and other pans which they use. There is also sold there much quicksilver, vermilion, coral, alum and ivory. This town is situated in level country, it is very populous, and not walled; it is surrounded with many gardens, very good estates, and very fresh and abundant water. There is in this place gold coin called Pardan, and it is worth three hundred and twenty maravedis; and there is another silver coin called _dama_, worth twenty. The weights are called bahars, and each bahar is equal to four quintals of Portugal.",

They gather the harvest twice every year from this watery land, and it is of four sorts of rice. The first they call girazat, which is the best; the second jani bazal, the third camagar, and the fourth pachari: each one has its price, and there is a great difference between one and the other.",

He is a Gentile and is called Raheni: he has in this place very large and handsome palaces, with numerous courts in which are many mounds, pools of water with plenty of fish, gardens of shrubs, flowers, and sweet-smelling herbs. There are also in the city many other palaces of great lords who live there. And all the other houses of the place are covered with thatch, and the streets and squares are very wide: they are constantly filled with an innumerable crowd of all nations and creeds; for, besides many Moorish merchants and traders, and the Gentile inhabitants of the country who are very rich, an infinite number of others flock there from all parts, who are able to come, dwell, trade, and live very freely and in security, without anyone molesting them, or asking or requiring of them any account of whence they come, or in what creed they live, whether they be Moors, Christians, or Gentiles; and each one may live according to any creed, or as he pleases. There is an infinite trade in this city, and strict justice and truth are observed towards all by the governors of the country. In this city there are very many jewels which are brought from Pegu and Celani, and in the country itself many diamonds are found, because there is a mine of them in the kingdom of Narsinga and another in the kingdom of Dacani. There are also many pearls and seed-pearls to be found there, which are brought from Ormus and Cael; and all these jewels and pearls are much esteemed among them, because they adorn themselves much with them, and on that account a great quantity are poured in. In this city they wear many silks and inferior brocades, which are brought from China and Alexandria, and much scarlet cloth, and of other colours, and much coral worked into round beads; and they import copper, quicksilver, vermilion, saffron, rose-water, much anfiani which is opium, sandal and aloes wood, camphor, musk, because the inhabitants of this country are much in the habit of anointing themselves with these perfumes.\n \n There is also a great consumption in this place, and in the whole kingdom, of pepper, which is brought from Malabar on oxen and asses. The money is of gold, and is called parda, and is worth three hundred maravedis; it is coined in certain cities of this kingdom of Narsinga, and throughout all India they use this money, which passes in all those kingdoms; its gold is a little inferior.

This kingdom is of the Moors, and has a Moorish king, a great lord; and in former times this kingdom was of the Gentiles, of whom there are still many who live amidst the Moors, with much vexation. And many of them nobles and respectable people, not to be subject to the Moors, go out of the kingdom and take the habit of poverty, wandering the world; and they never settle in any country until their death; nor will they possess any property, since they lost their lands and property, and for that go naked, barefooted, and bareheaded; they only cover their nakedness with coverings of brass, in this manner: it must be said, that they wear belts of Moorish brass of pieces fitted together, of four fingers in breadth, carved with many images of men and women, sculptured and shining: and they wear it so tight that it makes their guts rise high up; and from the girdle below the hips there comes a bandage of the same brass, and in front it forms a sort of braguette, which comes and fastens in the girdle in front with its fastenings: all very tight. Besides this, they carry very heavy chains round their necks, and waists, and legs; and they smear all their bodies and faces with ashes. And they carry a small brown horn at their necks, after the fashion of a trumpet, with which they call and beg for food at the door of any house where they arrive: chiefly at the houses of kings and great lords and at the temples; and they go many together, like the gipsies. They are accustomed to stop very few days in each country. These people are commonly called jogues, and in their own speech they are called zoame, which means servant of God. They are brown, very well made and proportioned, of handsome faces; they wear their hair without ever combing it, and made into many plaits, wound round the head. And I asked them many times why they went in this fashion. And they answered me, that they wore those chains upon their bodies as penance for the sin which they committed for allowing themselves to be captured by such bad people as the Moors, and that they went naked as a sign of dishonour, because they had allowed their lands and houses to be lost, in which God brought them up; and that they did not want more property since they had lost their own, for which they ought to have died; and that they smeared themselves with ashes in order to remind themselves perpetually that they were born of earth and had to return again to the earth, and that all the rest was falsehood. And each one of them carries his little bag of these ashes with him; and all the Gentiles of the country honour them greatly, and receive from them some of these ashes, and put it on their heads, shoulders, and breasts, making a few lines with it. And throughout all the country the Gentiles are in the habit of doing this. And so also throughout all India among the Gentiles, many of them turn jogues; but most of them are from the kingdom of Dely. These jogues eat all meats and do not observe any idolatry, and they mingle with all kinds of people: neither do they wash like other Gentiles, except when the wish to do so comes to them.\n \n In this kingdom of Dely there are many very good horses, which are born and bred there. The people of the kingdom, both Moors and Gentiles, are very good fighting men and good knights, armed with many kinds of weapons; they are great bowmen, and very strong men; they have very good lances, swords, daggers, steel maces, and battle-axes, with which they fight; and they have some steel wheels, which they call chacarani, two fingers broad, sharp outside like knives, and without edge inside; and the surface of these is of the size of a small plate. And they carry seven or eight of these each, put on the left arm; and they take one and put it on the finger of the right hand, and make it spin round many times, and so they hurl it at their enemies, and if they hit anyone on the arm or leg or neck, it cuts through all. And with these they carry on much fighting, and are very dexterous with them.\n \n This king of Dely confines with Tatars, and has taken many lands from the King of Cambay; and from the King of Dacan, his servants and captains, with many of his people, took much, and afterwards in time they revolted and set themselves up as kings. In this kingdom of Dely there are some trees, the root of which is called Baxarague, and it is so poisonous that any one who eats it dies at once; and its fruit is called Nirabixy, and it is of such virtue that it extinguishes all poison, and gives life to any one poisoned with the said root or with other poisons. These jogues, who come from the kingdom of Dely, carry this root and fruit; some of them give it to some Indian kings; and so likewise they carry with them sometimes rhinoceros' horn and Pajar stone, which possess great virtue against all poisons. And this stone, Pajar, is grey and soft, of the size of an almond; and they say that it is found in the head of an animal: it is greatly esteemed amongst the Indians.",

    "Description":"[Random spot on Malabar Coast]\n \n Having passed the province of Tulynate, which is of the kingdom of Narsinga, along the coast of the sea, which province begins from Cinbola near the mountain Dely, and ends at the Cape of Conmery, which is a distance of seventy leagues along the coast towards the south and south-east. And there begins the country of Malabar, which was governed by a king who was called Sernaperimal, who was a very great lord. And after that the Moors of Mekkah discovered India, and began to navigate near it, which was six hundred and ten years ago; they used to touch at this country of Malabar on account of the pepper which is found there. And they began to load their ships with it in a city and seaport, Coulom, where the king used frequently to be. And so for some years these Moors continued their voyages to this country of Malabar, and began to spread themselves through it, and became so intimate and friendly with the said king, that they made him turn Moor, and he went away with them to die at the house of Mekkah, and he died on the road. And before he set out from his country, he divided the whole of his kingdom of Malabar amongst his relations; and it remained divided amongst them and their descendants as it now is. And when he distributed the lands, he abandoned those that he gave, never to return to them again; and at last, when he had given away all, and there did not remain anything more for him to give, except ten or twelve leagues of land all round the spot from which he embarked, which was an uninhabited beach, where now stands the city of Calicut. And at that moment he was accompanied by more Moors than Gentiles, on account of having given to the latter almost all that he possessed, and he had with him only one young nephew, who waited on him as a page, to whom he gave that piece of land; and he told him to get it peopled, especially that very spot whence he embarked. And he gave him his sword and a chandelier, which he carried with him for state. And he left an injunction to the other lords, his relations to whom he had made grants of lands, that they should obey him, only leaving exempt the King of Coulam and the King of Cavanor: so that he instituted three kings in the country of Malabar, and commanded that no one should coin money except the King of Calicut. And so he embarked at the same place where the city of Calicut was founded; and the Moors held this time and place in much veneration, and would not after that go and load pepper any more in any other part since the said king embarked there after becoming a Moor and going to die at Mekkah. This city of Calicut is very large, and ennobled by many very rich merchants and great traffic in goods. This king became greater and more powerful than all the others: he took the name of Zomodri, which is a point of honour above all other kings. So that this great King of Malabar did not leave more kings than these three: that is to say, the Zomodry, who was named Cunelava-dyri, and the King of Culaon, who was named Benate-diry, and the King of Cananor, who was named Coletry. And there are many other lords in the country of Malabar, who wish to call themselves kings; and they are not so, because they are not able to coin money, nor cover houses with roofs under penalty of all the others rising up against whomsoever should do such a thing, or of having to destroy them. And these kings of Culam and Cananor afterwards struck money for a certain time in their countries without having the power of doing so. In all the country they use one language, which is called Maleama, and all the kings are of one sect, and almost of the same customs.\n \n In these kingdoms of Malabar there are eighteen sects of Gentiles, each one of which is much distinguished from the others in so great a degree that the ones will not touch the others under pain of death or dishonour or loss of their property: and all of them have separate customs in their idol-worship, as will be set forth further on.",

These kill with their bite, and the person bitten dies in two hours, though he sometimes lasts two or three days. Many mountebanks carry some of these alive in earthen jars, and charmed so that they do not bite, and with them they gain money, putting them round their necks, and exhibiting them.

We call these fruits cocoas: these trees give their fruits the whole year without any intermission; and there are others which support the people of Malabar, so that they cannot suffer famine even though all other provisions should fail them: because these cocoas, both green and dry, are very sweet and agreeable, and they give milk, like that of almonds. Now each of these cocoas when green has inside it a quart of water very fresh, savoury, and cordial; it is very nourishing, and when they are dried that water congeals inside in a white fruit the size of an apple, which is very sweet and delicious: they eat the cocoa also when dry. They make much oil of these cocoas in presses as we do, and with the rind which these cocoa-nuts have close to the marrow, they make charcoal for the silversmiths, who do not work with any other charcoal. And with another husk which it has outside the first, which makes many threads, they weave cordage, which is a great article of trade; and from these trees they make wine with the sap, which is like spirits, and in such great quantities, that many ships are laden with it. With the same wine they make very good vinegar, and they also make very sweet sugar, which is yellow like honey, and is a great article of trade in India. With the leaves of the tree they make mats of the size of the leaf, with which they cover all their houses instead of with tiles: and with the tree they also make wood for their houses and for other services, and firewood. And of all these things there is so great abundance that ships are laden with them. There are other palm trees of other kinds, and shorter, from which the leaves are gathered upon which the Gentiles write. There are other palms, slender and very lofty, and of very clean stems, upon which grow clusters of fruit the size of walnuts (which the Indians eat with the betel, which we call Folio Indio), and they call Areca. It is much esteemed among them and is very acid: there is such a quantity of it that they fill many ships with it for Cambay and the kingdom of Decan, and many other parts, after drying and packing it.",

The King of Portugal has a very good fortress at the mouth of this river, all round which is a large village of Portuguese and Christians, natives of the country, who were baptised since the Portuguese have inhabited the country; and every day many more are converted. And there are likewise many of the above-named Christians of the doctrine of Saint Thomas, who come there from Culan and other Gentile places, where they are accustomed to live. In this fortress and town of Cochin there is much machinery and apparatus for caulking and refitting ships, and also galleys and caravels, with as much perfection as in our parts. And much pepper is put on board at this place, and spices and drugs which come from Malacca and which are transported every year to Portugal.\n \n This King of Cochin has but a small country, and he was not a king before the Portuguese went there, because all the kings of Calicut when newly come into power, had the custom of entering Cochin and depriving the king of his state and taking possession of it, and afterwards they restored it to him again for life. The King of Calicut observed this as a law, and the King of Cochin used to give him a tribute of elephants, and so he returned to Calicut. And the King of Cochin could not coin money, nor roof his houses with tiles, under pain of losing his state. And now since the Portuguese went there, the King of Portugal made him exempt from all this; so that he lords it absolutely and coins money according to his custom.",

    "Description":"Further on along the same coast towards the south is a great city and good seaport, which is named Coulam, in which dwell many Moors and Gentiles, and Christians. They are great merchants and very rich, and own many ships, with which they trade to Cholmendel, the Island of Ceylon, Bengal, Malaca, Samatara, and Pegu: these do not trade with Cambay. There is also in this city much pepper. They have a Gentile king, a great lord of much territory and wealth, and of numerous men at arms, who for the most part are great archers. At this city, withdrawn a little from it, there is a promontory in the sea where stands a very great church which the apostle St. Thomas built miraculously before he departed this life. It must be known that on arriving at this city of Coulan where all were Gentiles, in a poor habit, and going along converting some poor people to our holy faith he brought with him a few companions natives of the country, although they were very few: and while he was in this city, one morning there was found in this port of Coulam a very large piece of timber which had been stranded on the sea-beach, and news of it was immediately brought to the king. He sent many people and elephants to draw it out upon dry land, but they could never move it; and the king himself went in person to it later, and they were unable to draw it out. And as soon as St. Thomas saw them despair of the timber, he went to the king, and said to him: \"If I were to draw out this timber would you give me a piece of land upon which to build a church with it, to the praise of our Lord God, Who sent me here.\" And the king laughed at him, and said to him: \"If you see that with all my power it cannot be dragged out, how do you hope to draw it out.\" And Saint Thomas answered him: \"To draw it out by the power of God, which is greater.\" The king immediately ordered all the land which he asked for this purpose to be given to him. And when it was granted to him, by the grace of the Lord, he went alone to the timber, and tied a cord to it, with which he began to draw it on shore without anyone assisting him. And the timber followed behind him as far as the place where he wished to build the church. The king seeing such a miracle commanded that they should let him do what he pleased with the timber and the land which had been given him; and that he should be shewn favour, because he held him to be a holy man. But he did not choose to turn Christian, and many people became converted to our holy faith. And the said Apostle whom they call Martoma, called many carpenters and sawyers of the country, and began to have the timber worked, and it was so large that it was sufficient by itself for the building of the whole church. And it is a custom amongst the Indians that when the workmen or any persons are going to set to work, the master of the work gives them at midday a certain quantity of rice to eat, and at night he gives to each man a small coin of inferior gold called fanam. And St. Thomas at midday took a measure full of sand, and gave to each of these workmen his measure, which turned into very good rice, and at night he gave to each one a little bit of the wood which he was hewing, and they turned into fanams; so that they went away well satisfied, and so the said Apostle finished the church of Coulam. And when those people saw these miracles and many others which our Lord did by this glorious saint, many Indians turned to the Christian faith, through the whole kingdom of Coulam, which reaches to the frontier of Ceylon, so that there are more than two thousand houses of Christians scattered throughout the country among the Gentiles; and they have a few churches, but most of them are deficient in teaching and some of them wanting in baptism. And when the King of the Indians saw so great a change he feared that if he gave more opportunity for it, the said Christians would multiply so much that they would be able to rise and possess the country. And so he began to persecute the said St. Thomas, who withdrew himself to Cholmendel, and then to a city which was called Muylepur, where he received martyrdom, and there he is buried, as will be mentioned hereafter. And so the Christians remained in the kingdom of Coulam with the before mentioned church which St. Thomas built, and with others about the country. This church was endowed by the King of Coulam with the revenue from the pepper, which remains to it to this day. These Christians had not any Christian doctrine amongst them, nor were they baptized, only they held and believed the faith of Christ in a gross manner. And at a certain period they held a council amongst them and sent men about the world to study the Christian doctrine, and manner of baptism; these men reached Armenia, where they found many Greek Christians and a patriarch who governed them, who seeing their good intention sent with them a bishop and six priests to baptize them and administer the sacraments and perform divine service, and indoctrinate them in the Christian faith. And these remain there for five or six years and then are relieved for an equal period of time, and so on. And in this manner they improved themselves somewhat. These Armenians are white men; they speak Arabic, and have the sacred scriptures in Chaldean, and recite the offices in that language in our fashion. They wear tonsures on their heads the opposite of ours; that is to say, that, where ours shave they wear hair, and where we have the hair they shave it. They go dressed in white shirts and caps on their heads, barefooted, and with long beards; they are very devout people, and say mass on altars like ours with a cross (+) in front of them. And he who says mass is in the middle of the altar, and those who assist him are at the sides. They communicate with salt bread instead of a wafer, and they consecrate of that bread enough for all that are in the church, and they give it to all of them divided like blessed bread. Each one who communicates goes to receive it at the foot of the altar with his hand. The wine is in this manner, because there is no wine in India; they take raisins which come from Mekkah and Ormuz, and put them for a night in water; and on the next day when they have to say mass they squeeze them and with the juice they say their mass. These priests baptize for money, and go away from this country of Malabar very rich when they return to their own country. And many remain unbaptized for want of money.",

    "Description":"Over against Panam, Cochin, and Coulam, to the west and south-west, at a distance of seventy-five leagues are other islands, of which ten or twelve are inhabited by Moors, brown and small in stature, who have a separate language and a Moorish king who resides in an island called Mahaldiu. And they call all these islands Palandiva. The inhabitants are ill-formed and weak, but are very ingenious and charming. Their king is elected by some Moorish merchants, inhabitants of Cananor, and they change him when they please. These persons receive tribute of him every year in cordage and other produce of the country. They go there to load their ships without money, because the people of the country, with or against their will, have to give these said Moors whatever they wish. There is much fish in these islands, of which they prepare much dried, which is a great article of trade. And as ballast for the ships which take on board these things, they carry away sea-snails, which are worth a good deal in many parts, and in some, especially Cambay, they serve as small change. Many fine cotton cloths are manufactured in these islands, and others of silk and gold, which are worth a good deal amongst the Moors. They gather much amber in these islands, of a good quality and in large pieces, white, grey, and brown; and I asked several of these Moors various times how the amber was produced: they hold that it is the droppings of birds, and say that in this archipelago in the uninhabited islands there are some large birds which perch on the rocks near the sea, and there void that amber, which becomes refined by exposure to the air, the sun and the rain, until some storms arise and gales of wind, which drive the sea waves over the rocks, and this bird-dung is torn off the rocks in large and small pieces, and so carried out to sea, where it floats till they meet with it, or it is cast up on some beach, or that some whales swallow it. And they say that what is found of a white colour, and which they call ponabar, has been in the sea only for a short time, and this they value most highly amongst themselves; and that the other which is found of a greyish colour, and which they name puambar, has been, they say, in the sea for a long time, and has taken that colour from floating about in the water; this also is very good, but not equal to the white; and what they find of a brown colour and bruised, has been swallowed, they say, by whales, and turned brown in their bodies, and that it has such a quality that the whale cannot digest it, and they eject it whole just as they swallowed it; this they call minabar, and it is that which among them has least value. In these isles of Maldiva they construct many large ships of palm tree, sewn together with matting, for there is no other wood there. Some of these sail to the mainland, and are ships with keels and of much tonnage; they also construct there other small rowing vessels, like brigantines and _fustas_, very pretty and good for rowing, which they use to go from one island to another; and they likewise cross over to the Malabar country. Many Moorish ships touch at these islands from China, Malacojana, Malaca, Samatra, Bengala, Ceylan, and Peygu, on their passage to the Red Sea: and there they take in water and refreshments for their voyage. Sometimes they arrive so shattered that they unload their cargo there, and they let it be lost. Many of these ships get lost amongst these islands because they do not venture to come to the Malabar coast from fear of the Portuguese.",

    "Description":"Leaving these islands of Mahaldiva further on towards the east, where the cape of Comory is doubled, at thirty-eight leagues from the cape itself, there is a very large and beautiful island which the Moors, Arabs, Persians, and our people call Ceylam, and the Indians call it Ylinarim. It is a rich and luxuriant land, inhabited by Gentiles, and ruled by a Gentile king. Many Moors live in the seaports of this island in large quarters, and all the inhabitants are great merchants. There are fifty leagues of channel towards the north-east from the said cape until passing the island of Maylepur. Both Moors and Gentiles are well-made men, and almost white, and for the most part stout, with large stomachs, and luxurious. They do not understand, nor possess arms, they are all given to trade and to good living. They go bare from the waist upwards, and below that cover themselves with good cloths of silk and cotton, caps on their heads, and the ears pierced with large holes in which they wear many gold rings and jewellery, so much that their very ears reach to their shoulders: and many rings and precious jewels on their fingers; they wear belts of gold richly adorned with precious stones. Their language is partly Malabar and partly of Cholmendel, and many Malabar Moors come to live in this island on account of its being so luxuriant, abundant, and very healthy. Men live longer here than in other parts of India. They have a great deal of very good fruit; and the mountains are full of sweet and sour oranges of three or four kinds, and plenty of lemons and citrons, and many other very good fruits which do not exist in our parts, and they last all the year. And there is plenty of meat and fish, little rice, for most of it comes from Cholmendel, and it is their chief food; much good honey and sugar brought from Bengal, and butter of the country. All the good cinnamon grows in this island upon the mountains, on trees which are like laurels. And the king of the country orders it to be cut in small sticks, and has the bark stripped off in certain months of the year, and sells it himself to the merchants who go there to buy it, because no one can gather it except the king. There are likewise in this island many wild elephants which the king orders to be caught and tamed; and they sell them to merchants of Cholmendel, Narsynga, and Malabar, and those of the kingdoms of Decam and Cambay go to those places to buy them. These elephants are caught in this manner: it must be known that they have got other elephants with which they manage it, and they fasten them with chains in the mountains and woods where they are bred; and at the foot and all round a tree near the elephant they make three or four very large pits, covered over with slender poles, and they strew earth on the top, so that nothing appears: and the wild elephants seeing the female come to her, and fall into these pits, where they keep them seven or eight days half-dead of hunger, and so many men watch them by day and night, always speaking to them so as not to let them sleep, until they tame and render them domestic, giving them their food with their hands. And after they have got them broken in and tame, they take them with strong chains, and by degrees throw so much earth and branches into the pit that the elephant gradually rises until he comes out of the pit, and then they tie him to some tree and keep him some days watching, with fire, and men who always talk to him, and give him food in moderation until they make him domestic and obedient. And in this way they catch them male and female, great and small, and sometimes two at once in one pit. They make great merchandise of them, and they are worth much, because they are much valued by the kings of India for war and for labour, and they become as domestic and quick at understanding as men. The very good ones are worth in the Malabar country and in Cholmendel from a thousand to one thousand five hundred ducats, and the others from four to six hundred ducats according as they may be, but in the island they are to be had for a small price. And all have to be brought and presented to the king. There are also many jewels in this island, rubies which they call manica, sapphires, jacinths, topazes jagonzas, chrysoliths, and cat's eyes, which are as much esteemed amongst the Indians as rubies. And all these stones are all gathered in by the king, and sold by himself. And he has men who go and dig for them in the mountains and shores of the rivers, who are great lapidaries and who are good judges in those matters: so much so that if they have a few handfuls of earth brought them from the mountain, at once on seeing it they know if it is of rubies or of any other stones, and where it comes from. And the king sends them to look there, and after they have brought them he orders to set aside each kind, and pick out the good ones, and he has them worked to have them sold when cut, which he does himself to foreigners; and the other inferior ones he sells at once to the country merchants. These rubies which grow here, for the most part, are not of so brilliant a colour as these which grow in Ava and Capelam, of which mention will be made further on; and some which come out perfect in colour are much more highly prized by the Indians than those of Paygu, because they say that they are stronger. And in order to make them of a deeper colour they put them into the fire. These lapidaries whom the king has near him, on seeing a stone before it is cut, say: this ruby will endure so many hours of fire, and will remain very good. And the king risks it, and orders it to be put in a very strong charcoal fire for that space of time which the lapidary has mentioned to him: and if it endures it without danger, it comes out more perfect in colour, and is worth very much. And all the other stones are found and worked in the same manner: and some stones are found which are half ruby and half sapphire, and others half topaze and half sapphires, and also cat's eyes. The king has a great treasure of these jewels, for whenever he meets with any very good stone he puts it in his treasury.",

And they bring gold and silver, cotton and silk stuffs from Cambay, and many other goods which are saffron, coral, quicksilver, vermilion which here is worth a great deal; and there is much profit on the gold and silver, because it is worth more than in other parts. And there come likewise many ships from Bengal and Cholmendel, and some from Malaca for elephants, cinnamon and precious stones. In this island of Ceylan there are four or five other harbours and places of trade which are governed by other lords, nephews of the King of Ceylan, to whom they pay obedience, except that sometimes they revolt. In the middle of this island is a very lofty mountain range in which is a very high stone peak, and upon it a pool of spring water, and on this stone there is the form of a man's foot, which the Indians say is the footmark of father Adam, whom they call Adam Baba. And from all those parts and kingdoms the Moors come in pilgrimage, saying that father Adam went up from there to heaven, and they go in the habit of pilgrims, with chains of iron, and clothed with skins of leopards, lions, and other wild animals, and on their arms and legs they inflict wounds continually along the road to keep up open sores, saying that they do that for the service of God, and honour of Mahomed and Adam Baba. And some of them go well provided with money which they carry hidden to spend it on the jewels of Ceylon. Before they arrive at this mountain where Adam's footstep is, they go through swampy land, through valleys full of water, and by the banks of water, and they have five or six leagues to go with water to the waist, and all carry knives in their hands to rid themselves of the leeches which fasten on their legs, and which are innumerable. And on arriving at the mountain they make the ascent of it, and they cannot mount up to the pinnacle except by ladders of iron chains, which it has put round it, of a great thickness. And on the top of it they wash with the water of that pool, and perform their prayer: and they say that with that they remain free and pure of all sin. The said island of Ceylon is very near the mainland, and between it and the continent are some banks which have got a channel in the midst, which the Indians call Chylam, by which all the Malabar sambuks pass to Cholmendel. And every year many are lost upon these banks because the channel is very narrow: and in the year that the Admiral of Portugal went the second time to India, so many ships and sambuks of Malabar were lost in those shallows, that twelve thousand Indians were drowned there, who were coming with provisions, and were determined on driving the Portuguese fleet away from India, without allowing it to take any cargo.",

And the first place is named Quilacare, in which country there are many and great towns of Gentiles and several harbours, where dwell many Moors born in the country. They perform their voyages in small vessels which they call champana. The Malabar Moors come to these towns to trade and to bring Cambay goods, which are worth a good deal there, and a few horses. And they take in rice and cloths for Malabar. And in this province of Quilacare there is a Gentile house of prayer, in which there is an idol which they hold in great account, and every twelve years they celebrate a great feast to it, whither all the Gentiles go as to a jubilee. This temple possesses many lands and much revenue: it is a very great affair. This province has a king over it, who has not more than twelve years to reign from jubilee to jubilee. His manner of living is in this wise, that is to say: when the twelve years are completed, on the day of this feast there assemble together innumerable people, and much money is spent in giving food to Bramans. The king has a wooden scaffolding made, spread over with silken hangings: and on that day he goes to bathe at a tank with great ceremonies and sound of music, after that he comes to the idol and prays to it, and mounts on to the scaffolding, and there before all the people he takes some very sharp knives, and begins to cut off his nose, and then his ears, and his lips, and all his members, and as much flesh off himself as he can; and he throws it away very hurriedly until so much of his blood is spilled that he begins to faint, and then he cuts his throat himself. And he performs this sacrifice to the idol, and whoever desires to reign other twelve years and undertake this martyrdom for love of the idol, has to be present looking on at this: and from that place they raise him up as king.",

    "Description":"Having left Quilacare, further along the coast, at ten leagues to the north-east, is another town called Çael, which belongs to the King of Colam: it is inhabited by Gentiles and great Moorish merchants, and is a seaport where many ships touch every year from Malabar, Cholmendel, and Bengala. They deal in all kinds of goods from all parts at this place. The Chetis of this city are great lapidaries and artists for setting pearls, which fishery belongs to the King of Sahel, who has farmed it for many years forward to a very rich Moorish merchant, who is almost as important in the country as the king. And this person administers justice amongst the Moors, without the king's mixing himself up in it. Those who fish up the pearls, as has been said, fish all the week for themselves, and on the Friday for the owner of the boat; and all of them together fish at the end of the season during which they are there a whole week for this Moor. The king of Colam lives always near this city, and is very rich and powerful on account of his many men at arms, who are very good bowmen. He always has in his guard four or five hundred women, trained from girls to be archers: they are very active. He sometimes is at war with the King of Narsinga, who wishes to take his country, but he defends himself very well.",

In it there are many Gentile cities, towns and villages, and it belongs to the King of Narsinga; it is a land abounding in rice, meat and wheat, and all sorts of vegetables, because it is a country which has very beautiful plains. And many ships of Malabar come here to load rice, and they bring goods from Cambay to this country, that is to say, copper, quicksilver, vermilion, pepper and other goods. And throughout all this Cholmender much spice and drugs, and goods of Malaca, China, and Bengal are to be met with, which the Moorish ships bring here from those parts, since they do not venture to pass to Malabar from dread of the Portuguese. And although this country is very abundantly provided, yet if it should happen any year not to rain it falls into such a state of famine that many die of it, and some sell their own children for a few provisions, or for two or three fanoes, each of which will be worth thirty-six maravedis. And in these times the Malabars carry rice and cocoa nuts to them, and return with their ships laden with slaves, and all the chetis, Gentile merchants, who live throughout India, are natives of this country of Cholmender; they are very sharp, great accountants, and dexterous merchants. And many country-born Moors, mercantile and seafaring men, live in the seaports.",

    "Description":"Further along this coast, which makes a bend to the north-west and then turns to the north-east, having left the Cholmendel country, at a distance of twelve leagues there is a city almost uninhabited and very ancient, which is called Maylepur; in former times it was a considerable place of the kingdom of Narsinga. In this city is buried the body of the apostle St. Thomas, in a small church near the sea. And the Christians of Cuolam, who are of his doctrine, say that when St. Thomas left Cuolam, on being persecuted by the Gentiles, he went with a few companions to that country, and settled in this city of Maylepur, which at that period was twelve leagues distant from the sea, which later eat away the land, and came in upon it. And there he began to preach the faith of Christ, to which he converted some, whilst others persecuted and wished to kill him, and he separated himself from the people, and went about frequently among the mountains. And one day as he wandered about in that manner, a gentile hunter, with a bow, saw many peacocks together upon the ground in that mountain, and in the midst of them one very large and very handsome standing upon a stone slab; this hunter shot at it, and sent an arrow through its body, and they rose up flying, and in the air it turned into the body of a man. And this hunter stood looking until he saw the body of the said apostle fall. And he went to the city where he related that miracle to the governors, who came to see it, and they found that it was indeed the body of St. Thomas, and then they went to see the place where he had been wounded, and they saw two impressions of human feet marked on the slab, which he left impressed when he rose wounded. And when the governors of the country saw so great a miracle, they said this man was holy, and we did not believe him; and they took him and buried him in the church where he now is, and they brought the stone upon which he left the said footmarks, and they placed it close to his grave; and they say that on burying him they could never put his right arm in the tomb, and it always remained outside; and if they buried him entirely, next day they found the arm above the earth, and so they let it be. The Christians, his disciples and companions who built the said church, and the Gentiles already held him for a saint, and honoured him greatly. He remained thus with his arm outside of the grave for a long time, and they say that many people came there from many quarters in pilgrimage, and that some Chinese came also, who wished to cut off his arm and carry it away as a relic, and that when they were about to strike at it with a sword, he withdrew his arm inside, they say, and it was never seen again. So he remains still in that hermitage, very humbly, and lighted up by the grace of God, because the Moors and Gentiles light him up, each one saying that he is something belonging to them. And the house and church are ordered in our fashion, with crosses on the altar, and at the top of the vault a great wooden cross, and peacocks for a device: this church is much deteriorated. All round it there is much brushwood, and a poor Moor takes care of that building and begs alms for it, and for the lamp, which still continues burning. The Christians of India still go there as pilgrims, and carry away thence as relics some little pellets of earth of the tomb of this blessed apostle.",

This river is very great and magnificent, it is studded on both banks with opulent and noble cities of the Gentiles.

    "Description":"Having passed the river Ganges, along the coast twenty leagues to north-east by east and twelve leagues to the south-west, and then twelve leagues to the east until reaching the river Paralem, is the kingdom of Bengala, in which there are many towns, both in the interior and on the sea-coast. Those of the interior are inhabited by Gentiles, subject to the King of Bengal, who is a Moor; and the seaports are inhabited by Moors and Gentiles, amongst whom there is much trade in goods and much shipping to many parts, because this sea is a gulf which enters towards the north, and at its inner extremity there is a very great city inhabited by Moors which is called Bengala, with a very good harbour. Its inhabitants are white men and well formed. Many foreigners from various parts live in this city, both Arabs and Persians, Abyssinians and Indians, who congregate here on account of the country being very fertile and of a temperate climate. They are all great merchants, and own large ships of the same build as those of Mekkah, and others of the Chinese build which they call jungos, which are very large and carry a very considerable cargo. With these ships they navigate to Cholmender, Malabar, Cambay, Peigu, Tarnasari, Samatra, Ceylon, and Malaca; and they trade in all kinds of goods, from many places to others. There is much cotton in the country, and sugar cane plantations, and very good ginger and much long pepper. They manufacture many kinds of stuffs, extremely fine and delicate, coloured for their own use, and white for trade to all parts; they call them saravetis, and they are excellent for women's head gear, and much valued for that purpose: the Arabs and Persians make caps of this stuff, in such great quantities, that every year they fill several ships with them for different places. And they make others which they call mamuna, and others duguza, and others chautar, and others called topan and sanabafos which are the most valued for their shirts, and which are very durable. They are all of the length of twenty cubits, very little more or less, and in this city they are all at a low price. They are spun by a man with a wheel and woven. White sugar of very good quality is made in this city, but they do not know how to join it to make loaves, and so they pack it up in powder in stuff covered over with raw hide, well sewn up. They load many ships with it and export it for sale to all parts. And when these merchants were accustomed to go freely and without dread to the parts of Malabar and Cambay with their ships, the quintal of this sugar was worth two ducats and a half in Malabar, and a good sinabafo was worth two ducats, and a piece of muslin for women's caps three hundred maravedis; and a chautar of the best quality six hundred maravedis. And those who brought them gained much money. They likewise make many preserves in this city of Bengal, very good ones of ginger, and of oranges, lemons and other fruits which grow in the country. There are also in this country many horses, cows and sheep, and all other meats in great abundance, and very extremely large hens. The Moorish merchants of this city go into the interior of the country and buy many Gentile children of their fathers and mothers, or of others who steal them, and castrate them, cortandole todo de manera que quedan rasos como la palma de la mano. Some of them die of it, and those who recover they bring them up very well, and sell them as merchandise for twenty or thirty ducats each to the Persians, who value them much as guards to their wives and houses. The respectable Moors of this city go dressed in long morisco shirts reaching to the instep, white and of slight texture, and underneath some cloths wrapped round below the waist, and over the shirt a silken sash round the waist, and a dagger set with silver; they wear many jewelled rings on their fingers, and fine cotton caps on their heads. They are luxurious people, who eat and drink a great deal, and have other bad habits. They bathe frequently in large tanks which they have in their houses: they have many servants, and have each of them three or four wives, and as many more as they can maintain. They keep them very much shut up and very richly dressed and adorned with silks and jewels set in gold; they go out at night to visit one another and to drink wine, and hold festivals and marriage feasts. They make various kinds of wine in this country, chiefly of sugar and palm trees, and also of many other things. The women are very fond of these wines, and are much accustomed to them. They are great musicians both in singing and playing on instruments. The men of the common people wear short white shirts half way down the thigh, and drawers, and very small head wraps of three or four turns; all of them are shod with leather, some with shoes, others with sandals, very well worked, sewn with silk and gold thread. The king is a great lord and very rich, he possesses much country inhabited by Gentiles, of whom every day many turn Moors, to obtain the favour of the king and governors. This king possesses more territory further on the before named gulf, inhabited by Moors and Gentiles, both inland and on the sea coast, which turns to the south.",

It also borders on the kingdom of Bengal and the kingdom of Ava, and it is called Ere can guy. The king and people of this kingdom are Gentiles. It is said that this king possesses many cities and towns, and horses and elephants. These elephants are brought from the kingdom of Peigu. These people are brown men, naked from the waist upwards, and wrapped round below the waist with cotton and silk cloths; they use many ornaments of gold and silver. They venerate idols and have large houses of prayer. This king is very rich in money, and powerful from the number of his men at arms: he is often at war with his neighbours, and some of them obey him against their wills, and render him tribute. He lives in great luxury, and possesses very good houses in all the towns where he resides, which have got many pools of water, green and shady gardens, and good trees. They have also got many women at their caprice, and have no law of marriage. In twelve towns of his kingdom he has twelve first-rate palaces in which he has many women brought up; that is, in each of these cities he has a governor who each year takes twelve girls born in that year, daughters of persons of the highest rank and the prettiest to be found; and he has them carefully brought up at the expense of the king, in these palaces, up to the age of twelve years; they are very well dressed, and taught thoroughly to dance and sing and play on musical instruments; in this way each palace constantly contains many of them of tender age. And at the end of the year the governor conducts to the king at whatever place he may be at, twelve damsels of the age of twelve years. The king orders them to be well dressed and to have the name of each one written on their clothes, and the next morning he orders them to be sent up to a terrace in the sun, and there remain fasting until midday. And they perspire so much with the heat of the sun that their clothes become damp, and then the king orders them to be taken to a room where they change their clothes. And the damp garments which they have thrown off are all carried to the king, who smells them, and those which do not smell bad he keeps for himself, and those which smell bad from the perspiration he makes a present of to those of his courtiers who are there present, as also the damsels who had worn them, who are known by the names written on the clothes. The other damsels whose clothes did not smell ill from the perspiration the king keeps for himself. And thus he is always accustomed to do, and in this way they bring to him from all these twelve cities a hundred and forty-four girls, whom he distributes in the manner above described. And he has many amusements in the way of hunting, games, music, feasting and other things.",

It is called Peygu, and extends seventy-five leagues. This kingdom has three or four sea ports in which are many Moorish and Gentile inhabitants, who are very great merchants. And the actual city of Peigu is seven or eight leagues distant from the sea, on the arm of a very great river which runs through this kingdom, and comes from some very high mountains. During certain months of the year there is so great an increase of water, that the river leaves its bed and irrigates a large extent of land, from which a great deal of rice is gathered. They ship from these ports a great quantity of provisions in vessels which have three or four high masts, which they call jungos, for Malaca, Samatara, and other parts, and amongst other things much rice is shipped, and cane sugar, brown and loaf. Many Moorish ships from different parts assemble at these ports of Peigu, and bring thither much cloth of Cambay and Palacate, coloured cottons and silks, which the Indians call patola, which are worth a good deal there; they also bring opium, copper, scarlet cloth, coral in strings, in branches, and polished, quicksilver, vermilion, rose water, and a few drugs from Cambay. In this kingdom they ship very fine lac which grows there. There is much trade in cloves and mace and other Chinese goods, and musk and rubies, which come thither from inland from a city called Ava, of which mention will be made hereafter. The people of this kingdom go undressed, they only cover their middles. They are not warlike, and possess few weapons, and those wretched ones. They are very voluptuous, y traen en los capirotes de sus miembros unos cascaveles redondos cosydos soldados entre la carne y el cuero por hazerselos mayores, algunos traen tres, y algunos cinco, y algunos syete, y dellos de oro y de plata, y otros de metal, los quales les van sonando de que andan y an lo por mucha gentileza y las mugeres huelgan mucho con ellos y no quieren hombres que no los tengan, y los que mas honrados son, esos los traen mas y mayores. (_The Lisbon edition continues_: e nom diga mais deste costume pola desonestidade.) The king is called the King of the White Elephant, and in this kingdom there are very high mountains where many wild elephants are bred; and they have a rule to catch one every day, and the king orders food to be sent them and has them brought up. He has a great quantity of them which he sells to merchants who come there to buy them, to take them to Pelecate, whence they go on to Narsynga, Malabar and Cambaya. There are likewise many small horses which go at an amble, which they make great use of; they also have horses on which they ride à la bastarda, and with these and the elephants, and infantry, they carry on war. There are also many sheep and swine, wild and domestic in this kingdom, and the people are great sportsmen and hunters.",

Many ships touch at it, and trade there and stow provisions and other goods, especially lac of a very good quality, which grows in the country itself; and the Moors of Persia and India call it lucomartaban. And it also grows in the country of Narsinga, but not so good as this: they say of this lac that it is gum of trees, others say that it grows on the slender branches of the trees, just as in our parts the berries grow. And this explanation appears the most natural. And so they bring it in small sticks, which naturally cannot produce so much gum. In this town of Martaban very large and beautiful porcelain vases are made, and some of glazed earthenware, of a black colour, which are highly valued amongst the Moors, and they export them as merchandise, and they also carry away from this country much benjuy in large loaves.",

In this city there are many Moorish and Gentile merchants, who deal in all sorts of goods, and own ships, with which they navigate to Bengal, Malaca, and other parts. In the inland parts of this kingdom there grows much good benjuy, which is a resin of trees which the Moors call luban javi, and it is of two kinds, that is to say, one which does not smell except in the fire, and the other of much scent, of which the good and genuine storax is made in the Levant, before extracting from it the oil, which in the Levant is extracted from it. And many ships of Moors and from other parts congregate at this port of Tanasary, and bring them copper, quicksilver, vermilion, scarlet cloth, silks, coloured velvets from Mekkah, saffron, coral, wrought and in strings, rose-water from Mekkah in little bottles of tinned copper, and it is sold by weight with the bottle; opium, Cambay stuffs, and all these goods fetch a high price at this place.",

    "Description":"Having left this town of Tanasery further along the coast towards Malaca there is another seaport of the kingdom of Ansiam, which is called Queda, in which also there is much shipping, and great interchange of merchandise. And many ships of the Moors and from other parts come there. Very good pepper grows in the country, which they carry to Malaca, and thence to China. This King of Ansiam has three other sea ports between Malaca and Tenasery, of which I do not know the names, and he possesses many cities, towns, and other villages. Throughout the country in the interior the people are Gentiles, and Moors do not enter there, and if at any time any Moor goes there to trade with them, they do not permit him to carry arms. There is much gold in this kingdom which is collected in the country, particularly in the lordship of Pani, which is beyond Malacca towards China, and has always belonged to the kingdom of Siam, until now that it has risen up against it, and does not obey it, but has rather placed itself in subjection to the King of Malacca. And so likewise in this kingdom of Siam, there is another lordship and country of Gentiles, in subjection to it, which is called Sara hangor, in which there is much tin, which they carry to the city of Malacca as merchandise, and hence they carry it to all parts. The king and people of the kingdom of Ansyam, who are Gentiles, greatly honour their idols, and have many customs different from those of the other nations. They go naked from the waist upwards, and some wear small jackets of silk stuffs. The country is very well supplied with provisions, flesh of domestic and wild animals, and rice. They have many horses of a small breed, and much fruit of various qualities. The men are great hunters and sportsmen. In the interior of the country towards China, there is another kingdom of Gentiles which is in obedience to him, (the King of Siam) and there, when a relation or a friend dies, they eat him roasted before a great fire in the middle of a field, where they set up three poles stuck in the earth, and between them a chain with two hooks of iron, and they bring the body of the man who has died of illness or of any other death, and they hang him up there by the hams, roasting him, and his children and relations are there bewailing him, and after he is well roasted they take wine in cups, and they have knives with which they all cut from the body and eat of it, weeping all the while, and they drink their wine; and the nearest relations begin first to eat, and in this manner they finish eating him, and leave only the bones, which they burn afterwards; and they say that they give such a burial to their relations on account of their being of their own flesh, and that they cannot be any where better buried than in their bodies. And in all the kingdom of Ansyam they burn the dead bodies, because that is the custom of all the Gentile countries.",

    "Description":"The said kingdom of Ansyane throws out a great point of land into the sea, which makes there a cape, where the sea returns again towards China to the north; in this promontory is a small kingdom in which there is a large city called Malaca; and in former times it belonged to the kingdom of Ansyam. And the Moors of the town and foreign Moors, established their trade in this city, in which they increased so much in wealth, that they revolted with the country and caused the neighbouring inhabitants to turn Moors, and they set up a Moorish king over them, without paying further obedience to the said King of Ansyam. Many Moorish merchants reside in it, and also Gentiles, particularly Chetis, who are natives of Cholmendel: and they are all very rich and have many large ships, which they call jungos. They deal in all sorts of goods in different parts, and many other Moorish and Gentile merchants flock thither from other countries to trade; some in ships of two masts from China and other places, and they bring thither much silk in skeins, many porcelain vases, damasks, brocades, satins of many colours, they deal in musk, rhubarb, coloured silks, much iron, saltpetre, fine silver, many pearls and seed pearl, chests, painted fans, and other toys, pepper, wormwood, Cambay stuffs, scarlet cloths, saffron, coral polished and rough, many stuffs of Palecate, of coloured cotton, others white from Bengal, vermilion, quicksilver, opium and other merchandise, and drugs from Cambay; amongst which there is a drug which we do not possess and which they call puchô, and another called cachô, and another called magican, which are gall nuts, which they bring from the Levant to Cambay, by way of Mekkah, and they are worth a great deal in China and Java. There also come thither many ships from Java, which have four masts, very different from ours, and of very thick wood. When these become old they fish them with other new planks, and in this manner they carry three or four coverings of planking one above the other; and the sails are of woven osiers, and the cordage of the same. These bring much rice, meat of cows, sheep, pigs and deer, dried and salted, many chickens, garlic and onions. They also bring thither many weapons for sale, that is to say, lances, daggers and swords, worked with inlaid metal and of very good steel, they bring likewise cubebs and a yellow die which they call cazunba, and gold which is produced in Java. They bring their wives and children in these ships, and there are some mariners whose wives and children never leave the ship to go on shore, nor have any other dwelling, but there are born and die. From this place many ships sail to the Molucca Islands, which will be mentioned further on, to ship cloves, and they carry there as merchandise Cambay cloths, and all sorts of cottons, silks, and other stuffs of Palacate and Bangala, quicksilver, tin, copper unwrought and wrought into bells, and in a coin which they bring from China, like ceutis of Portugal, pierced in the middle, pepper, porcelain, garlic and onions, with other things and drugs from Cambay; and they traffic much in them. So they navigate in these ships to other islands which are scattered over all the sea, that is to say, to Timor, whence they bring white sandal, which the Indians make great use of; and they carry to them iron, hatchets, knives, swords, cloths of Palacate and Cambay, copper, quicksilver, vermilion, tin and lead, little beads from Cambay of all sorts. And in exchange for these things they carry away the before named sandal, honey, wax, slaves; and at the Isles of Bandam they ship nutmeg and mace. These islands supply themselves with goods from Cambay. These ships also fetch pepper from Samatra, silk in skeins, benjuy, and fine gold; and from other islands they fetch camphor and aloes wood; and they also navigate to Tanasery, Peygu, Bengala, Palecate, Cholmender, Malabar, Cambay, and Aden, with all kinds of goods, so that this city of Malaca is the richest trading port and possesses the most valuable merchandise, and most numerous shipping and extensive traffic, that is known in all the world. And it has got such a quantity of gold that the great merchants do not estimate their property, nor reckon otherwise than by bahars of gold, which are four quintals each bahar. There are merchants among them who will take up singly three or four ships laden with very valuable goods, and will supply them with cargo from their own property. They are very well made men, and likewise the women, they are of a brown colour, and go bare from the waist upwards, and from that downwards cover themselves with silk and cotton cloths, and they wear short jackets half way down the thigh of scarlet cloth, and silk, cotton or brocade stuffs; and they are girt with belts, and carry daggers in their waists wrought with rich inlaid work, these they call querix. And the women dress in wraps of silk stuffs, and short shirts much adorned with gold and jewellery, and have long beautiful hair. These people have many mosques, and when they die they bury their bodies. Their children inherit from them. They live in large houses, and have their gardens and orchards, and pools of water outside the city for their recreation. They have got many slaves who are married with wives and children. These slaves live separately and serve them when they have need of them. These Moors who are named Malayos are very polished people, and gentlemen, musical, gallant, and well proportioned. The Chety merchants from Cholmendel are for the most part stout and corpulent. They also go bare from the waist upwards. In this city there are also many people from Java dwelling in it; they are small stout men, whose breasts and faces are long and ill formed. They are Moors and go bare from the waist upwards, and wear cloths ill put on from the waist downwards. They wear nothing on their heads, and their hair is curled with art, and some of them are shaved. They are ingenious and subtle in all their work, and very cunning and treacherous, and of little truth, daring in all mischief, and unto death. They have very good arms and fight valiantly. There are some of them who if they fall ill of any severe illness, vow to God that if they remain in health they will of their own accord seek another more honourable death for his service, and as soon as they get well they take a dagger in their hands and go out into the streets and kill as many persons as they meet, both men, women and children, in such wise that they go like mad dogs, killing until they are killed. These are called amuco. And as soon as they see them begin this work, they cry out saying, amuco, amuco, in order that people may take care of themselves, and they kill them with dagger and spear thrusts. Many of these Javans live in this city with wives and children and property. This city possesses very good water and fruit, and is very healthy. Other provisions are brought from outside. The King of Malaca has got much treasure, and a large revenue from the duties which he collects. To him the lord of Pam made himself tributary, who was a ruler in the kingdom of Ansyam, and he raised himself up against it. In this country of Pam much gold of inferior quality is found. This country of Malaca was discovered by Diego Lopez de Sequeyra, a Portuguese gentleman, and after it was discovered the Moors of the country took certain Portuguese and merchandise by stratagem, and killed some, on account of which Alfonso de Alborquerque, Captain General of the King of Portugal in the Indies, moved his fleet, and went against Malaca to avenge this event, and he attacked and took it by assault, and drove out the King of Malaca, notwithstanding that the Moors made a vigorous defence with artillery, spears, arms, guns, and arrows, and with elephants armed with wooden castles, in which were good soldiers with their weapons. So that the merchants and traders of this city surrendered into subjection to the King of Portugal, without any vexations being done to them. And the Portuguese immediately built a handsome fortress in this city, which entirely commands the town and all its trade, as it was before. Much spoil was taken in this city, and great wealth from those who had fled. The ruler of Pam, the lord of a gold mine, on knowing that Malaca was in subjection to the King of Portugal, at once sent an ambassador to this Captain Major General, offering obedience to the King of Portugal.",

The Moors live in the seaports, and the Gentiles in the interior of the country. The principal kingdom of the Moors is called Pedir. Much very good pepper grows in it, which is not so strong or so fine as that of Malabar. Much silk is also grown there, but not so good as the silk of China. Another kingdom is called Birahem, and another Paser, and another Campar, another Andraguide, another Manancabo, where much fine gold is collected, which is taken thence to Malaca, most of it in dust; and another kingdom called Haru, of Gentiles, who eat human flesh, and any person whom they can catch, they eat him without any mercy. And it also contains many other kingdoms of Gentiles in the interior of the country. In some parts of this island there grows much benjuy, pepper, and long pepper, camphor, and some ginger, and wax. Many ships sail to this island for these goods. Cloths and goods from Cambay are worth a good deal in it, and so also coral, quicksilver, rose-water, dried fish from Maldiu. These Moors are very disloyal, and often kill their kings and set up others who are more powerful. The King of Portugal has a fortress in this island, and trade. And having passed Samatara towards Java there is the island of Sunda, in which there is much good pepper, and it has a king over it, who, they say, desires to serve the King of Portugal. They ship thence many slaves for China.",

And in its seaports there are many towns and villages and large settlements of Moors, with Moorish kings. But they are all obedient to the king of the island, who is a Gentile, and lives in the interior of the country, and is a great lord called Patevdara, and sometimes some rebel against him, and afterwards he again subjugates them. Some of these Moorish rulers and inhabitants of Java desire to serve the King of Portugal, and others are ill affected towards him. They say that this island is the most abundant country in the world. There is in it much good rice, and various meats of all kinds, domestic and wild, they make in this place much dried and salted flesh for many parts. There grows in this island pepper, cinnamon, ginger, bamboos, cubebs, and gold. Its inhabitants are short and stout in stature with broad faces. Most of them go bare from the waist upwards, others wear silk clothes down to the middle of the thigh, and their beards thin; the hair shaven on the top and curled upwards, they wear nothing on their heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads, nor anything whatever, and if any person ware to put his hand upon their head they would kill him: and they do not build houses with stories, in order that they may not walk over each other's heads. They are very proud men, liars and treacherous; very ingenious as carpenters and masons, and very good artillerymen. They make in this country many guns and long muskets, and many other fireworks. And in all other parts they are much esteemed for this and as artillerymen. They have got many ships and great navigation, and many rowing galleys. They are great corsairs and mariners, and they make many kinds of arms of good temper and of good steel, wrought with very pretty inlaid work of gold and ivory: they are great sorcerers and necromancers, and they make arms in certain places and hours, and they say that those cannot die by steel who wear them, and that they kill by drawing blood: and others of which they say that those who bear them cannot be conquered. And they say that there are arms which they employ eight or ten years to complete, watching for places, hours and minutes, disposed for these effects: and the kings prize and take great care of these. They are great sportsmen and hunters, they have plenty of horses and many good hunting dogs, and birds of prey for the chase. When they go to hunt they take their wives with them in handsome carts with canopies and curtains; and the kings and great lords also go in those carts, which are drawn by horses when they go hunting. The ladies are white and very pretty in figure and of pleasing countenances though rather long; they sing well, are polished in manner, and are very industrious workwomen.",

    "Description":"Beyond these islands twenty-five leagues towards the north-east there are five islands one before the other, which are called the islands of Maluco, in which all the cloves grow, and they are of Gentiles and Moors. Their kings are Moors, and the first of them is called Bachan, the second Maquian, which contains a very good harbour, the third is called Motil, the fourth Tidory, and the fifth Ternaty, in which there is a Moorish king who is called Sultan Benarra Sorala. He was king of all these islands of cloves, and now all the four have revolted, and have each got a king of their own. The hills in these five islands are all of cloves, which grow on trees like laurel, which has its leaf like that of the arbutus, and it grows like the orange flower, which in the beginning is green and then turns white, and when it is ripe it turns coloured, and then they gather it by hand, the people going amongst the trees, and they put it to dry in the sun, where it turns brown, and if there is no sun they dry it with the smoke, and after it is very dry they sprinkle it with salt water for it not to crumble, and that it may preserve its virtue. And there are such quantities of these cloves that they never can finish gathering them, so that they let much of it be lost. And the trees from which they do not gather it for three years, after that become wild, so that their cloves are worth nothing. Every year the people of Malaca and Java come to these islands to ship cloves, and they bring as merchandise, quicksilver, vermilion, stuffs from Cambay, Bengal and Palecate, drugs from Cambay, some pepper, porcelain, large metal bells which are made in Java, dishes of copper and tin. The cloves are worth very little in these islands, so as to be almost for nothing. This King of Maluco is a Moor, and almost a Gentile; he has a Moorish wife, and three or four hundred Gentile damsels whom he keeps in his house, and he has of many of them Gentile sons and daughters, and only the children of the Moorish women become Moors. He is served by humpbacked women, whom he orders to have their spines bent from childhood, for state and show; and he may have eighty or a hundred of these, who always go with him and serve him as pages; some give him betel, others carry his sword, and they render all other services. In these islands there are many coloured parrots, of very splendid colours; they are tame, and the Moors call them nure, and they are much valued amongst them.",

They bring some ill made boats to ship cloves in the before mentioned islands, and copper, tin and Cambay stuffs. They bring for sale very long and broad swords of one edge and other manufactures of iron, and much gold. These people eat human flesh, and if the King of Maluco has any person to execute they beg for him to eat him, just as one would ask for a pig, and the islands from whence they come are called Celebe.",

    "Description":"Leaving these islands which are many, almost unnumbered, of all of which the names are not known; and they are towards the north and in the direction of China, and there is not much information about them; it is only known that after passing the kingdom of Ansyam and other kingdoms, there is the kingdom of China, which they say is a very extensive dominion, both along the coast of the sea and in the interior of the country; it is a country of Gentiles, and it possesses many islands in the sea also inhabited by Gentiles, subject to it, in which the King of China keeps his governors and officers of his appointment. This king always resides in the interior of the country in very large and good cities. No foreigner enters within the kingdom, they can only trade in the sea ports, and in the islands; and if any ambassador from another kingdom comes to it by sea, he first gives information of it in order that he may enter, and afterwards the king bids him be conducted to where he is staying. The inhabitants of the country are white men, tall, well-made and gentlemen; and so likewise the women. They have got only one defect, that their eyes are very small, and on their chins they have three or four hairs and no more; the smaller their eyes are, so much the prettier they think them; and the same as regards the women. They are very smartly dressed, clothed in silk and cotton and woollen stuffs, and their costumes are like those of Germans; they are shod with soft leather boots and shoes, like the people of a cold country. They have a language of their own, and the tone of it is like that of Germans. They eat on high tables like ourselves, with their napkins, and for as many as may be there to eat, they set before each one a plate, a small roll, and a knife, and a silver cup; they do not touch the food which they are going to eat with their hands, but eat it with little pinchers of silver or wood, and they hold in their left hand the dish or porcelain in which they eat, brought very close to the mouth, and with those pinchers they eat very quickly. They prepare various kinds of viands, and eat all meats, and wheaten bread. They drink several kinds of wine, and many times during their meals. They also eat the flesh of dogs which they hold to be good meat. They are men of truth and good gentlemen: they are great merchants of all sorts of goods. They make much porcelain in the country, and very good, which is a great article of commerce for all parts. They make them of sea snail shells well ground and with the whites and shells of eggs, and of other materials, of which they make a dough, which they put under the earth to ripen and mature itself, for a space of eighty or a hundred years, and they leave this mass as a treasure and inheritance, because as the time approaches for working it so it becomes more valuable, and in this way they leave it to their sons and grandsons; and after the time has arrived they work it into vases of all patterns, and after they are made they enamel and paint them. There also grows and is produced in this country of China much very good silk, of which they make a great quantity of stuffs; that is to say, damasks of all colours, satins of several kinds, and brocade. There is much rhubarb in this country, and much musk, very fine silver, seed pearl, and pearls that are not very round. They also make many other very pretty gilded things in this country; that is to say, very rich chests and trays of gilt wood, salt dishes, fans, and other delicate works of ingenious men. They are also great navigators in very large ships which they call jungos, of two masts, of a different make from ours, the sails are of matting, and so also the cordage. There are great corsairs and robbers amongst those islands and ports of China. They go with all these goods to Malaca, where they also carry much iron, saltpetre and many other things, and for the return voyage they ship there Samatra and Malabar pepper, of which they use a great deal in China, and drugs of Cambay, much anfiam, which we call opium, wormwood, Levant gall nuts, saffron, coral wrought and unwrought, stuffs from Cambay, Palecate and Bengal, vermilion, quicksilver, scarlet cloth, and many other things. In this country of China the pepper is worth fifteen ducats the quintal, and more according to the quantity they carry there, which pepper they buy in Malaca at four ducats the quintal. Many of these Chinese take their wives and children continually in the ships in which they live without possessing any other dwelling. This China borders on Tartary towards the north, and it is a thousand leagues distant to the north-north-west from the Malucos.",

    "Description":"On the 18th Dec., at two o'clock, the pilot laid the vessel alongside the wharf, when, in an instant its deck was covered with people of all sorts, looking about and asking questions. After packing my luggage, I went into the town to procure something to eat, lodgings, &c., when I felt myself a stranger, on a foreign, although a kindred strand. After dining heartily on some excellent sausages, with some pleasant mild ale, I took a ramble through the city; but I hardly knew how to walk, the pavement seemed to have the motion of the vessel. Baltimore is a large town, with some handsome public and private buildings; the streets are spacious, airy, and clean; the centres pitched with rock stone, and the side walks paved with red brick, of which also houses are mostly built. Pratt Street, along the water side, was all in a bustle, and apparently full of business, but the method of doing it evidently differs considerably from the manner in England. At one church, and two meeting-houses (no chapels here); some of them elegant buildings, with very respectable-looking congregations. Dined with the captain, whose treatment was hospitable. The manners of the Americans appear widely different to the English, particularly of the females, who are more easy and unembarrassed, yet reserved, in their address, than the retiring diffidence of the latter. Took lodgings at a respectable ship carpenter's, at three dollars, or 13 s. 6 d. sterling, per week, board, washing, and mending including. —A clear, bright, frosty air this morning. Thermometer in my sleeping room 43. Went to the custom-house, with the captain, to clear my luggage. Paid half a dollar to a notary (a very polite, agreeable person) for drawing up an inventory and certificate of my luggage, and 20 cents (one-fifth of a dollar, or about 11 d. sterling) on presenting it, when the only question asked was, Will you swear this is a correct statement, and that the articles are for your own private use? I merely answered in the affirmative. Had a ramble through the town and its environs. Like the appearance of the Americans generally, and think the place prosperous, as tho people appear to be all employed and busy, and have the air of ease and content in their countenances, with but little superciliousness. The markets are well supplied with meat as to quantity, but the quality not quite, so good as in England, excepting the pork, which is fine; some little good beef, but veal and mutton very indifferent, nor is trouble taken to set it off to the best advantage. The vegetables brought to market now are chiefly potatoes, beets, and cabbages, great quantities of the latter, and mostly drumheads; some few carrots, turnips, onions, sweet potatoes, &c. at moderate prices. A great many negroes about the markets and wharfs, who appear far more lively and as independent as the whites, but are treated by the latter as inferior beings; will not eat at the same table, or walk in their company, and have separate places of worship. There are five market houses in Baltimore, some of them large, and all conveniently built, very similar to the old Fleet Market in London. The centres, which are spacious, are occupied on each side by the butchers; on the outside of the butchers' stalls is also a passage on each side, with stalls on either hand, where vegetables, country produce, flour, meal, &c., ready-made clothes, shoes, tin-ware, &c. are exposed. The fish markets are at the ends of the others, and generally well supplied. To-day are their Christmas markets, at which there is great plenty of every thing—some good beef, pork excellent, mutton thin and small, veal (calf) hardly fit to eat, killed too young.",

    "Description":"Arrive in Philadelphia, a place the more interesting for the generous and noble character of its worthy founder; one may easily discern the sound judgment of PENN, in his choice of a site for building the city. Far enough up the river to be out of danger of surprise from an enemy's fleet; on ground sufficiently high and dry for health, with an easy slope to the water for convenience of trade, &c., and the country round rich and fertile. There are several English families leaving hereabouts, I am informed, for the province of Upper Canada, to procure land of government. Took a walk into the country; the soil in the vicinity of the town is a strong sandy loam; saw some excellent crops of wheat, barley, and rye, partly lodged or laired. Wheat will be twelve or fourteen days before ripe, and rye eight or ten. People busy with their hay and clover, which are pretty good crops, but they have stood till they are too old before cutting, which appears to be a too general practice where I have been; but the heat of the climate, and, consequently, quick growth and ripening of the grass, necessarily prevent the whole being cut down in proper order. Engaged board and lodging at the New England Hotel at 2 s. 3 d. per day. Nothing particularly striking in the town; no elegant public springs or monuments, &c., that I could see, as at Baltimore: streets not so spacious, but more regular and compact than the latter. The country too flat for shew, the finest object being the river and its opposite shore, about half a mile across, with a little island in the middle of it. Steam and team boats continually crossing and re-crossing. They are double boats, or two placed side by side, the paddles working between, with a deck across both, to take waggons, carriages, &c. You may drive into them seated in any vehicle, and out on the opposite side on coming to shore, without the least danger. A large bell is rang every time they make the shore, stop about ten minutes, ring again and off.",

North or Hudson River runs on one side, and East River on the other, at the end of which they join. A very great number of vessels, of all kinds and sizes, lying at the wharfs on both sides of the town, and a great deal of business going forward, more like London than any other place I have seen. Broadway is a fine street, as are also some others. Markets are well supplied, but appear to be much crowded. At the back of the town there are evident marks of an overwhelming flood. On the highest parts of the island the soil is washed off the rocks, and huge stones laid bare, or tumbled together in the ravines. Another such a place near Trenton, on high land. Almost all the roads leading to a town in America are full of houses on their sides, called “taverns,” or “liquor,” “beer and cake,” or “grocery” stores. My notice was attracted to-day by one with a small kitchen garden before it, with a few benches for seats, with Waterloo Gardens in printed capitals over the gate! as a magnet, I suppose, to attract the contents of Johnny Bull's purse. New York is a place of great trade, and will still increase, it is so well situated. Open at all times to the sea—at the confluence of several fine rivers, and the canal from Albany to Lake Erie greatly augments it. The state of New York is the richest in the Union, and the climate the most genial and moderate for Europeans. The prices of wheat, flour, &c. here, at Baltimore and Philadelphia, are nearly the same. As building in summer is always going on, house-carpenters, brick-makers, and bricklayers, generally find employment almost anywhere, except in the depth of winter, at 4 s. 6 d. to 7 s. or 8 s. per day; also shoemakers, tailors, and persons well acquainted with any useful common trade, may meet with employ in some place or other.",

This ridge or mountain runs north-west towards Lake Huron circuitously, and south-east across the Niagara at Queenston, before noticed, and onward through Lockfort, in the States. Ancaster is a large thriving handsome village, with some smart buildings, good houses, and a neat new church situated on the brow of the hill, down which a small but constant spring-stream runs, supplying two distilleries, a brewhouse, and a large mill, &c. This place, I am told, mostly belongs to one of four brothers, Scotchmen, of the name of Crooks, who have all been members of the colonial assembly. Passed on along a meandering road over hill and through dale, to Dundas, a pretty little, yet fast increasing, village, situated in a vale, by the side of a clear stream, two miles from Ancaster.",

The government offices are large, and built of brick. The houses and other buildings, although generally small, are neat, and better furnished than what I have seen in some other places. The country round the town is rather too flat for show. No distant object strikes the eye except the lighthouse, the shores of the lake, and the peninsula on the opposite side of the bay, which are pleasing. The town has been unhealthy till of late; a swamp at the back of it was the cause. It is now drained, and the place is healthy. There are two churches, one of the establishment and the other Roman Catholic, and two or three meeting houses. In Canada, as in the States, the Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists, appear the most numerous, except in particular places, (but I may be incorrect, as I have no data to guide me), yet the Episcopalians, or Church of England Congregationalists, (Independents), and Roman Catholics, are pretty numerous; besides others, such as Quakers, Dunkards, (who are Germans) Universalists, Unitarians, and some new sects, “Davidites,” and Christians, &c. &c. On my leaving the Province a grand Law-Hall was building, and a new House of Assembly and College to be commenced immediately, which makes a demand for stone cutters and masons, and is a great stimulus to the place; there is also a talk of a new Episcopal church being shortly erected.",

Land from 30 s. to 4 l. 10 s. per acre. Fruit is plentiful, good, and cheap. Apples are pared, quartered, and cored, then strung on a thread to dry, either by the sun or fire.

As you approach the town by Long Island it looks very fine. Point Frederic in front, on which is situated the navy yard, barracks, offices, and houses of the government officers and others, has a very similar appearance, in miniature, to New York and vicinity-Kingston is an old settled place, situated on the west bank of the Catarauqnui river, opposite the naval depôt, over which a large bridge is about to be built of wood. Wooden bridges in this country, generally, are the most proper at present, being more economical, requiring less outlay from the scanty finances of a new country; yet, as there is here such immense rocks, and good building and lime stone, on the spot, (laid bare by an overflowing of the water over the surrounding neighbourhood at some early period), I should have supposed it would have been nearly as cheap, and if so, certainly more desirable for its durability and strength. The harbour is good, and an excellent place for wharfs; but, with the exception of two or three, you run the risk of a broken limb in crossing them. The houses are built chiefly of stone, and generally larger than those in York; the streets are also paved with stones, (in rather a rough manner), which gives it much the appearance of a small-sized market town in England, about 3000 inhabitants. There are a number of good stores; and three or four large druggists' shops, as elegantly arranged as some in London, in all their neatness of order, much better than the general part I have seen in America. A pretty large and handsome stonebuilt church, and another small one belonging to the Establishment, besides Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Methodist places of worship. I like the appearance of Kingston generally, but it is not so thriving as York; and here also there is a little of the American feature before noticed. Houses and premises half built and half in ruins, unmeaning, slovenly arrangements, &c.; but they are fully counter-balanced by a number of specimens of real neatness and order, in different parts of the town, and particularly along the banks of the bay. The military establishment in the neighbourhood causes some little business, yet the inhabitants complain times are not now as they have been. A band of music from the barracks parades the town occasionally at night, playing lively airs. Four steam-boats ply between here and Prescott and up the bay of Quintie (pronounced Kanty, or Canty), besides three to Niagara, York, and Queenston, once a week. Three very large ships of war on the stocks, one above 100 guns, where they have remained since the war. Kingston is inhabited chiefly by Europeans, the greater part Irish, I believe, considerable numbers of Scotch, some Americans, and a few English. With a little of the downright hearty good-feeling of my countrymen, I also witnessed some of the haughty superciliousness of aristocratic pride, and the impudence of pampered menials. The market is well supplied with meat, fruit, and vegetables.",

Merchants from the upper province come here once a year for a supply of merchandise for the coming year, and take the money for the last year's produce sent down. A considerable number of them are in the town at the present time. Some of the streets are too narrow, particularly St. Paul's Street, in which a great deal of the wholesale business is done; the footways only three or four feet wide. Some of the streets are tolerably well paved, others roughly; and M'Adamising going forward in some of them. Houses are mostly of stone, neat, strong, and capacious; and if it were not for their high sharp tinned roofs, would have much the appearance of a large town in England. No private warehouses; goods are landed on a high made bank, and in some places on the beach of the river, and then hauled up to the warehouses. The immense accumulation of ice in the winter, has carried away some warehouses that had been built. Several vessels from Europe, and steam-boats, are continually coming and going to various parts up and down the river, and such is the opposition by the two companies that run them between Montreal and Quebec, that each has one boat that carries passengers between the two places, 180 miles, in the cabin, and board, for 7 s. 6 d. , and the deck passengers for 6 d. each only! The most remarkable attraction in the place is the new Roman Catholic Church, the largest in America, and not surpassed in size by a great many in Europe, covering, it is said, an acre of land, and accommodating 12,000 people.

    "Description":"Left Montreal, for Quebec, at eight o'clock at night, in the John Molson steamer, and arrived at three o'clock the following day; distance, 180 miles; paid 18s. for a cabin birth. The river St. Lawrence is truly called noble, and the scenery in many places along its banks is grand. Passed some smart villages and towns; and the roads are thickly studded with long-roofed, neat white houses; and the, churches, with their tin-covered roofs and aspiring pinnacles glistening in the sun, have an enlivening appearance. It is a pity the river has so many obstructions to navigation at its upper part; as, otherwise, it would be the most commercial stream in the world. There is only one slight rapid between Montreal and Quebec (the Richelieu), or indeed the Ocean, nearly 1000 miles, and that is only difficult for large rafts in adverse winds, its course being narrow, but deep. The tide running a little above it, there is no rapid at high water. Anticosta is a very large island, dangerous to navigation, lying across the gulf. Vessels of any size are now invariably towed up by steamers from Quebec to Montreal. For the timber trade, Quebec is of great and growing importance. This season, nearly 800 vessels have already arrived, and numbers are daily arriving,—too many, indeed, as the lowness of the water in the rivers this spring has prevented a great portion of the best timber being brought to market. The consequence is a rise in price of from 50 to 100 per cent. The best of—the timber growing near the shores of the St. Lawrence and lower part of Lake Ontario, has been brought to market; and when the Upper Canada canals are opened, there will be a fine field for the industrious lumberer , in the immense forests of superior timber, growing on the shores of lakes Erie and Huron, and even Lake Superior, and their tributary streams, which are inexhaustible for centuries to come. The time is not far distant when vessels will be built on the Upper Lakes, 1500 miles from the sea, and freighted thence for Europe and the West Indies. Indeed, one is already built for that purpose, and is now plying on Lake Erie, waiting the completion of the canals. On approaching Quebec, the river for miles was lined along its sides with ships loading lumber. Quebec is situated on a point of land (Cape Diamond), on the north-west side of the river, and opposite to Point Lewis; nine miles above the falls of Montmorency, and five or six above the island of Orleans. The old town is a narrow, inconvenient, and dirty place: it is situated under the immense rocks of hard black stone, which rise almost perpendicularly in some places, several hundred feet, nearly all round the Cape; its length is, extending upwards to Wolfe's Cove (the place where General Wolfe landed on taking Quebec) two miles, and downward to St. Roche, at the month of the St. Charles's River, two miles. Near the latter there are many new wharfs built, some ship-yards, steam, and saw mills, &c. The river St. Charles is a fine stream, running through an extensive vale of good land, open, cleared, and pretty well cultivated, partly by Scotch and Irish. Viewing this vale from the heights of Abraham, in fine weather, awakens recollections of a former view of one of the beautiful champaign vales of England.—The Upper Town is much better built, having wider streets, and is altogether more handsome: it is founded upon the above-mentioned rock, overlooking the Lower Town, the shipping, the country north of the Isle of Orleans, and Point Levi, across the river. The Upper Town is walled in, and is amazingly strong both by nature and art, particularly the citadel, on the highest and outermost point of Cape Diamond, and is still improving. Strangers are not allowed ingress to it, without a ticket. It is a second Gibraltar, and the key of the Canadas. There is a good garrison stationed here, who enliven the place daily with two or three bands of music.",

And, if I remember right, the only buildings which show their lofty heads above the rest, are the State House, Christ Church (both built prior to the Revolution), a Presbyterian meeting-house, and shot-tower. The city, therefore, when viewed from the water, and at a distance, presents any thing but a picturesque appearance. It is somewhat singular, too, that there should be such a scarcity of spires and conspicuous buildings, there being no fewer than ninety places of worship, besides hospitals and charitable institutions in great numbers. In place, too, of noble piers and quays of solid masonry, which we might reasonably expect to find in a city containing near 140,000 inhabitants, and holding the second rank in commercial importance in North America, there are but some shabby wharfs, and piers of rough piles of timber, jutting out in unequal lengths and shapes, from one end to the other of the river front; and these again are backed by large piles of wood, warehouses, and meanlooking stores... Fifty paces hence, the stranger enters the city, which possesses an interior almost unrivalled in the world. On walking through the fine broad streets, with rows of locust or other trees, which planted on the edge of the causeway, from a most delightful shade, and take away the glare of the brick buildings, he is struck immediately with the air of simplicity, yet strength and durability which all the public edifices possess, while the private dwellings with their neat white marble steps and window-sills bespeak wealth and respectability. The neatness, too, of the dress of every individual, with the total absence of those lazy and dirty vagabonds who ever infest our towns, and loiter about the corners of all the public streets, passing insolent remarks upon every well-dressed man, or even unattended female, impress a foreigner with a most pleasing and favourable idea of an American city. The river in front of the town is about a mile wide, but the channel is considerably contracted by an island which extends nearly the full length of the town, and consequently renders the navigation more intricate. It is prettily planted with trees, and a ship has been run ashore at one end, and converted into a tavern, a house being raised upon the upper deck. It was quite a gala day, numerous steam-vessels and rowing boats, proceeding up the stream to Kensington (part of the suburbs,) and we arrived just in time to see a large ship of 600 tons burthen glide gracefully from the stocks.",

    "Description":"A few hundred paces from the hotel, up the Pennsylvania Avenue, I crossed a small muddy creek, classically denominated the Tiber, and, soon after gained the large iron gates at the entrance of the area within which the Capitol is situated. It is upon a lofty eminence, overlooking the plain upon which the city is built; and several broad flights of steps lead to the principal entrance. The first stone was laid by Washington, during his administration, in September, 1793; but it was not finished to its present state until some time after the conclusion of hostilities in 1815, previously to which the wings only were built of substantial materials, the intermediate space between them, now occupied by the Rotunda, being formed of wood. It was consumed in the conflagration of the public buildings which ensued on the entrance of the British into the city, on the evening of the 24th of August, 1814. It is situated nearly in the centre of the area, which contains 22½ acres of ground, and is surrounded by a low wall and strong iron balustrade, a small shrubbery of low trees being planted within the railing. The western front, towards the city, is tastefully laid out in grass terraces and gravel walks; while on the eastern a garden has been fenced off within an iron railing, to which however every one has free access. The eastern front of the building stands upon higher ground than the western; and, to remedy this defect in the appearance, an earthen terrace was formed at some distance (probably 20 feet) from the basement story on the latter side, which, in addition to answering the primary object, affords, by being underbuilt, excellent cellars for fuel. The entrance, then, is from this terrace into the Rotunda, which is on the second story, and paved with stone, receiving light from the dome, 96 feet above the floor. Its diameter is also the same; and the echo of footsteps along the pavement, or the voices of people conversing, almost equals that in the whispering gallery of St. Paul's. The western side of it is ornamented with four large oil-paintings, by Colonel Trumbull, an officer of the American army, and aid-de-camp to Washington during the revolutionary war.",

    "Description":"Having hired a horse, I proceeded on my journey to Mount Vernon, the burial-place of Washington. The guide-book told me that “the road to it was uninhabited and difficult to trace;” but setting forth on my pilgrimage, and travelling over a sandy, poor country, I managed tolerably well for the first few miles; until, arriving at the meeting of four roads, I was at a complete non-plus , there being neither sign-post nor living being from whom I might gain further information. Trusting to my horse and good luck, I rode on at a brisk trot for several miles, when, meeting a woman, I discovered that I had taken a wrong road, so struck off at once into the forest; and after losing my temper ten times, and my road twice as often, by an hour after mid-day I arrived at the lodge-gates of Mount Vernon. I was obliged to adopt this inconvenient method of travelling, as the steam vessels from Alexandria, which pass within 200 yards of the house, are not permitted to land passengers, on the plea that great depredations were committed amongst the trees and gardens. The proprietor certainly does not appear to encourage pilgrims to the tomb; the road through the grounds from the lodge to the house being, if possible, worse than the highway, and running for a considerable distance up a deep ravine, and over the rough stony bed of a winter's torrent. It was much the fashion, during my stay in America, for the Volunteer Corps and “Republican Associations of young men,” to make a pilgrimage to the tomb in a body; and the middle and southern States, who never allow an opportunity of having a laugh against their Yankee brethren to escape them, say, that the order forbidding steamers to land their passangers arose in consequence of a gentleman cutting so many walking-sticks from the sacred ground that, upon his return to Boston, he made a good round sum of money by retailing them at a dollar each. The house was originally built by Lawrence Washington pleasant residence during several months. The thermometer frequently stood as high as ninety-six degrees in the shade at Gadsby's hotel: the members of Congress might daily be seen crawling along the Pennsylvania Avenue towards the Capitol, with umbrellas to protect them from the powerful rays of the sun, at ten o'clock; and though receiving eight dollars per day (1 l 14 s. ,) their places were not sinecures, the House only adjourning for an early dinner at two o'clock, and then sitting again until sunset, and once until nine at night",

    "Description":"So many Americans had spoken to me of the grandeur and magnificence of Broadway, some even asserting that no street in London was superior to it, that I felt very much disappointed, and think that the same comparison might have been more justly drawn with Liverpool. The shops in it certainly cannot vie with those even in the latter town; but, in the number of equipages, New-York excels it, and far outvies London, or any English town, in its hackney coaches, which are so remarkably neat, and even handsome, that a foreigner might be well excused for imagining them to be private carriages. Broadway is throughout the day thronged with gay vehicles and equestrians, and a perpetual stream of that convenient but uncomfortable London Carriage, an “omnibus,” not the least remarkable thing about those in New-York bring that (though every man affects to despise titles and rank) they are all named “Lady Clinton,” “Lady Washington,” “Lady Van Rensselaer,” and others as strangely inconsistent. Sometimes, too, servants in half livery may be seen sitting on the box of a carriage, whose door-pannels are ornamented with a crest. This street is about three miles in length, and eighty feet in width, extending in nearly a straight line from one end of the city to the other. The streets are clean for an American city; but the appearance of the cholera had caused the corporation to exert themselves in attending more closely to the cleanliless of them. Some wag observed, in one of the public prints, that the scavengers had actually dug down to the pavement in one or two places, and that the city was cleansed tho-roughly. Manhattan Island, on which the city stands, and which is formed by the Hudson, the Harlæm, and East rivers, with the bay on the south, is fifteen miles in length, and from two to three in breadth. The Old Town, near the bay, much resembles an English one, but the northern part of it is as regularly laid out as Philadelphia or Washington, and numbers about eighty-seven streets. The wharfs are similar to those of Philadelphia, but not quite so ragged, and extend much farther up the east than the Hudson, or North River, as it is generally called, thus depriving the great discoverer of the honour of giving his name to the noble stream. On the south-west point of the island, overlooking the bay, is a fine public promenade, of from 500 to 600 yards in length, and 150 in breadth, prettily laid out in walks, and planted with trees. In the evenings it is generally crowded with citizens, who assemble to derive the benefit from a pleasant breeze off the water, or listen to a band that frequently plays in the Castle garden, which is connected with he walk by a wooden bridge, upon which, and along the whole extent of the public walk, may be seen various Cockney anglers, of most persevering dispositions. The former promenade is called the Battery, from having in the olden times of the Dutch settlers, or during the Revolutionary war, mounted a few guns; and the Castle garden in a similar manner possesses no garden, nor could it ever have possessed one, being a modern stone fort, with twenty-eight embrasures, built upon a solid rock, which appeared but a short distance above the water. This being an unprofitable kind of investment of funds, has been let by the Corporation to a publican, who has converted it to a much more profitable use, charging sixpence sterling for admission, and giving a ticket, so that the visitor may enjoy a stroll upon the upper platform of the fort, admire the view, and then call for a glass of some liquor at the bar, for which he is not charged any thing. The Battery, nevertheless, is the most pleasant promenade in New-York, and far excels any thing else of the kind in America.",

The town having some high bluff rocks rising at the back of it, is situated at the head of a bay of considerable extent, which affords an excellent shelter from the sea, and a small battery, dignified with the appellation of Fort Hale, occupies a point about two miles up the bay. When within half a mile of the pier, the steamer was boarded by a health officer who expressed himself satisfied with the Captain's word that there were no cholera cases on board; so, being permitted to land, I proceeded to an hotel in a large square called the Green, about three-quarters of a mile in circumference. It has three churches in a line near the centre of it, and at a short distance in another line a state-house (which is almost a fac-simile of the Philadelphian bank and a Methodist chapel; while the opposite side of the square is occupied by the large brick buildings of the Yale College. The square as also the streets of the town (which contains 11,000 inhabitants) are planted with fine elm trees, which keep them, however, exceedingly wet and dirty. The college has four houses. for the lodging of the students, 158 chapels, and a Lycæum (in which are the recitation rooms) and possesses an excellent library. It was commenced in 1700, by the recommendation of eleven of the principal ministers of neighbouring towns, who had been appointed to adopt such measures as they should deem fit for the regulation of a college. Its first commencement was held at Saybrook in 1702, and removed to New Haven in 1717. The Hon. Elihu Yale, Governor of the East India Company, being its principal benefactor, his name was bestowed upon it. It is considered one of the best colleges in the States, and from four to five hundred young men study at it.",

There are nine or ten churches to 8500 inhabitants; and, on walking out in the afternoon, there was literally not one person to be seen in the streets. Feeling rather ashamed at being apparently the only absentee from divine service, I proceeded a short distance out of the town to the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, which was the first establishment of the kind in the States, and is partly conducted by a gentleman who has the misfortune to be afflicted himself in the same manner. The building is a very extensive one, situated on an eminence overlooking the town, and generally contains from sixty to seventy inmates...The Connecticut River, on whose right bank the town stands, is about 300 yards broad, and connected with the large manufacturing village of East Hartford, one mile distant, by a bridge of seven arches, at which the sloop navigation ceases. The town would be a very handsome one, if a little more attention were paid to the cleanliness of the streets; but, like most American towns, the dirt was six inches deep in them. Grass, rank docks, and other weeds, were growing on every side of the State House and one half the square, which was cut up in every direction, after a heavy shower of rain, by deep ruts and innumerable water-courses.",

On the eastern bank, it is built at the foot of a range of heights which run parallel with the stream, and upon the summit of them are the two large tasteless buildings of the Brown University. An Englishman's ideas of a college are associated with cloisters, antique piles, and black-lettered volumes, and he would fix the seat of the genius of learning in some venerable pile of building which possessed an air of grandeur. He could scarcely reconcile to himself a four-storied, redpainted, brick house as her abode; and would pardon her for taking alarm and fleeing from such a spot, where too her votaries are distinguished by no classical garb. I believe it is rather the case with this College, which does not bear so high a name as that at Hartford or New-Haven, or Cambridge; but, of all the public buildings in America, I thought the colleges were the most tasteless. Steam-vessels and sloops navigate the river up to the bridges, which connect the two towns; where the stream is considerably contracted by the piers which have been thrown out, but immediately above them it expands again into a fine cove or bay of half a mile in width, with neat houses encircling it. The town containing between 16,000 and 17,000 inhabitants is a manufacturing place of considerable importance, and printed calicoes of very durable colours are struck off. In the cotton works many very young children are employed; but there were propositions (as in England, by Mr. Sadler) to limit the number of working hours.",

Fort Woolcott is situated upon an island in the centre of the harbour, between Fort Adams and the town. There is another fort upon Rose Island, a short distance above the town, at the entrance to the Naraganset River; while a fourth occupies a rocky point called the Dumplings, at the entrance to the bay, opposite to Fort Adams. The town is a fashionable watering place for the southern people, there being a most extensive and beautiful beach upon the opposite side of the neck to that upon which the town is built, and having the additional luxury of a fine sea breeze, which sets in during the summer months from about nine in the morning until sunset. The surrounding country is rather devoid of trees, a complaint which a traveller will not often have to make in America, but so many are rising up round the pretty residences in the vicinity of the town, that in a few years it will be a most attractive place. After making one or two almost ineffectual attempts at taking a sketch of the town, against which I believe there was neither pain nor penalty attached, I again rose, having rested myself for two hours in gazing upon the scene, and, regaining the road, proceeded on my journey, almost wicked enough to wish that the cholera might pay the inhabitants of New-port a visit, in return for their inhospitable conduct to travellers, and those who were seeking a place of refuge.",

    "Description":"The city of Boston is built upon a peninsula, which is joined to the main land by a very narrow neck on the southern side; it contains about 70,000 inhabitants, and vies with any of its southern neighbours in the situation and beauty of its public and private dwellings. In 1630, at its foundation, the Indian name was Shawmut, which was changed to Trimountain, from the three hills upon which it is now built; subsequently it received its present name, in honour of a minister who emigrated from Boston in Lincolnshire. Upon the other sides of the peninsula, communication is kept up with the mainland by several strong wooden bridges varying in length from 1500 to 3500 feet, and on its western side by a pier of solid materials 1½ mile in length, and above 80 feet in width. The bay is a most magnificent one, and equals that of New-York, but in a different style of beauty. The Boston bay is on a much more grand and extensive scale containing 75 square miles and studded with more than 100 islands and rocks, the only ship channel being between Forts Warren and Independence on Governor's and Castle islands. The land which almost encircles the bay is high and cultivated, and numerous towns and villages are scattered over it. When entering the harbour from sea, I think it much more beautiful than New-York. The city rises in a much prettier and more showy form upon its three hills, and the whole is surmounted by the lofty dome of the State House. But then there is no view from any part of Boston to be compared with the bewitching one from the battery in New-York on a still summer's evening. As to literary character, it is the Athens of the western world; the number of its literary publications is very great, being 6 newspapers daily, 4 three times a week, 8 twice a week, and 16 weekly; 2 weekly magazines, 2 semi-monthly, 11 monthly (principally religious,) 4 every two months, 5 quarterly, and 1 semi-annually; and 4 new-year annuals;—in addition to which the British Quarterly Review is re-printed. As an historical spot, it ranks far above all others in the west, having been the birth-place of American Independence; and, the city having arrived to maturity before that event took place, it more resembles an English one than any other in the States. I had become rather weary of straight streets, which, though in some respects convenient, are tiresomely monotonous to a stranger, and was glad to be once again walking in those of a description I had been most accustomed to. The environs are more pleasing also than those of Philadelphia and New York; the country being intersected with delightful rides, every one of which affords some fine view. The “common” in which the State House is situated is an open park, containing 75 acres of broken and abrupt ground, with a promenade and double row of fine trees round it. It was reserved in perpetuum by the first settlers for a parade-ground, or other public purposes, and is surrounded upon three sides by elegant private dwellings and several churches, the fourth side being open to a wide bay. There is a fine drooping old elm in the centre of it, near a serpentine sheet of water, which the inhabitants are taking every possible pains to preserve, by binding the large, broad, spreading branches, and connecting them with each other by strong belts and bars of iron. The State House, at one corner of the common, is on elevated ground, 30 feet higher than the street, from which a broad flight of steps leads to the great hall of 50 feet in length and breadth, and 20 high, which, with the treasurer's, adjutant, and quarter-master general's offices, occupies the lower story. In a building attached to the basement story is a marble statue of Washington, executed by Chantrey at a cost of 15,000 dollars (3100 l. sterling,) and considered, by those who knew the original at the time. of life it is intended to represent, a most striking and admirable likeness. The figure is concealed by the Roman toga, supported over the breast by the left hand; while the right, pendent at the side, holds a scroll; it is placed upon a high pedestal, which (proh pudor!) is surrounded on every side by the stains of squirted tobacco juice. It is well that a strong iron railing prevents visitors from approaching with in less than seven feet, or the statue itself would be barely sacred from such a filthy pollution. The second story contains the fine and spacious Representanve's Room, and Senate Chamber; from the dome, which is 230 feet above the level of the sea, a most extensive view presents itself of the beautiful harbour and surrounding country. The exterior of the building, at a distance, is a striking object; but, upon closer inspection, it is found to be constructed merely of the common brick, painted white. The entrance being through an arched front, which supports a colonnade of Corinthian columns, extending 94 feet, the full length of the centre of the building, has a handsome appearance, but the two wings, 40 feet each in length, look extremely bare, and might be much improved in architectural beauty. The Mason's Hall, on the opposite side of the Common, isa fine granite building, with Gothic windows and towers; and the Park Church near it has a highly ornamental and light spire.",

    "Description":"In the Navy-yard, which is at Charlestown (built on another peninsula, connected with Boston by bridges, and containing 7000 inhabitants,) a most excellent Dry Dock is constructing. It is the only one in the country, and is formed of hewn granite upwards of 300 feet in length and 80 in width; the chamber intended for line-of-battle ships to lie in is 200 feet in length, by 18 or 20 in depth. It has double gates, an outer one being required to break the motion of the sea. Two line-of-battle ships and a large frigate were drawn up under cover of the sheds, and three other vessels of war lay alongside the pier. The vessels on the stocks were in the same state of forwardness as those at the other Navy-yards, and could be prepared for sea in a few weeks. Not a workman was employed about any of three line-of battle ships and four frigates which I saw on the stocks at Washington, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and Charlestown, though much work was in progress connected with other branches of the navy. Within a short distance of the Navy-yard is Breed's Hill, upon which the memorable battle of the 17th of June, 1775, was fought; and generally known by the name of Bunker's Hill, which lies half a mile to the north west, at the entrance of the narrow neck of the peninsula. Being sixty feet higher than Breed's Hill, it was the intention of the American general to defend it; but the officer entrusted with the charge of the troops, through some mistake, led them to the one on the point of the peninsula, within range of the British batteries upon Copp's Hill in Boston. The redoubt which 185 they threw up during the night, being attacked the following day by the royal troops under the command of Generals Howe and Pigot, was carried with great slaughter, after a most determined resistance on the part of the revolutionists. In the redoubt, on the summit of the hill, and on the spot where General Warren fell, a monument was commenced on the 17th of June, 1825; the corner stone was laid by Lafayette, but was subsequently taken up and relaid, the foundation not being deep enough to resistthe action of the frost. For the last three or four years no farther progress has been made, though the entire side of the hill is covered with the requisite materials; want of funds is the reason advanced for not finishing it; but a stranger would imagine that such a city as Boston might in itself contribute more than the requisite sum: at present it is but a monument of the inhabitants' want of spirit. The design is upon a grand scale; an obelisk of granite, 50 feet in diameter at the base, and 220 feet in height. No one would wish to deprive the Americans of the honour of their victories; but I never met one yet who did not claim Bunker's Hill as a splendid triumph over the British arms. In arguing the matter, I always referred them to their own histories of the war, which have the candour to acknowledge that the provincialists retired from the position, after making a resistance even longer than prudence admitted. The works of the Americans to this day prove how ably they blockaded the town, and a series of strong redoubts and entrenchments may be easily traced for a distance of fifteen miles, from Dorchester Heights on the margin of the Bay to Winter Hill on the Mystic River.",

    "Description":"Between the village and the Connecticut river, two miles distant, are rich and beautiful meadows, unconfined by fences, but well planted with fruit trees, and being overflowed by the spring freshets, which leave a deposit, the land is as productive as any in the State. A wooden bridge half a mile in length, crosses the river into the prettiest of American towns, Northampton. Nowhere did I see such beautiful villages as in New England, of which Concord in New Hampshire, Worcester and Northampton, rank pre-eminent. The situation of this last is a charming one, in a rich country, upon a noble river, and steam navigation to the ocean. The streets are unlike any thing English. Frame houses possess a neatness 191 and cleanliness of appearance which it is impossible to impart to our heavy town abodes; and, as the material of which they are built can be moulded into more elegant forms, the American houses are generally ornamented with light balconies and porticos, supported by columns of the Doric or Corinthian order. I thought Northampton the most delightful and enviable place I had ever seen; it is the very realization of a “ rus in urbe ,” the streets being so thickly planted with trees of a primeval growth that their boughs are almost interwoven across the road, and the neat private dwellings and shops beneath them appear like a series of cottages and gardens. The town has been settled nearly 180 years, and contains above 2000 inhabitants. On the opposite side of the river, which is crossed at South Hadley by a horse ferry, two miles distant, is Mount Holyoke, 1070 feet above the level of the river, and a favourite resort of travellers and parties of pleasure. Seven carriages, filled principally with ladies, arrived at the foot of the mount at the same time as myself. The road winds along the side of it through a dense forest of trees, until within 400 feet of the summit, where it is necessary to dismount and clamber over rough loose stones and logs of wood for the remaining distance. But the scene which bursts upon the spectator's view, as he steps upon the bare black rock on the summit— a scene of sublime beauty, of which but an inadequate description could be conveyed— amply repays him for his trouble and fatigue. A more charming day could not have been desired: it was one of those clear American atmospheres which are unknown in our own hazy clime, with just sufficient light floating clouds to throw a momentary shadow over parts of the rich vale, which lay spread out beneath in all the various hues of a quickly ripening harvest. Innumerable white houses, and spires of churches, were seen scattered amongst the trees and along the banks of the smooth but rapid Connecticut (up which a solitary steamer was slowly creeping,) which river in its fantastic and capricious windings returned within a few yards of the same spot, after watering two or three miles of the vale —or, after being concealed at intervals by the hills and woods, would again appear with its silvery surface glistening amidst the dark foliage at the distance of many miles. These objects, and above all, the high and rocky mountains, contrasted with the smiling valleys, altogether formed one of the most magnificent panoramas in the world. Places 160 miles apart from each other were distinctly visible. I soon recognized the bluff rocks near New-Haven, at eighty miles distance, though only 400 feet in height, and could easily trace their rugged and bold outline upon the clear horizon.",

The city, containing about 12,000 inhabitants; occupies an alluvial plain of some extent between the mount and the Hudson River. Having some spare time, I walked through several of the streets, and visited the Episcopal Church, which has a very tasteful Gothic tower: one of the prettiest specimens of architecture I saw in the United States; but the body of the church, not being built in unison with it, gives the edifice the air of a piece of patch-work. An elegant and large Court-house was completed, with the exception of its portico, in a street adjoining the church; but it bore too strong a resemblance to the United States' Bank at Philadelphia, of which I had since seen so many fac-similes, to have man charms for me. The building was entirely of white marble, and modelled after the temple of Theseus at Athens. The gallant “Trojans,” as the inhabitants call themselves, were partaking of the New York panic, and leaving the city in crowds, on account of few cases of cholera being reported.",

From this place to Schenectady the country is dull, uninteresting in point of scenery, and devoid of habitations; but now, having gained the banks of the Mohawk River, a rich alluvial soil presents itself. There is but little worthy of notice in the town, excepting Union College, on an eminence near the road from Troy. Only two large buildings, forming part of what is intended, are at present erected; but several more are to be immediately added, and, the adjoining grounds being spacious, it promises to become a pretty spot. The college has been very liberally endowed by the State to the amount of 300,000 dollars, and the number of students at this time is about 200. Dr. Nott, the President, is not only a good classical scholar, but an excellent and persevering mechanic. Some of his inventions have even gained a considerable name in England, amongst which is an improvement in hot air stoves for heating cathedrals and large buildings. He has expended also large sums of money in experiments upon steamvessels; several of which are constructing upon his plan of having twenty small boilers, instead of two or four large ones, and are considered safer than those generally in use, and equally swift.",

Since the completion of that work, it has augmented to 10,000 souls, and is daily on the increase. The line of canal, which eight years since was on the outskirts, now passes directly through the centre of the city, giving it a pleasing appearance, to which the innumerable wooden bridges with, their light open railing greatly contribute. The inhabitants are well aware of its rising importance, predicting already that the State Government will be removed from Albany, and that the future laws will emanate from their capitol, whose site they have marked out in a square at the upper end of the city, on a rising eminence, whence its dome will be seen by the surrounding country for forty miles. The streets are also laid out in a style befitting the capital of the most populous State in the Union. As a central situation it is more convenient than Albany, which is on the very confines of the State, and three hundred miles from the inhabitants of the western parts of it. A stranger, seeing no manufactories or large mercantile establishments in Utica, finds it difficult to account for its rapid increase, until he discovers that every stream from the neighbouring hills is covered with such speculations, and the margin of every creek is peopled. The goods being transported from the town, it derives all the benefit, without any of the inconvenience, arising from numerous manufactories.",

From the water two or three only are visible above this immense assemblage of red houses; and yet the city contains nine episcopal churches, a great number of public buildings, and charitable institutions without end. Great attention is paid to the education of the poorer classes: the constitution of Pennsylvania declaring, “That the legislature shall, as soon as convenient, provide by law for the establishment of schools, in such manner that the poor may be educated without expense.” Philadelphia has been often described. The streets cross each other at right angles: those running parallel with the river are numbered, second, third, fourth, &c.; the others usually bear the name of some fruit or tree. The word street is usually omitted: in describing the way, a person would tell you that the place you were looking for was in Walnut, below fifth; Sassafras, above second; Mulberry, between seventh and eighth, &c. These streets run over a distance of two miles, from the Delaware to the Schuylkill river, which enters the Delaware about seven miles to the south of Philadelphia. The Bank of Pennsylvania is a small building, but elegantly designed from the Temple of the Muses, on the Illyssus, near Athens.",

    "Description":"Harrisburg is delightfully situated on the Susquehanna. It was here for the first time I saw that beautiful river; in breadth about three quarters of a mile. Its clear and shallow stream is not really slow, but at a little distance it appears as tranquil and unruffled as the surface of a lake. Immediately opposite to Harrisburg is an island, from either side of which a long wooden bridge is thrown to the opposite bank of the river. Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania, and is a thriving, neat and pretty-looking town, containing about four thousand inhabitants. The house of assembly, or capitol, as it is always called in America, is built on an eminence. The sittings of the senate and house of representatives of Pennsylvania were held first at Philadelphia, then at Lancaster, and subsequently for nearly the last twenty years at Harrisburg, which, from its central situation, has been found much more convenient....The view from the dome of the capitol at Harrisburg is very fine; but a much better is obtained from the summit of a hill about a mile behind the town, although, perhaps, the town itself is not seen to such advantage. A great part of the surrounding country is very well cultivated; corn-fields, pasture and woodlands, are distributed over hill and hollow; and occasionally here and there is perceived a small farm-house, of a neater and more English appearance than any I had yet seen. On every side the landscape is terminated as usual by a boundless forest. The Susquehanna seems to lose itself through a gap in the Blue Mountains; and throughout the whole of its course, which is visible for a great distance, its banks and beautiful islands are clothed with the richest foliage to the water's edge. I proceeded along the north bank of the river towards Duncan's Island, and after a ride of eight or nine miles, I arrived at the gap I have just mentioned. Its scenery forcibly reminded me of the Rhine at Drachenfells. The abrupt and lofty hill on the left is not surmounted by a “castled crag,” but it overhangs, perhaps, a nobler river, whose banks are covered with the forest trees of America, instead of being formally scarped for the culture of vines, trimmed like gooseberry bushes. At a short distance from the gap, the river is crossed by an enormous wooden bridge of eight arches, which is very nearly half a mile in length. The bridges in America are usually of wood, of admirable construction, neatly painted, and covered over like many of the bridges in Switzerland.",

It is almost exclusively the property of one English gentleman, who is master of nearly 70,000 acres in that part of the country. While I partook of his hospitality, I was agreeably surprised by the circle of English society, which I found collected under his roof. Several English have made Philipsburg their place of residence. Its advantages consist in a remarkably healthy situation on the western slope of the Alleghanies, where the descent is so gradual as to be hardly perceptible; an easy and constant communication with Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the Ohio; excellent trout-fishing, and shooting in the forest; a very cheap market (a sheep or deer can be bought for a dollar), and excellent medical advice. Uncleared land may be purchased at one, two, or three dollars an acre...At Philipsburg, and in the neighbourhood, are several iron works. I visited a curious screw manufactory there: the machine for heading the screws was invented on the spot, and probably there is not such another to be found any where. It turned out about sixty screws in a minute, and finished them off with a neatness that would excite the surprise even of a mechanist.",

    "Description":"Baltimore, when viewed from the Chesapeake, appears to be built over several low hills, or slopes, and surrounded by others that are considerably higher. Its situation is much finer than that of Philadelphia. It is not so fine as that of New York; but in some respects, is, I think, superior to Boston. When approached by water, the most conspicuous objects are—Washington's monument, the shot-towers, the Roman Catholic cathedral, and the Unitarian church, all scattered in different parts of the city. Washington's monument is a plain column of marble, raised on a square base, 175 feet in height, and surmounted by a colossal statue of Washington. It is seen from a great distance on every side, and commands the finest and most extensive prospect; but I am very much inclined to doubt the taste that placed any other than an allegorical object on the top of a lofty pillar. The size of the column, and its simplicity, are calculated to excite admiration; but in my humble judgment, it would have been much better to have had a really fine statue placed inside the base of the column, than to perch the general upon a height that would make a living admiral feel giddy. Lord Hill's monument, near Shrewsbury, and that to the memory of General Brock, at Queenstown, are, I think, objectionable, for the same reasons. The battle monument is much prettier, although it is somewhat florid in its ornaments: it is fiftyfour feet in height. The column is a circular fasces, symbolical of the Union, twined round with fillets, bearing the names of those who fell on the 12th and 13th of September, 1814; and supporting an allegorical statue of a female, personifying the city of Baltimore, with a bald eagle, the United States' emblem, at her side. The Archbishop of Maryland is the Metropolitan of the States. The Catholic cathedral is a handsome building, with a dome in imitation of the Pantheon. The inside, which is divided into pews, contains two very good pictures from the French school: a descent from the cross, by Paul Guerin, presented by Louis XVI.; and St. Louis burying his dead officers and soldiers before Tunis, by Steuben, presented by Charles X. The descent from the cross is much and deservedly admired. It has the merit of being free from that tedious detail that is usually to be observed in the works of French artists, who paint every thing as it is, and not as it appears. It occurred to me, that the body of Christ did not sufficiently rest on the ground, as intended. The latter picture displays more of the French taste. I did not like it so well, but many prefer it to the other. At Baltimore, is the University of Maryland, which ranks very high as a medical school. The average expenses of a student are one hundred and twenty dollars per annum. It has also professors in law and divinity. St. Mary's College and Baltimore College are also justly celebrated throughout the Union; the latter will accomodate one hundred and fifty students, who are instructed, by twelve professors, in the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, &c. The city also contains a good museum, which I did, and many more public buildings, which I did not visit, as I could not learn that there was any thing in them particularly deserving of attention. The theatre was not open.",

    "Description":"As I approached Pittsburgh the forest became less extensive, and the country exhibited a more general appearance of cultivation, although it may be broadly asserted that the Americans are at least fifty years behind us in agriculture; yet there are many gentlemen's estates on which more than ordinary care and labour have been bestowed, and which, consequently, are far in advance of others. I observed some good farming adjacent to the road. Some part of the country I am speaking of, might have been mistaken for the more woody parts of England, had it not been for the worm or zigzag fence which is in universal use throughout the United States, and offers but a poor apology for the English hedge row, although they are sometimes composed of cedar logs. Pittsburgh is built on the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, both of them being about a quarter of a mile in width, whose united streams form the Ohio. They are both passed by a fine wooden bridge. The city contains 12,000 inhabitants; but if the suburbs are included in the calculation, its population will amount to nearly 23,000. It may be called the western capital of Pennsylvania. It manufactures annually about 18,000 tons of iron, and the same quantity of steel. It has also an extensive manufactory of cotton and glass. Bituminous coal is found in the greatest plenty in the neighbourhood, and in consequence of the smoke and black dust from the manufactories, the shop-keepers complain that it is impossible to keep any thing clean. I entered Pittsburgh on the 4th of July, on which day, as every one knows, the Declaration of Independence was signed at Philadelphia. It is, of course, always and universally a day of rejoicing in the United States. The militia are called out, a public dinner is always given in every town and village in the Union and an appropriate oration is delivered by the appointed orator of the day.",

    "Description":"Louisville is about ninety miles from the cave. For the last twenty, the road runs along the banks of the Ohio, passing through the most magnificent forest of the beech trees I had ever beheld. There is nothing remarkable in the appearance of Louisville. It is a large and regularly built town, containing 11,000 inhabitants. From this place the larger steamboats start for New Orleans. Those that come from Pittsburgh are of smaller dimensions, on account of the shallowness of the water. The course of the Ohio from Pittsburgh to Louisville is about 600 miles, and thence, to its confluence with the Mississippi, is nearly 300 more. The length of the Mississippi, from its junction with the Ohio, is 1200. The falls, or rapids of the Ohio, are immediately below Louisville, and part of them may be seen from the town.",

    "Description":"The wharfs and buildings at Detroit extend along the river side for about a mile, and exhibit much of the bustle of a commercial town. The streets are spacious and regular,—the largest is more than half a mile in length, and contains some excellent shops and a capital hotel. That part of the bank upon which the city is built, is slightly elevated above the rest of the country, and commands a view which, although generally flat, is far from being uninteresting. The farms are laid out in narrow slips of land, which run parallel to each other, and at right angles to the river, reaching to the edge of the forest, distant about two miles from the city. By this means the first settlers were enabled to build their habitations within a short distance of each other; they had a smaller space of road to keep in repair, and afforded each other a mutual support against the sudden attacks of the Indians. At Detroit, the American General Hull surrendered to General Brock during the last war, but the city was subsequently retaken, previously to the battle of the Thames.",

    "NameOfTraveler":"Godfrey Thomas Vigne",
    "YearOfTravel":1833,
    "Description":"I entered Boston by the light of innumerable lamps, that plainly marked the direction of its many bridges, and took up my quarters at the Tremont hotel,—decidedly, taken altogether, the best house in the United States. The table and the bed-rooms were equally good, which is not the case at any other I had seen. In appearance it more resembles a government building than a hotel. Breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper are served up, as usual, at a certain hour; and although that hour at breakfast time is liberally extended, yet if it happens that a person be detained too long, he must either go without his dinner, or put up with cold and disfigured viands placed before him with an ill grace by a tired waiter, or pay extra for a meal expressly served up for him; as the hotel charges are two, or two dollars and a half a-day, and it makes no difference whether he attends the table d'hote or not. The principal theatre is exactly opposite the Tremont. The front is ornamented with Ionic pilasters supporting an entablature and pediment. The interior is tastefully arranged, but is seldom visited by the first circles. The Indian name of Boston was Shawmut, its first English appellation was Trimountain, and its present name was given in 1630. At an early day after my arrival, I took the opportunity of ascending the capitol, which stands on the most elevated corner of “the Common.” The Common, according to the usual English signification of the word, deserves a better name, as it is the prettiest promenade in the States. It contains about seventy-five acres, disposed in a sloping direction from north to south, varied by other eminences, of which the most conspicuous is formed by the not yet quite levelled remains of the British fortifications of 1775. It is surrounded by trees, and the best houses in Boston; some of them being large and handsome, and not the less deserving of the epithet because they are of a stone colour, or any other than that of red brick. But at Boston generally I observed greater taste in this respect than in any other of the cities which I visited. On one side of the Common is a mall, or promenade, formed by parallel avenues of fine elm trees; but yet, notwithstanding the beauty of its situation, it is deserted by the Boston belles for the gay glitter of the fashionable shops in Cornhill or Washington street. To the best of my recollection, every capitol or state-house that I have seen, or of which I have seen a picture, is surmounted by a dome or cupola,—that of Boston is particularly conspicuous; but the smoothness of its exterior is but ill assorted with the richness of the Corinthian columns in the facade: it should be grooved like the dome of St. Paul's. The present heavy appearance of the cupola at Washington would be very much improved if it were altered in a similar manner. The capitol at Boston contains a very fine statue of Washington, by Chantrey. From the top is obtained a fine panoramic view of the whole city, with the bay, its islands, and their fortifications; its bridges, wharfs, and enormous warehouses. On the north is the memorable Bunker's Hill, with part of the fine obelisk that is to be; the navy-yard, and the suburb of Charlestown. The bay of Boston, like that of New York, is fondly thought by some of the inhabitants of each city to be as fine, if not superior in beauty to that of Naples;—whether they have seen it or not, is of little consequence; the bay of Boston, with its flat treeless islands and head-lands, shall be as fine as the bay of Naples, and so may it remain! The city resembles Baltimore more than any other in the Union: as a collection of buildings it is prettier, but I prefer the environs of the latter city to the more distant hills that form the amphitheatre of Boston, which is too large to add much effect to the landscape. Boston contains 70,000 inhabitants, and the first bridge and the first canal in the United States were constructed there. It appeared to me the neatest city in the Union; and although there is no edifice particularly striking, yet there are many that are handsome, and there is an air of civic importance pervading every street in the place, so that the eye does not easily detect the absence of any object that is necessary to complete the appearance of a place of such pretensions as Boston. The Faneuil Hall, named after the founder, who lived a hundred years ago, must not be forgotten. It is the cradle of American liberty; because, within its walls were held and heard the consultations and the eloquence of those, who, more than fifty years back, were first aroused to resentment and resistance by the obstinacy of the government of England. It contains an original full-length portrait of Washington in his regimentals, by Stewart. The figure is excellent, but the horse is very indifferently executed. The other ornaments in the hall, are emblematical of the purposes to which it is applied. Public meetings and dinners are held there, and the company usually leave behind them the decorations that have been mottoed for the occasion. The name of “Skryznecki” was very conspicuous, among a multitude of others.",

    "Description":"New York is the greatest commercial city of the United States. It possesses many advantages; its geographical position, near the centre of the Atlantic States; its port, open at all seasons of the year; its situation, at the debouchure of the mighty Hudson, which affords an easy navigation for sloops for one hundred and sixty miles. The Erie and Champlain canals open a communication with the northern and western States, by which they are supplied with merchandise, and their surplus produce is exported. The East River opens a channel for intercourse with New England, where extensive manufactories are established. From the south it receives the produce of Virginia, the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia. The establishment of regular packet-ships to England and France brings the earliest intelligence of the markets in those countries. The extensive commerce with almost every port of Europe, Asia, and America. From the continual intercourse with Europe and the interior of the United States, the price of stocks at New York has a great influence on the monied transactions of the continent. Ten or twenty thousand strangers are resident in the city during most seasons of the year. The situation of New York is agreeable; on the east and west bounded by the Hudson and East rivers, and by a magnificent bay on the south. It covers an extent of ground three miles long from north to south, and nearly one mile wide. The city is regularly built. Near the centre is the Broadway, a street nearly three miles long, and eighty feet wide. The other avenues are straight, cross each other at right angles, and slope from Broadway to the rivers on either side. The side walks are paved with gneiss and mica slate. The houses are built of small red bricks, neatly painted, a custom derived from the first Dutch inhabitants. In the suburbs there are many houses built of wood; these are occasionally burnt or pulled down, to make room for more substantial edifices. Sometimes these wooden houses are moved on rollers to a greater distance from the centre of the city, and it is not unfrequent to meet them on their passage. Some houses in New York are built of white marble; they remind the traveller of the palaces in the commercial cities of Italy. This species of limestone is abundant near the city, and will be generally introduced. A contrast is exhibited in some houses built by the Dutch settlers with bricks brought from Holland, with high, sharp roofs; they are preserved on account of their antiquity. The modern houses have green lattices to the windows, and the rooms on the first floor communicate by folding doors.",

A circular earthen fort of that period remains in a commanding position, overlooking the marshy ground in front. On the opposite range of hills the battle took place, in 1776; and the Americans, being defeated, had to retreat to their fortified lines. By the mill, further to the south, is a narrow bridge, where General Sullivan and Lord Stirling were taken prisoners.",

    "Description":"Albany , the capital of the state, is one hundred and fifty miles from New York. It is advantageously situated for commerce, at the head of sloop navigation, and at the termination of the Erie and Champlain canals. State Street is a fine broad avenue in the centre of the city, with the Capitol, on the brow of the hill, at one extremity. The other is blocked up with houses, or it would afford a fine view over the river and the surrounding country. Albany exhibits marks of its Dutch founders. Many houses are built of small bricks, with their gable ends to the street. Some have been described in the history of Irving. Van Tromp Street is named after the celebrated Dutch Admiral. On the east bank of the river, one mile south of the city, is a mansion, erected forty years since, with loop holes and narrow windows, that it might, in case of necessity, be defended against the Indians. The rapid advance of civilization may be noticed by this fact. It shews, at that recent period, it was necessary to guard against their incursions. At that time the sloops were usually a fortnight in sailing to New York, and, to convey the passengers on shore, had a large tree hollowed out into a canoe. There are several cascades within a few miles of the city; to these I was accompanied by my friend Dr. J—. The rapids of Norman Kill are worthy a visit. A small river dashes over ledges of rock, and the stream is confined by precipitous banks covered with forest trees. To form a harbor for the immense number of canal boats which arrive at Albany, a pier has been constructed four thousand feet long, and fifty feet wide. It is made of piles driven into the bed of the river, and filled with earth. Warehouses are built on the top of the pier. When the canals are open, this harbor presents a busy scene; hundreds of boats are collected, bringing the various productions of the West and North; iron, timber, and marble, from the territory near Lake Champlain; flour, wheat, maize, flax-seed, gypsum, and the riches of the West. Emigrants come here with their families to take a passage in boats for the western country. The capitol is advantageously situated on the summit of the hill, and is built of red sandstone. It is one hundred and fifteen feet long, ninety feet deep, and fifty feet high, with a portico in front.",

At Mr.—'s, formerly a senator in congress, I had the pleasure of seeing a fine collection of minerals, arranged with much taste. At Troy there is a celebrated school for ladies, to which many respectable families send their daughters to be educated. Troy has a Mount Olympus and a Mount Ida in its vicinity. An elevated plateau on the east is worth visiting by every traveller;—the view is sublime. At a distance of several miles, the waters of the Mohawk may be seen, as they fall over the rock of the Cohoes; as the rays of the morning sun shine on the cascade, it seems like molten silver. No other similar view in America. At Troy may be perceived the difference that is made in any country by the pursuit of commerce or agriculture. Formerly on this spot was a solitary farm-house, which contained ten individuals. They owned a canoe, cut out of a tree, in which they sometimes ventured to cross the magnificent Hudson. Now you see a thousand houses, containing seven thousand inhabitants, engaged in commerce. The Hudson is covered with sloops displaying their white sails. On the summit of the hill, half concealed by a wood, is the cemetery of the Vanderhuydens, who, for a century, possessed this land. They lived and flourished on their farms, and their tombs number seven or eight. I was at Troy in winter, and the river was covered with ice. Near the shore large masses were broken, and piled on each other by the tide. The ferries were useless, and all who possessed sleighs took advantage of the season to travel on the river. Sometimes on the breaking up of the ice accidents occur, and the traveller, with his sleigh and horse, suddenly disappears under the ice. In winter the stage-coaches are placed on sleighs, and thus travel with much expedition.",

By a particular mode of naming the streets, a stranger easily finds his way to any part. The whole space between the rivers has been set out for streets and avenues, but the principal buildings are near the Delaware: there the ships unload, and it is the chief mart for business. The ground on which the city stands is nearly level, and the regularity with which it is built gives an air of uniformity displeasing to a stranger....The commerce of Philadelphia was formerly extensive, and the merchants had correspondents in all quarters of the world. For many years after the War of Independence it was the greatest commercial port in America. It has since declined, owing to the superior local advantages of New York. The Delaware is sometimes closed with ice during the winter months, and the port is one hundred miles from the sea, by an intricate navigation. The trade to the interior is considerable. There are some manufacturing establishments in Philadelphia, and several thousand looms are employed. At Kensington and Southwark there are extensive yards for ship-building. One line of packet-ships sails between this port and Liverpool. On the Delaware, two miles from the centre of the city, is a navy yard belonging to the United States. A frigate, pierced for sixty-four guns, was on the stocks. Salt was placed in various parts of her timbers to preserve her from the dry rot.",

In America, as in England, wherever manufactures are established, a new impulse seems to be given to human industry; houses are built and a spirit of improvement is exhibited. Cotton goods are shipped from Providence to all parts of the United States. Brown University is on a hill, overlooking the city; it has three professors and sixty students; but having no legislative patronage and being near the college at Harvard, more amply endowed, it has not increased so rapidly as was expected. On my return from Boston, I again stopped at Providence during the sessions of the Legislature. The members were farmers, mechanics or tradesmen, and few lawyers; they are paid six shillings sterling per diem. The Governor of the State has a salary of £150 sterling; an effort was made in the Legislature to reduce the amount; it was considered too large.

The trade formerly carried on at Newport, has been removed to Providence, which is more centrally situated.

Fort Tammony stands on an eminence, two miles north-west of the town. It occupies a strong position and commands an extensive view. The encampment of the American army on the opposite heights, and the position of the French fleet under Count D'Estaing, were pointed out to me by a resident. But the fields are no longer occupied by contending armies—the husbandman now follows his occupation in peace.

Within the last sixty years there was a gate and wall across the peninsula, to keep out the Indians. When the Revolution commenced, Governor Gage gave orders for the construction of a fortified line near the same place, and the remains are still to be seen, unless lately obliterated. The ditch was wide and deep, and extended from the bay to the interior harbor, and, at high water, converted Boston into an island. Boston contains sixty thousand inhabitants, and carries on an extensive commerce with various parts of the world. The harbor is commodious, and affords anchorage for five hundred ships of war. It is defended by Fort Independence, situated on an island, provided with 200 pieces of cannon. The streets of Boston are crooked; it is said there is not one strait avenue in the whole city. The ground on which it is built is undulating, and it resembles an English town. The streets are kept much cleaner than in any other city in America. A very singular cart or truck is used for the conveyance of goods. They are made of two pieces of timber, about twenty five feet long, placed two feet and a half apart, and resting in the centre on an axle with two wheels. They are drawn by two or three horses, and form a serious impediment to passing the streets, besides being very dangerous. Many houses towards the exterior of the city are built of wood, those in the central streets are of brick; all are painted, and furnished with green blinds. It is the fashion in Boston for rich individuals to build very large houses. Some of these are built of marble; others of white granite brought from Chelmsford. Some are constructed of a dark-colored sienite, which has a very sombre appearance, and from the density of the material, these houses must be damp in winter. The pride of Boston is the Park. It occupies thirty acres of ground, the surface gently undulating, and surrounded by a wide mall, bounded by a double row of the Ulmus pendula, or American elm. Here the reviews take place, and on public occasions, which are numerous in America, it forms a fine field for display. The bridges which connect Boston with the main-land are four in number. They are constructed on piles driven into the bottom of the harbor, which varies from five to twenty feet in depth. They are open and exposed to the weather, and, in consequence, the planks are obliged to be renewed every five years. In Pennsylvania, where the bridges are protected by a roof, they last thirty years without repair, and preserve the traveller from the inclemency of the sky. One bridge is twelve hundred yards long, the others are of scarcely inferior dimensions. Within a short distance of Boston, the bridges thrown over the various creeks and bays are supposed to be ten miles in extent, if united in one line. A mound of stone, filled with earth, has been erected across the higher part of the harbor, at an expense of five hundred thousand dollars. Two large reservoirs are formed; one is kept full of water, and the other empty, by gates which allow the efflux and reflux of the tide. An immense water-power is thus created, and mills are erected on the dam which separate the two reservoirs.",

Nahant, twelve miles north-east of Boston, is a small, rocky promontory, extending into the ocean. It is joined to the continent by a narrow peninsula, one mile long, which is overflowed at high water. Quantities of sea-weed are thrown up by the waves on the beach, and the farmers are assiduous in collecting it. At low water, the sandy beach makes a fine road for carriages; at other times, the approach is rough and unpleasant. This is of less consequence, because parties usually arrive and depart by the steam-boat. The rock affords grass sufficient to feed a few sheep, who take a journey every morning over the peninsula, and return to the main land at night.",

    "Description":"Baltimore contains sixty thousand inhabitants, and is built on the river Patapsco, near its junction with the Bay of Chesapeake. At Fell's Point, the port to which foreign vessels resort, there is depth of water sufficient for the largest ships. Small sloops sail up to the town. The growth of Baltimore has been without a precedent, even in the annals of America. It is advantageously situated for commerce: the trade of the Susquehanna chiefly centres in this port, and it has a communication with the interior by excellent roads. Its position is favorable for trade with the West-India Islands and with the ports on the Spanish Main. The sharp schooners built at Baltimore make very expeditious voyages, and are well adapted to the harbors of Mexico. In the last war, the privateers from Baltimore did great injury to the commerce of England, as they almost defied pursuit. The most striking feature in the character of the inhabitants of Baltimore is their fondness for architectural display. In no city of the United States are there so many good buildings. It has been called the City of Monuments, and on every side you behold fountains, churches, columns, monuments, and public buildings, of various descriptions. Many are built in a correct style. The fountains are placed in different parts of the city. The water falls into a marble reservoir, surrounded by a railed inclosure; you descend to the fount by a few marble steps, and the arrangement is at once classical, and of great public utility. The water is conducted underground, from a distance of two miles. The Battle-Monument is a chef-d'œuvre of art, situated in a small square adjoining the main street. A figure of victory rests one hand on a reeded column, representing the fasces of the Roman consuls, but destitute of an axe. It is placed on a square plinth. The names of those who were killed in the engagement with the British troops are inscribed on various parts of the monument.",

    "Description":"Washington, the capital of the United States of America, contains four distinct towns. George town, where commercial business is transacted. Pennsylvania Avenue, near the President's house, and the offices for the departments of the Navy, Army, Treasury, and Foreign affairs. The Capitol and streets in the vicinity. The Navy-yard, surrounded by the houses of artificers. These combined near one spot would make a handsome city, but they are some distance apart. As the power and resources of the United States increase, the city will be enlarged and completed according to the original plan on a magnificent scale. Rents are high and the price of living extravagant. The Potomac flows at the distance of a mile from the Capitol; an extensive marsh intervenes; the exhalations which it produces in autumn are noxious. The senators assembled at Washington breathe an atmosphere similar to that inhaled by the ancient senators of imperial Rome...I visited the Navy yard, but there was nothing very different from establishments at other ports. The Capitol is an immense pile of building, but it was not finished on the exterior, so that I had no opportunity of judging of its general effect as a work of art. It is situated on the brow of a hill, in a commanding position. It contains the Hall of Representatives, Senate Chamber, Supreme Court, Library, Committee-rooms, 199 and apartments for the Speaker of the House and Vice-President. The first impression on entering the Hall of Representatives, is the air of magnificence which prevails. No expense has been spared to promote the convenience of the members; it has an air of luxury resembling the interior of a palace. St. Stephen's Chapel presents a stronger contrast to this Hall, than can be found in any two buildings devoted to the same object. I have not seen the Representative Halls of continental Europe, but I believe that none can vie with that of America in beauty of decoration. The interior of the hall is in the form of a semicircle. The roof is supported by twenty-two columns of breccia marble, surmounted by white marble capitals. On the floor of the Hall are seats for the members, arranged towards the outside of the semicircle, and the chair for the Speaker near the centre. Every member has an arm-chair and a separate table, furnished with a drawer. Over the Speaker's chair is a crimson canopy, surmounted by the figure of an eagle, with her wings extended. Above the base of the cornice is a statue of the Goddess of Liberty, holding in her right hand a baton, with which she points to the hall.",

The drawing-room is an octagon, and has glass folding-doors, which lead on one side into the hall, on the other to the garden and shrubberies. The walls are covered with paintings.

Great numbers of the vultur aura, or Turkey buzzard, attend to feast on the refuse of the fish, and, not being molested, become very bold.

From the mountain in the vicinity, from which the city derives its name, there is a fine view.

    "Description":"Embarking in a steam-boat, I landed in Quebec; and the sight of this magnificent capital of the British Possessions in North America recalled many of those historical recollections of which it is the subject. There are two towns, or, rather, cities—the Lower Town, near the water's edge, where the commercial business is chiefly transacted; and the Upper, which is surrounded by strong fortifications. The Citadel, Fort Diamond, is very strong from its natural situation, and the large sums which have been laid out upon its works. The British flag waves proudly from its summit. The Chateau of St. Louis is the Government House, where his Excellency Lord Aylmer, Governor-in-chief of the British North American Provinces, resides, whose liberal and enlightened policy probably gives as much satisfaction to the Canadians as any British Governor can possibly do. Paying no taxes and possessing an extensive and fertile country, the Canadians ought to be happy. I should be wanting in gratitude were I not to express my obligations to his lordship for his polite invitations while I was resident at Quebec. The views near Quebec are numerous. The Plains of Abraham, General Wolfe gained a victory and received his death-wound, and where his adversary, Montcalm, fell— Montmorenci, unsurpassed by any cataract in America in the height of its cascade—the wooded banks of the St. Lawrence—and the fortified city-walls—present a unique and sublime scene. The Literary and Historical Society devote much attention to exploring the history of the province, and have made large collections in the various departments of natural history. In winter, Quebec presents a scene of gaiety. Dinner-parties at the Chateau and at the houses of the merchants and civilians succeed each other rapidly. Three regiments are usually stationed at Quebec, and the Tandem Club muster twenty-five or thirty splendid equipages. To my friend W. Sheppard, Esq., of the Woodlands, and many other gentlemen, I was indebted for acts of hospitality which proved that the good old British feeling had lost none of its kindness by being transplanted to another hemisphere.",

    "Description":"Baltimore has as much the appearance of prosperity and enterprise, in proportion to its size, as perhaps any city in America. The broad and straight streets are lined with large stores and dwellings, some of which rival in taste the best in the country, and are thronged with well-dressed and busy people. The monuments, rising high in the air from open squares, give an imposing effect; while the shipping in the river and harbour, and the noble railroads extending towards Susquehanna and the Ohio, with which it is designed to open a direct communication, indicate that the inhabitants have the intelligence and the ability to accomplish great things, to promote that commerce which is the main-spring of the city. The number of stage-coaches which arrive and depart is truly astonishing. Scarcely a quarter of an hour passed, when I was so situated at the Indian Queen as to observe the street, without the alighting of travellers or the strapping on of more baggage; and frequently several stage-coaches stood at once before the door. The travelling by steamboats and railroads is also very great; so that when navigation is open and Congress is in session, the place is one of our greatest thoroughfares. The multitudes coming from the West impress one with the rapid increase of population in those flourishing regions. Baltimore has few monuments to public intelligence worthy of the name. There are few objects which I have seen, that convey the idea, so gratifying to a stranger and so honourable to the citizens, that in this place knowledge is duly appreciated, and useful learning is shared by all classes. I speak of monuments as the Europeans use the word: that is, as public edifices. The University can scarcely be said to exist in any branch but the medical department, which has above one hundred students. The Athenæum has 42,000 volumes in its library. Public education is improving rapidly. Four fine schoolhouses have been recently erected. No. 4, in Hanover-street, is a beautiful specimen of architecture, being constructed of whitish granite, with a tasteful façade. These buildings are much more ornamental than the public schools of New-York. May the interior prove but as useful, and Baltimore will have abundant reason to value her new acquisitions",

    "Description":"Philadelphia has beauties and excellences of its own. None of our other cities has so fine a kitchen-garden as Southwark, or displays so much of the beauty of utility and, uniformity in its streets. In justice, however, I must allow that no suburbs can be more forbidding, and no introduction to a large town less promising, than the access by some of the great routes. I hope the boasted literary character of the citizens is not more apparent than real. Whether it be so or not, I sincerely wish them ten-fold of this commendable quality, which they value enough at least to claim the credit of it. We need not wish to institute exact comparisons between the intellectual merits of any of our cities, lest the aggregate should reflect upon the country. It were much better to labour zealously by combined exertions to increase the whole stock. Why Philadelphia should not be the Athens of America, I am sure I cannot tell, nor what should prevent Baltimore, Boston, or New-York. The people have all the means within their reach. We are in the habit of attributing considerable literary honour to some of the cities of Europe, the inhabitants of which are bound on every hand by restrictions which greatly impede them; while we, insensible of our advantages, so superior in many respects, indolently sigh for the time when learning will take up its abode among us. It probably is in the power of individuals of intelligence, virtue, and influence, now living, by only coming out as the decided champions of knowledge, to effect a speedy and total change of things in the United States. But timidity on one side, old habits on another, and business all around, hem in and shoot down all the hopes we entertain of any of our citizens here and elsewhere. Punning is the perversion of the use of words; and the Philadelphians are notorious punsters. Some of them will manufacture more puns in a half hour than you may hear elsewhere in a twelvemonth. They have some fine institutions which promote solid learning among different classes, such as the Athenæum, Franklin Library, and sundry societies which provide lectures, books, &c. In medical institutions they are of course first. The general aspect of the city certainly must invite the mind to study and reflection, one would think, more than that of most other towns in the Union. How anybody can pursue a straight train of thought while threading the crooked lanes and alleys of New-York and Boston, especially with the din of the former in his ears, it is difficult to tell. There is one reason why I prefer Philadelphia; I feel the persuasion always upon me that every thing is clean. The breadth and uniformity, of the streets favour cleanliness, and a great deal of washing and scrubbing is visible; for whatever house you enter, you see hydrants, and tubs, and baths, and rills of living water, and have the satisfaction of reflecting that hogsheads and rivers of it are daily used to good purpose.",

The annual celebration of Yale College had been changed this year, but did not fail to collect a large concourse of persons from different parts of the country, with, as frequently happens, some foreigners of literary taste and intelligence. There is scarcely any thing better calculated to give pleasure to a friend of learning than to visit this delightful city on such an occasion. It seems as if New-Haven had been originally planned for the site of a university; and almost as if every public as well as every private house had been erected, every garden laid out, every court-yard and public square beautified, and every tree planted and trained, with direct reference to its appearance and convenience as a seat of learning. The central square, which is a noble quadrangle of eight or nine hundred feet, surrounded by double rows of large elms, and divided by a street that is completely arched over with thick foliage, although it is the site of four of the finest public buildings, and shows the fronts of handsome mansions on three of its sides, affords the university its place of honour, for the six college buildings are ranged in a long line on the western side, where the ground is highest, and the elevation superior to the chief part of the city. New-Haven is a place of considerable business, with the inhabitants of surrounding towns; but the stores are so remote from this delightful centre, or at least so effectually concealed from view, where this fine display of buildings is visible, that the idea as well as the interruption of business is entirely excluded...The periodical ringing of the bells, with the signs of gathering and dispersing classes, the stillness which reigns through this part of the city during the college exercises, and the student-like aspects of those who, at other hours, traverse the Green, have a tendency to direct the thoughts of the spectator to subjects above the common affairs of life, and by elevating the mind and tranquillizing the feelings, win from the stranger who visits the place a tribute of praise, the source of which may perhaps be more creditable to himself than he imagines. Many travellers have loved to recur to the beauties of NewHaven, and to praise its neat mansions, extensive and blooming gardens, level lawns and luxuriant foliage, who knew not that the chief source of their enjoyment, during their stay, had been derived from another and a higher cause. I have often listened with pleasure to the encomiums thus annually poured, like a spontaneous song, from the hearts of many refined strangers on the spot, because, while it recalls to my own mind agreeable But in praising the fine part of New-Haven, I would not slight the remainder of the city. Many neat and not a few elegant houses are seen in other streets, especially in this vicinity, shaded by the rows of elms which extend far in every direction along those which here cross at right angles. Withdrawing northwardly along two of these, to the distance of about a quarter of a mile, you enter the beautiful “Avenue,” where are collected the houses of several of the oldest and most eminent of the professors of Yale College, with the chaste and elegant mansion of the Poet Hillhouse at the opposite extremity, rising among the trees of a self-planted wood, on a gentle eminence. Nothing could be more pleasing or appropriate than the aspect of this retired spot, when I proceeded in the twilight to visit one of the professors; and nothing more accordant with the scene and the vicinity than the intelligent conversation, mingled with the refined hospitality and friendship shown by such of the neighbours as had assembled, to several literary strangers who presented themselves during the evening.",

    "Description":"Returning to Middletown—the approach to that city is beautiful from almost every quarter. The river spreads out in the form of a lake, and has the aspect, from several points, of being entirely enclosed by the green and cultivated hills around it. In Middletown are several neat and even elegant private houses. The view commanded by the eminence on which the Wesleyan College stands, though inferior in extent to that from a hill in the rear, is varied and rich in an extreme. The fine bend of the river just below, with all that art and nature have done for its banks, here presents itself with great effect. Various manufactures are carried on with success, as the small tributaries of the Connecticut furnish much water-power, but no associations exist for the literary improvement of the people, with the exception of a small social library, founded before the Revolution. This is owing, in a great measure, to the emigration of a large proportion of the young men to commercial cities. The people of this place have had their full share in forming new settlements at different periods, some near and some far distant. Mr. White, the first settler of that part of the State of New-York long known by the general name of Whitestown, and now embracing several counties, went from this place in 17—, with his axe only, and began with his own unassisted strength to clear a forest, which has now given room to a hundred thousand inhabitants. Human ingenuity and enterprise will be exerted where and whenever sufficient encouragement is offered. While many have felt the impulse which drove them to a new country far away, some have been attracted by the facilities for manufacturing afforded by the streams, and others have been persevering in digging freestone from the valuable quarries on the opposite bank of the Connecticut.",

A few of the habitations of old times remain, with many of the sound sentiments and excellent habits of former days; but as the former have been generally improved by modern hands, or at least furnished with comforts formerly unknown, without losing their pristine character or their venerable aspect, so where the good sense, intelligence, and religion of former days are found, they appear to have been rendered at once more valuable among their contrasts, and more extensively useful through the new channels now opened for their exercise. Every thing indicates the great revolution which has taken place within a few years in the employments of the active people of New-England, where so many hands are now engaged in manufactures, and the agency which has converted the nation into a race of nomades during a large part of the year. The strokes of hammers and the rolling of wheels are frequently heard, and many steamboats and stage-coaches are daily arriving and departing.",

    "Description":"No village that I have seen in this part of the country has risen so fast to eminence as a literary place as Amherst. I had admired the bold, swelling, and fertile grazing-country, with its fine views, while it was only a common village. How great has been the change! On one of the finest eminences stands the college, now one of 120 the most flourishing in the Union; and two academies, one for the education of females, are found in other parts of the town. The academies of New-England, and particularly those of Massachusetts, form one of the most important branches of the great machinery of public education. Their history shows the importance of making provision for the instruction of the young, even if some of the means adopted be not immediately found as useful as might be desired. In Massachusetts there are sixty-two academies, which derive funds from various sources; twenty-one of them from a township of land each, in the state of Maine. For some years they were generally in a condition far from flourishing, and some in decay. Public opinion having since improved in relation to instruction, these institutions have been rendered extremely efficient in affording it, and will probably become much more so. There were probably about twenty-five thousand pupils in the academies and private schools of Massachusetts in 1832, out of a population, according to the census of that year, of a little more than six hundred thousand. Six of the academies are devoted exclusively to females, and many of them have a female department. The branches of instruction and discipline have been much improved, but not a little remains to be done. One of the greatest evils with many of them is, that they embrace many branches of secondary importance, even when the pupils are to devote but a few months to their studies. Comparatively intelligent as the common people of this part of the country are supposed to be, they are yet unable to appreciate the real acquisitions of their children, or at least generally apprehend that others cannot.",

    "Description":"Boston is situated on ground favourable to the display of the city from almost every point in the vicinity. The surface rises towards the centre, at Beacon Hill, where the dome of the State House presents a conspicuous object. The acclivity at the same time exposes to view not a few of the larger edifices in different streets. The irregularity of surface, however, has its disadvantages; and some of the streets are inconvenient and even dangerous in slippery seasons. The heart of the city defies the straightening hand of improvement; but the quays and the adjacent streets are of a size and regularity which our larger capitals might envy. The wharves, while they attest the natural defect of the harbour, bear honourable evidence to the taste and enterprise of the merchants; and the market is the most splendid in the country. The fine white granite, which is used so much for columns in New-York, here forms the material of entire and elegant blocks; and, what is of personal interest to travellers, Tremont House is unequalled as a spacious and genteel hotel in the whole Union. The harbour makes a fine appearance from every eminence; and the surrounding country, diversified with bold and swelling hills, populous villages, and elegant country-seats, offers attractions superior to the environs of any of our other cities. Indeed, no pleasanter or more varied tour of ten or fifteen miles could be easily desired than that which may be made, by hard and level roads, round the circuit of Charles River. On the eminences, Washington formed the line of troops with which he besieged Boston in 1775. That end of the horseshoe which overlooks the city 161 from the north is surmounted by the monument of Bunker Hill; while on that which commands the harbour from the south-east, viz. Dorchester Heights, is seen the wall of a circular fort. Hereabouts were some of the earliest settlements in New-England. In literary institutions Boston holds an elevated rank. Without speaking of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Athenæum, &c. &c., Harvard College, which may be regarded almost as in the city itself, is the best endowed, though not now the most flourishing, institution in the Union. Why will not our wealthy countrymen in other States take fire at the noble example which has been set them by the Bostonians, in fostering learning? The public-schools are probably superior on the whole to those of New-York; and if so, of course to all others in the country. Writing, however, is not taught as easily or as well as in New-York; slates not being used for that purpose. The girls' and boys' schools, also, are separated, which must be attended with some inconveniences. The primary schools are vastly inferior, being under a distinct supervision, and controlled by a numerous and unmanageable body of men, most of whom can hardly be expected to keep pace with the improvements in that important department of public instruction. Here, therefore, you find the old-fashioned Ma'am schools—with the poor little children seated all over the room, without apparatus, exercises, singing, or any other humane and intelligent device to render instruction or school-going tolerable. In Boston, however, is enjoyed the great advantage of a comparatively homogeneous population, and a strong prejudice in favour of education.",

    "Description":"Philadelphia contains about 170,000 inhabitants, is the second place in population and the fourth in shipping within the United States, and forms the depôt to a county yearly increasing in population, wealth, and extent. It is situated on the west bank of the Delaware river, which is navigated by vessels of the largest size. Many of the streets are shaded with trees, and all of them remarkably clean and well paved, running parallel and at right angles to each other. The houses are generally built of red brick, those of some of the principal streets having the basement, steps, door, and window sides of white marble. The doors are in general painted white, and have silver handles and knockers. Houses of this description have a chaste and pleasing appearance. Many of the public buildings are elegant, and composed of white marble. The city is generally considered regular, to a fault —the inhabitants the most wealthy, fashionable, and polished in America....The country around Philadelphia through which we passed, forms a striking contrast to that of New Jersey; its general aspect resembling, in all respects, the finest parts of the south of England. Many of the fences consist of well-kept thorn-hedges, studded with wide spreading trees; and many of the crops were excellent, although the soil is not generally in a high state of cultivation. The trees were covered with massy rich foliage, superior to any thing I had ever witnessed before—the effects of which were heightened by the season of the year and prevailing weather, which was warm and moist. Here and there a few pollard trees were seen raising their thin tops and branchless trunks amidst the glorious exuberance of nature; and when viewed in the landscape with the weeping willow, queen of American vegetation, the tendrils of which, clothed with shining leaves, hang in graceful festoons thirty feet in length, show how destitute of beauty are the works of man when compared with those of nature.",

    "Description":"Several days were spent in viewing the beauties of New York and its neighbourhood, which the works of recent travellers render unnecessary for me to describe at length. This city is the first city in the Union, both as to shipping and population, which does not perhaps fall much short of two hundred and forty thousand. It is situated on an island separated from the mainland by a small creek passing betwixt the north and east rivers, which some individuals failed in converting into a canal. From the site of New York as an emporium of trade, there seem to be no limits to the extension of the city and its suburbs. It is already the chief outlet of much of the produce of the eastern parts of the New England states, part of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and almost the whole of New York State. When the canals and railways now in progress are completed, it will also become the depôt for part of the produce of the states of Indiana, Illinois, and the unsurveyed country to the west of Lake Michigan, traversed by the rivers Mississippi and Missouri; and, in the course of events, Upper Canada may be added to the list. The mouth of the Mississippi seems the only outlet, calculated by the extent of inland navigation, to vie with New York; but the warm and pestilential nature of the climate unfits it for the reception of produce, and the residence of man. The public and private buildings vary in size and elegance; and the inhabitants are justly proud of Waverley and Lafayette Places, the houses of the latter being decorated with immense Corinthian pillars, and the whole fronts and steps consist of marble. The streets are not so clean as the inhabitants wish strangers to believe; but as swine seem, in part, intrusted with the charge of removing the filth, they are in as good order as might be expected. The streets appear to be thronged at all hours, noise and uproar prevailing when I retired for the night; ladies and gentlemen on horseback, and the industrious on foot, were bustling forth at five in the morning when I arose. Emblems of aristocratic pride and shameless mendicity occasionally met the eye, in the red vests and peculiar cut coats of serving men standing at the back of luxurious carriages, and in the extended hat supplicating charity. Like other large commercial and manufacturing towns, activity characterises the inhabitants by day, dissipation by night.",

After partaking of tea at an excellent hotel, we walked forth to survey the village, which is reckoned the most beautiful in New England. Northampton is extremely irregular, branching into roads leading in all directions. The houses are composed of wood painted white, with green Venetian blinds. The congregational church is a handsome structure, of the same hue and materials as the houses, and cannot fail to attract the notice of strangers, being one of the best specimens of wood and paint that the United States afford. The ranges of houses are enveloped in trees, amongst which are many magnificent elms, members perhaps of the original forest, reducing modern vegetation to insignificance, and affording umbrageous shelter to the inhabitants. The village stands in the rich valley of the Connecticut, and is surrounded by hills rising nearly 1000 feet in height, wooded to the summit, the chief of which is Mount Holyoke. My impressions of this village, which must be attractive at all times, were perhaps heightened by the circumstances under which it was viewed. A delightful day's travelling had terminated at a comfortable hotel. The air was luxuriously balmy, and a cloudless sun, on the eve of setting, imparted a rich mellow tint to the face of nature, with which every person of observation, leading a country life, must be familiar, and have experienced how decorative it is to vegetation, and soothingly gratifying to human feelings. The houses, decked in white and green colours, which harmonize in rural scenery, and are associated with purity and shade, so desirable during an American summer, were in keeping with the landscape. In seeking for a comparison to Northampton, memory suggested the village of Dirleton, near to my native place in Scotland. But Dirleton, although associated with some of my best cherished recollections, and containing a picturesque ruin shrouded in ivy, and adorned with shrubbery of unrivalled sweetness, yielded to Northampton in situation, buildings, and vegetable beauty.",

On our arrival at Lowell, we observed several stages deposit loads of the same sex, which circumstance was accounted for by the extensive cotton-manufactories situated in the immediate neighbourhood. There is a constant succession of females departing from, and arriving at, Lowell; the high wages of those attending the factories attract such as particularly want a sum of money, after obtaining which they return home. Lowell is the chief seat of cotton manufactures in the United States was formerly a section of the town of Chelmsford, and derives its name from Francis Lowell, who introduced the manufacture of cotton into the States. It is situated at the confluence of the rivers Merrimack and Concord, and has risen into manufacturing importance of late years. The source of its riches and power is the water of the Merrimack, which is conducted to the own by a canal, one mile and a half in length, eight feet deep, and sixty wide, distributed by lateral branches, and again discharged, either into the Merrimack or Concord; the fall being thirty-two feet. Lowell communicates with Boston, from which it is distant twenty five miles, by a canal, and a railway is now forming. The manufactures comprehend those of cotton, and woollen of various kinds, gunpowder, ale, &c. The chief manufacturing company is the Merrimack, which, in 1832, employed four hundred males and nine hundred females, with one thousand looms and twenty-six thousand spindles at work. By the census of Lowell for January, 1828, the total population was 3532, of which 2190 were females. On 12th June, 45 1830, the population was 6477, whereof 4085 were females.",

We enjoyed a walk down the banks of the stream on a lovely evening, but the scenery in the neighbourhood of the fall has been injured by the erection of machinery propelled by the water. The flour mills are numerous, and on the most extensive scale, said to be capable of manufacturing 12,000 bushels of wheat in twenty-four hours. There is an arcade, extolled by the inhabitants, but possessing no attractions to individuals who have seen those of other countries. Rochester is one of the many places illustrative of the growing wealth and population of the United States, and which some English travellers ridicule for want of antiquity, on the principle a withered old beau affects to despise the freshness and elasticity of youth. The first settlement took place in 1812, and the population is now estimated at about 14,000. The situation of the town, communicating with Lake Erie, and the extensive waters to the west, by means of the Erie canal, which is carried over the river in the middle of the town by an aqueduct of free stone, 800 feet long—with Lake Ontario by a railroad—with Montreal by the St Lawrence, and with New York by the Hudson, together with its splendid water power, renders its increase of wealth and population almost without limits.",

Steam-boats arrive and depart almost hourly, and the inhabitants amount to about 8000. The progress of American cities in newly settled districts seems to be uniform;—at first mean wooden houses, which, as wealth increases, gradually give way to better ones of the same material, and ultimately to those of brick or stone,—clay for making the former being almost everywhere to be had. The houses of the principal streets of York are passing from wood to brick, and in no place, during my tour, did I see more brick erections going forward.",

It enjoys a considerable trade, which is likely to be greatly augmented by the opening of the Rideau canal, which here enters the lake. We examined the barracks, most substantial erections, also the fort and naval yard; the former is renewing with the best materials; the vessels in the docks are hastening to decay. Regarding war in every case an evil, and its engines too often misapplied, the rotting vessels excited more pleasing ideas than the rising fort.",

Steam-boats also touch in passing from Chippaway to Sandwich and Chatham. Kettle creek is a small stream running in a deep channel, the banks being clay, and nearly 200 feet high at its mouth on the shores of the lake, from the bosom of which we saw the moon rise majestically, while examining the banks. On Kettle creek there is a carding, grist, and saw-mill, a distillery and brewery, situated between St Thomas and Port Stanley.",

There are Catholic, Episcopalian, and Presbyterian places of worship, besides schools, and the population is about 500. Most of the inhabitants are of French descent. Trade is very limited, and thought to be declining. Every vessel passing up and down the Detroit comes within 100 yards of the pier, which is at all times accessible to the largest class. Fort Maldon, a paltry mud erection, is situated on the banks of the Detroit, about half a mile from the village, and the military reserve around the fort, which is the best of pasturage, is occupied as common. Amherstburgh is one of the oldest places in Canada, situated in its finest climate, the best British port on Lake Erie, and in beauty and healthiness of situation, inferior to no place in America; yet every thing, with exception of two handsome residences below the town, seems in a state of listless decay. I have no doubt there are better days in store for Amherstburgh.",

This place will soon eclipse Sandwich, and may rival Chatham. Detroit is the great market of Western Canada, and the ferry possesses advantages, in proximity and access during winter, above every other situation. Since leaving Montreal, I had seen no place bearing the marks of age and wealth, and the town of Detroit, situated on the magnificent river of the same name, ranks next to that city in appearance; and in recalling old-country associations, forms a striking contrast to the poverty and lifelessness of Amherstburgh and Sandwich, on the opposite side of the river. Lofty spires and large brick buildings are seen in the distance; steam-vessels, and enginestalks, employed in manufactures, on a near approach. A fine large steam-boat leaves Detroit daily for Buffalo, and smaller ones for less distant places on the north and south. Now and then a steam boat plys to Chicago and other places on Lake Michigan, and in course of a year or two it is probable there will be a daily line of boats. There are three streets running parallel to the river, and many at right angles. The houses in the principal streets are of brick. The population exceeds 3000 souls, the greater part of whom are of French descent.",

    "Description":"Chicago is situated on Lake Michigan, at the confluence of Chicago river, a small stream, affording the advantages of a canal to the inhabitants for a limited distance. At the mouth of the river is Fort-Dearborn, garrisoned by a few soldiers, and one of the places which has been long held to keep the Indian tribes in awe. The entrance from the lake to the river is much obstructed by sand banks, and an attempt is making to improve the navigation. Chicago consists of about 150 wood houses, placed irregularly on both sides of the river, over which there is a bridge. This is already a place of considerable trade, supplying salt, tea, coffee, sugar, and clothing to a large tract of country to the south and west; and when connected with the navigable point of the river Illinois, by a canal or railway, cannot fail of rising to importance. Almost every person I met regarded Chicago as the germ of an immense city, and speculators have already bought up, at high prices, all the buildingground in the neighbourhood. Chicago will, in all probability, attain considerable size, but its situation is not so favourable to growth as many other places in the Union. The country south and west of Chicago has a channel of trade to the south by New Orleans; and the navigation from Buffalo by Lake Huron is of such length, that perhaps the produce of the country to the south of Chicago will find an outlet to Lake Erie by the waters of the rivers Wabash and Mamee. A canal has been in progress for three years, connecting the Wabash and Mamee, which flows into the west end of Lake Erie; and there can be little difficulty in connecting the Wabash with the Illinois, which, if effected, will materially check the rise of Chicago. At the time of visiting Chicago, there was a treaty in progress with the Pottowatamy Indians, and it was supposed nearly 8000 Indians, of all ages, belonging to different tribes, were assembled on the occasion, a treaty being considered a kind of general merry-making, which lasts several weeks; and animal food, on the present occasion, was served out by the States government. The forests and prairies in the neighbourhood were studded with the tents of the Indians, and numerous herds of horses were browsing in all directions. Some of the tribes could be distinguished by their peculiarities. The Sauks and Foxes have their heads shaven, with exception of a small tuft of hair on the crown. Their garments seemed to vary according to their circumstances, and not to their tribes. The dress of the squawswas generally blue cloth, and sometimes printed cotton, with ornaments in the ears, and occasionally also in the nose. The men generally wore white blankets, with a piece of blue cloth round their loins; and the poorest of them had no other covering, their arms, legs, and feet being exposed in nakedness. A few of them had cotton trowsers, and jackets of rich patterns, loosely flowing, secured with a sash; boots, and handkerchiefs or bands of cotton, with feathers in the head-dress, their appearance reminding me of the costume of some Asiatic nations. The men are generally without beards, but in one or two instances I saw tufts of hair on the chin, which seemed to be kept with care, and this was conspicuously so amongst the well-dressed portion. The countenances of both sexes were frequently bedaubed with paint of different kinds, including red, blue, and white.",

Its situation is sufficiently elevated above the river, the banks of which are limestone. There is a row of stores fronting the river, built of stone, and the town consists chiefly of two streets of brick-houses, running parallel to the river, the outskirts being mean wooden houses. This is a place of extensive trade, being the chief depot of lead, which is furnished in vast quantities by the states of Illinois and Missouri. Grist-mills and other machinery are propelled by steam. I counted sixteen steam-boats on the river, exclusive of one plying as a ferry-boat. The city was founded by the French in 1764, and about one-third of the inhabitants are their descendants. The American population now preponderates, but there are numbers of all nations, including many Spaniards. It is the chief place of wealth and trade on the Mississippi, with exception of New Orleans, and may justly be considered the metropolis of the valley of the Mississippi.",

    "Description":"I had time to examine the greater part of the town before dinner, after which I walked to the top of the hills on the east side of the city, and then to the west end. The situation of Cincinnati, as seen from the height, is singularly fine, being in the midst of a circle of hills, through the centre of which the beautiful Ohio flows. The diameter of the circle is about three miles, and the river is not seen beyond the circle. The city is on the north side of the stream, and on the south, or Kentucky side, stand the thriving villages of Newport and Covington, divided by the river Licking, which joins the Ohio. Cincinnati contains about 30,000 inhabitants, the buildings are of brick, and many streets run parallel and at right angles with the river. I found the market plentifully supplied with every commodity, in stalls and waggons, and the bustle and activity of the place was much greater than I expected to find in a city so remotely situated. The streets were clean at the time of my visit, and the general appearance of the place indicated considerable advancement in luxury. Coals sell at ten cents, wheat at fifty-six, Indian corn at twenty-five, and oats at twenty-two cents per bushel...Cincinnati is generally said to be in a declining state, but I could not discover evidence of decay. Houses were building, and bricks manufacturing in all directions. Streets and roads were undergoing extensive improvement in and around the city, while villas were being erected on the surrounding heights. The ship yards were full of bustle, and craft of various kinds were rising into existence. At the close of the year 1832, one hundred and thirty steam-boats had been built at Cincinnati. The city is built on the site of some Indian tumuli, one of which I saw, near the western extremity, in tolerable preservation. I hope the inhabitants will protect this monument of a former race, by enclosing it with an iron railing, and adorning the foreground with flowers. I attended the theatre in the evening. Amongst the players were Sinclair, Thorne, Mrs Knight, and Miss Clara Fisher. The audience were numerous, and somewhat noisy in their plaudits. The agriculture, seen from the waters of the Mississippi and Ohio, is very limited, and which I cannot well describe. Cultivation becomes extended on approaching Cincinnati, and fields of wheat were seen on the sloping banks. The hills, three or four hundred feet high, which I ascended, to the east of the city, were covered with verdant pasturage of grasses and clovers, on which excellent cattle and sheep were browsing. Waggon loads of pumpkins were passing into the town, and I observed many working oxen eating this vegetable in courts.",

    "Description":"Much is doubtless to be attributed to the extreme mellowness and transparency of the atmosphere, which gives colour to every object on land or water. In this, the climate of New York is truly Italian. There is a freshness in the verdure that covers the sloping and gentle shores, a harmony in the outlines,—and above all, there is a life in the aquatic scenery, which I never witnessed elsewhere in an equal degree. An air of gaiety and festal enjoyment, which contrasts singularly with the unholiday appearance of men and things in the interior of the country, reigns on the waters of the bays and rivers in the vicinity of the cities to a surprising degree. At all times of the tide, at every hour of the day, whatever may be the wind, the Bay and its outlets appear alive with craft and shipping, from the dark mass of the frigate, or line-ofbattle ship, which often lay moored abreast of the city, and the colossal steam-boats hourly seen careering over its surface, to the light skilfully-managed wherry of the Whitehaller.... At New York you pass hours with delight under the trees on that beautiful breezy promenade, which the good taste of the citizens has preserved at the extreme point of their island. You follow the example of more illustrious travellers in doing justice to the ample tables of your hotel or friends, not forgetting to pass judgment on rock fish, American oysters, and above all, on shad-fish, if in season. You enjoy many a stroll along the gay and cheerful pavement of Broadway, the principal street, running for miles through the heart of the city, with its handsome edifices, shops, and public buildings. You admire the commodious disposition of the interior of family mansions, with their foldingdoors, clean, cool, indian-matted floors, and the groups of pretty faces by which they are adorned. You marvel at the incessant bustle and proofs of flourishing commerce visible in all the narrower streets devoted to business, diverging right and left towards the North and East rivers; and on the crowded slips and wharfs. You step into a steam-boat, and cross over to Brooklyn, or to the Jersey shore, where you may immediately bury yourself in the delicious walks of Hoboken, where 27 the squirrel climbs as free, and apparently as undisturbed among the grape-vines, as in the depths of the forest. You glance up the Hudson, which laves the grassy margin of the promenade, and see him walled in by the perpendicular pallisadoes and green shores of Manhatten Island, covered with sloops and steamers—and own that in your brightest moment of fancy, you never dreamed of the creation of an equally glorious river, or a city whose position is more strongly marked by all those characteristics which are desirable in a great commercial emporium. Returning, you hear the cry of fire, and repair to the scene of disaster, but go home disappointed, because you find that the good people of New York never give a fire a fair chance, but knock down the house to preserve it from the flames. You walk out on a Sunday evening, and are fairly elbowed into the gutter by the broad-spread bonnets and gigot de mouton of the sable beauties, who, with their beaux, have then the possession of the pavement.",

You welcome a southern climate in the perfume of many odorous flowers, and, more than all, the delightful society for which Maryland is pre-eminent—frank, polished, and unaffected.",

    "Description":"At Harper's Ferry, where the two combined streams before mentioned, have apparently burst their way through the Blue Bridge, as the advanced chain of the many parallel and continuous ridges of the Apallachian series is called, the scenery is deservedly termed romantic. The precipitous and wooded acclivities of the mountains overhang the wide beds of two noble streams, both interrupted by a long chains of rapids. The picturesque village is situated at the point of junction at the foot of a steep acclivity. A long wooden bridge, resting on stone piers, traverses the united volume of water immediately below, and a mile lower down, the whole, roaring over the Bull's Ring rapid, rushes impetuously through the Gap. The scene presented from the crest of the mountain above the village, of the course of the rivers both before and after their junction, is one of the most striking in the United States. The channel of the Shenandoah to the right, appears obstructed by low reefs of slate rock, as far as it is visible, and that of the Potomac to the left, furrowed by rapids and broken by wooded islands. The mountains overhanging both vallies, are rocky and well wooded, and present fine picturesque scenery along the course of the two canals, which have been constructed for the distance of a mile up each for the convenience of the manufactories of carbines and muskets, established here by the General Government, allured by the defensible character of the position, the vicinity of coal, and great ‘water-power.’ The arms furnished by this manufactory, and another in Massachusetts, supply the whole Union. Neatness and economy seem to characterize every department.",

    "Description":"The ascent of the highest summit of the cluster—Mount Washington, (6234 feet) was attempted by our party, under disadvantageous circumstances: upon gaining the summit, after some hour's toil and much expectation, we were enveloped in heavy mist, which set our patience at defiance, and sent us cold and wet on our downward route. A solitary scramble to the summit of the third in rank, situated in the same chain, which I had contrived to accomplish the preceding day, under better auspices, allows me to give you some faint picture of the scenery of the White Hills. As a mountain view, it was truly magnificent, though by far the most gloomy I had ever beheld. The entire group, save five or six of the most elevated mountains, which rear their scalps of micacious rock over a belt of dwarf fir, appears invariably clothed to the very summits with the dense northern forest, and excepting here and there in the deepest vallies, or at such a distance that the gazer could but just detect the difference amidst the blue tints of the horizon, where the swelling surface sank imperceptibly down towards the lower country, the eye was scarcely relieved by the sight of cultivation. No rock could be descried except that which heaped up the highest summits; no bright green pastures were seen on the steep slopes; no white cottages shone like stars from afar; but here and there the precipitous declivities were deeply seamed by tremendous earth-slides, appearing like gashes in the dark face of the mountains. A number of misty lakes gleamed in the distance to the southward, and occasionally you saw the white smoke rising from some upland valley where a hardy son of the soil had pitched his habitation, and began his struggle with the wilderness and its inhabitants.",

    "Description":"We ascended Killington Peak, a prominent summit of the chain, rising four thousand feet above Lake Champlain, which we descried glistening like a sheet of silver in the distant horizon; and we remained one day in the village of Royalton, upon which I will venture a few remarks; partly because we were stationary and more at liberty to look at the scene around us, and partly because of all the pretty New England villages, and there are thousands, there is none more lovely than that just named, on the banks of White River. Too frequently you have to remark, in travelling in the United States, how utterly prosaic all the works of man appear; and it is well if there are exceptions now and then, and if you meet with secluded spots where the charms of nature are not blurred by the inharmonious works of human design. The village in question lay niched in the very heart of the wooded hills on the banks of a crystal stream, flowing over a white pebbly bed, with an occasional mass of slate rock peering above the surface. The hills of medium height, rose steeply on either hand, displaying forested summits and sloping green sides denuded of timber, except occasional groups or single trees, and here and there broken by an isolated mass of rock. A conical hill with a solitary tree on its summit overtopped the lower end of the village. The latter was composed as usual principally of one street, with houses irregularly posted, and trees and gardens between. A few of the modern houses had a degree of taste to recommend them, and an old-fashioned cluster of low cottages with open galleries towards the street, and steps down to the level of the road, directly fronted the inn. The church, barn-like as usual, and built with a scantiness of roof which added to its deformity, stood on the verge of a kind of Green, not far from the inn, which was one of the best and most prominent edifices of the place. It had the ordinary appendage of a huge staring sign and lofty sign-post in the middle of the street. The unoccupied spaces and corners in the immediate vicinity of the houses, which, at an earlier day, had doubtless been heaped with rubbish, now bore a rank growth of tall plants, among which the mulberry-coloured blossoms and broad white leaves of the milk-weed were conspicuous. There were charming walks along the river bank under the shade of the forest, which hung over the water from the northern slopes.",

We found the good citizens of that rising and flourishing city busily ruminating over the first edition of a well-known picture of their domestic manners, which the English press had just sent forth for their especial benefit. Whether the compote was justly and wisely compounded, I was in no way enabled to judge at the time, but it was very evident from the wry faces on all sides, and the aroused spirit of indignation, that the bitter herbs predominated over the sweet. For the rest, such was the crowded state of the only large hotel in the place, two having been burnt in the course of the spring, that we deemed ourselves fortunate to find a speedy opportunity of departure on one of the splendid steam-boats with which the landing place was crowded.",

It lacked, at the time I commemorate, the three last edifices, but was nevertheless a thriving and aspiring place, in its way; and the fortune made here already in the course of its brief existence, by a bold Yankee shopkeeper who had sold sixty thousand dollars' worth of goods here in three years,—was a matter of equal notoriety, surprise, and envy. It is situated about twenty miles east of the Kansas River, and three south of the Missouri, and was consequently very near the extreme western frontier of the State. A little beyond this point, all carriage roads ceased, and one deep black trail alone, which might be seen tending to the southwest, was that of the Santa Fe trappers and traders.",

    "Description":"I was aware that the hills that encompassed this city were filled with bituminous coal, and that one great source of its wealth and prosperity were the factories moved by steam power which could be employed with great effect and cheapness, in consequence of the abundance of this coal. I was also aware that this article constituted the principal fuel which warmed their houses. I therefore expected to see a smoky city , but I was not prepared to see what actually, at first sight, burst upon my view—a vast cloud of smoke rolling up in ten thousand dark columns, and forming a dense, murky canopy, that hung in expanded blackness over the whole town. The city seemed in its sooty and blackened houses, and in its columns of everlasting smoke, like one vast and extended group of furnaces or glass factories. As I continued to gaze upon it, I was reminded of the smoke that went up from the plain of Sodom the morning after the destruction of that city, “when Abraham gat up early and looked over the whole plain.” Our nearer approach to the city did not relieve me from my first impression. Every object and scene, every house and building within the purlieus of the town seemed stained, soiled, and tarnished with the sooty vapour that was ceaselessly ascending from its ten thousand chimneys. Like the frogs of Egypt this dreadful smoke came up into their houses, and there was no escape from it. The walls of the most elegant drawing-rooms bore evidence that the discolouring element had found its way there. The atmosphere every where seemed impregnated with it. I raised the window in my chamber, and the room was almost instantly filled with smoke. Almost as soon as I reached the church on Sunday evening, the doors and windows being open for the admission of air, I perceived the church was filled with a cloud of smoke. Surely Pittsburg is a smoky city. I ask the pardon of its inhabitants for this doleful description. The town certainly bears marks of great thrift and prosperity, and its inhabitants do not lack in sterling excellencies of character. I should be very ungrateful if I did not here record the acknowledgement of the many acts of kindness and hospitality that were extended to me during my temporary stay. In the manner in which the people regarded the unpleasant appendage connected with Pittsburg to which I have just adverted, I saw another evidence of the benevolence and wisdom of the Creator in constituting us with capabilities of adapting ourselves to whatever is around us. The smoky atmosphere, so far from being an annoyance to the citizens of Pittsburg, is constantly spoken of by them as its beauty and glory, and seems associated in their minds with all the delights and interest of home. I have visited the environs of the city, and clambered to the summit of some of the hills out of which the coal is dug. The views from these elevations up the Alleghany and the Monongahela are beautiful. The scenery in every direction around Pittsburg, viewed from these eminences, would be magnificent, were it not for that unchanging cloud of smoke that covers the city as a canopy of darkness.",

Upon the whole I have been greatly pleased with Cincinnati. The whole air and aspect of the town has reminded me more of Philadelphia than any city I have seen west of the mountains. Christ Church, in this city, is a noble building, and the interior furnishes a beautiful specimen of architectural taste and skill. St. Paul's Church is also a tasteful structure, although I was not able to obtain a view of the interior. The Roman Catholic cathedral and college make a fine appearance, but the interior of the cathedral greatly disappointed me. The audience room is small, narrow, and mean in appearance. I am happy to say that in passing through this western region I find but one impression among well-informed and intelligent men in relation to the growth and progress of popery here; and that is, that it is making little or no advances, except with the increase of foreign population.",

    "Description":"Indiana is unquestionably destined to become one of the most interesting of the Western States. Its principal towns that stand along on the Ohio, must of course become very important points. This will be particularly the case with New Albany, which is already one of the most populous and flourishing towns in Indiana. It bears on every part of it the marks of a new place, and the manner in which every house and shed within its precincts is crowded, shows that it must have expansion. It is situated about four miles from Louisville, just below the rapids, on a fine broad table of land, which is so far above high water mark, as effectually to secure it from those inundations, occassioned by the sudden rise of the Ohio. Some way back in the rear of the town, and nearly encircling it, rises up in a very picturesque manner, what is here called a knob, an elevated steppe of land, from which we look down upon the town and river, and see them spread out before us as on a map, in distinct and beautiful delineation. Louisville appears in the distance, and the adjacent country, which with the windings, and wooded scenery of the beautiful Ohio, presents a view so exquisite, that the imagination can scarcely conceive any thing more romantic. It is only three or four years since there were but a handful of inhabitants at New Albany: it now numbers six thousand, and is rapidly increasing in population. A very large proportion of its inhabitants are young, enterprising men from the East, who possess moderate means, and have come here to build up their fortunes.",

The town itself, like all the French villages that we have seen on this river, appeared old and dilapidated, and quite destitute of every thing like improvement, or enterprise. I could not but contrast these French villages, in the midst of this rich luxuriant land, with their little Roman Catholic chapels, their low narrow houses, and abundant marks of poverty, with the neat, tidy, thriving villages of New England, which, although they rear their heads from a hard rocky soil, where industry has to be taxed to the utmost to obtain the means of subsistence, present—in their beautiful church edifices—their elegant public buildings, and well constructed private residences—marks of thrift, industry, and comfort, which cannot fail to gladden the heart of the traveller who passes through them.

    "Description":"This, unquestionably is destined in time to become THE GREAT CITY OF THE WEST [sic]. Its location is pleasant, and from the manner in which the upper part of the city is now building, I should think it would ultimately compete in regularity and beauty with almost any city in the Union. Its most prominent public buildings at present are the theatre and the Roman cathedral. One of the priests politely showed us through the latter building. The interior would be very grand and imposing, were it not for the gaudy paintings, intended as scriptural illustrations, suspended around the audience room. However much these may catch the attention and awaken the admiration of the ignobile vulgus , they cannot fail to excite any thing but complacency in minds accustomed to the more chaste productions of the pencil. In entering the church, we passed through the basement, where are the confessional boxes and a small 89 altar, on which wax candles were burning. Here we saw one of the sisters of charity, sitting in black vestments, in a solitary dusky nook, as though absorbed in holy meditation. In the church we found another priest, engaged, as far as we could understand, in preparing a class of German boys for confirmation. I learned from an intelligent source that Romanism is making little or no progress among Protestants at St. Louis. They have found it necessary to cut off, or conceal many of its offensive excrescences, so that a friend remarked to me, that he thought that a reformation in spite of themselves, silent and gradual, was going on in the Roman Catholic Church. The fact is, that the great difficulty at St. Louis is, that the mass of the people “care for none of these things.” They are equally indifferent to every form of religion.....One thing struck me as remarkable at the West, and particularly at St. Louis. I refer to the appearance of the heavens at sunset. Nothing can exceed the richness and splendour of a western sunset. I have heard much of an Italian sky, but my imagination never conceived such pictures of beauty and indescribable glory, as are painted on the sky here at the decline of day. The whole hemisphere seems flooded with unearthly radience. The clouds piled up the western sky, appear more brilliant and gorgeous than any or all the colours of earth can make them. And as you look at them, you see, through the clouds, apertures, which seem like golden vistas, through which you look almost into the heaven of heavens.",

It was in reference to the section of country just around here, that the Black Hawk war took its rise, and all along above was the scene where it raged. I do not wonder that the Indians gave up this tract of country with reluctance. The eye never looked out upon a more beautiful land—the imagination in its most romantic flight never conceived any thing more lovely. On the Iowa side, especially, the country sweeps off from the shore most beautifully in the form of a rolling prairie, covered here and there with small clusters of trees, that give it the aspect and loveliness of a region that had been under the highest cultivation for the last three centuries.

The town is built at the base and on the side of the western ridge, which is here quite precipitous. The valley itself is overflown with every rise of the Mississippi above this point. The waters of the Fevre River between Galena and its junction with the “Father of rivers” are very sluggish—so that the waters of the Mississippi flow up to Galena often three or four times a year, and flood the whole lower part of the town. Since I have been here the third rise which they have had this season occurred, occasioned as it was supposed by the melting of the snows and ice around the sources of the most northern tributaries of the Mississippi. One thing is very remarkable in relation to the whole class of western tributaries to this stream. The freshets to which they are subject, all occur at different seasons, beginning with the southernmost and ending with the most northerly. This is accounted for by the fact, that, as these streams take their rise at different points of latitude in the Rocky Mountains, spring and summer reach the source of each of them in regular progression from south to north, by a few weeks later. This is a most merciful provision: for if the freshets in two or three of these streams were to happen at the same time, the effects would be desolating. Let the Red River, the Arkansas, and the Missouri, pour their swollen streams at the time of their annual freshets, together into the Mississippi, and the whole lower regions for hundreds of miles above and around New Orleans would be one unbroken sea. What a tremendous armament of destruction has the Almighty here! Have not the inhabitants of that city which has seated herself, as a queen at the mouth of this river, reason to remember that the Lord can bury them in a moment in the midst of the sea? He has only to blow with his wind, and the waters will flow, and the depths cover them! Let those who openly and remorselessly trample on every law of God consider this and tremble. Galena is by no means a pleasant town. There are some situations on the hills which environ it that would furnish delightful sites for residences, but at present these 10 are chiefly unoccupied. The streets of this place are nar. row, and after a rain unspeakably muddy. The houses are small, poor, and crowded. There is nothing interesting or attractive about the appearance of the town, except in a business point of view. Galena is the port where almost all the lead raised from the vast mines scattered through this region is brought to be shipped, and will therefore unquestionably be a place of great importance. Its moral character, I fear, is far from what we could wish it. Like many of these western towns, till recently, there has been scarcely the semblance of a Sabbath here. Drinking, duelling, and gambling, have all been common.—And yet there are many here that wish things were different, and are making some successful efforts to cause them to be so.",

    "Description":"About a dozen miles before we reached Chicago, we seemed to descend to another steppe of land, where the prairie was for the most part from two to twelve inches under water. The grass, thus having its roots continually irrigated, looked very rank; we made but very slow progress through it on our way. Though that part of Chicago which is built up, stands on more elevated ground, the anticipated limits of the city extend into this wet prairie. We saw the lots staked out as we passed, which I suppose have been sold at a very high price. I could not but think of the remark of a fellow traveller, who, in speaking of this and several other places, said, “If each of these places do not become as large as Pekin in China, these city lots cannot all be built upon.” Chicago is truly an interesting place. It has sprung up here in three or four years—a city —as by the wand of enchantment. I had heard much of this place, but must confess I was not prepared to find so large and interesting a town. Its situation on either side of the Chicago river is too well-known to need description. It has quite the air of an eastern town. There is a fine brick Episcopal Church just completed. Our stay was very brief in Chicago. Almost the first sound we heard after our arrival, was the ringing of the bell of the large and beautiful steamboat, James Madison , which was on the eve of departure for Detroit and Buffalo. As we might have no other opportunity of going by the lakes for the next ten days, with the specimen of land travelling that we had just had, we were not long in making up our minds whether we would avail ourselves of this boat, or direct our course to Detroit through the Michigan woods. We gave Chicago a very hasty survey, took our passage on board the James Madison, and as the shades of evening gathered over us we found ourselves skimming over the waves of Michigan lake.",

    "Description":"It was towards evening when we approached this picturesque spot—Mackinaw—where the wide expanse of water, and the dark evergreens of the islands, and the thronging multitudes of wild men, gave to this point in my journey a novel appearance. I think this would be a most delightful retreat for an invalid who wanted retirement, a cool, invigorating atmosphere, and inducements to active exercise. It would be impossible for a man to be here long without having new trains of thought awakened in his mind, or without being led to contemplate the human character under several new aspects. Mackinaw is an island of about nine miles in circumference. There is a fort occupying the elevated parts of the town, which is now vacated, the troops having been withdrawn to be present at the treaty at St. Peter's. This circumstance, in connexion with the great number of Indians now present, has created some uneasiness in the minds of the inhabitants of this place, especially as the Indians are very much dissatisfied with the attempt to palm off on to them goods in part for their annuities, when money had been promised. Already has a council been held among them, and the hint has been dropped that they can bring a thousand warriors into the field. The first object that met my eye on the low pebbly shore, as we approached the island, was the beautiful lodges, and well made bark canoes of the Ottawa and Chippewa tribes. The whole appearance of their encampment in this wild spot is picturesque and imposing. Each family had their bark canoe, which was now drawn up on the beach, and lay beside their lodge or tent. In this canoe, made of the outer rind of the birchen tree, they carry their family, and furniture, and all their worldly effects— children, dogs, fishing-tackle, guns, their tent, cooking utensils, and themselves. Their tent, or lodge, consists first of five or six tapering rods, which are set up so as to form a cone, and then around these are placed a coil of matting, made of reeds or flaggs, and arranged in such a manner as to form a series of concentric or circular covering, each lapping upon the other like the scales upon a fish. In the centre of the lodge a fire was kindled, a hole having been left in the upper part through which the smoke could pass off. Around the fire were spread the blankets and bear-skins, which furnished both beds and seats. We entered several tents and were kindly received.",

The houses in Detroit are generally composed of wood, which are very neatly painted. Several streets running parallel with the river are exceedingly beautiful, especially Jefferson Avenue , which is the Broadway or Chesnut street of Detroit. The Episcopal Church is a very neat gothic building. A second Episcopal Church of a larger size is soon to be erected in another part of the town. The churches and other public buildings in Detroit are certainly highly creditable to the place.",

It has a population of about eight thousand; its houses are generally handsome and well built. It is separated from Ohio City by the Cuyahoga river, a stream into which the steamboats run up, which stop at Cleveland. Ohio City is a pleasant town, having between two and three thousand inhabitants. They are here erecting a fine stone edifice for an Episcopal Church. This place appears to bear the same relation to Cleveland that Brooklyn does to New York. Unhappily there is no small jealousy between the two places, which it is hoped the experience of a few years will cure. Some of the streets in the eastern part of Cleveland, looking off upon the lake, are beautiful beyond the power of description.",

Though the business part of the village is situated principally on the northwest corner of the lake, by far the most beautiful part of the town stretches along on the western bank which rises some fifty or hundred feet above the quiet waters of this beautiful lake. Here a street runs along parallel with the lake, and the most delightful residences are built up on either side. Almost every dwelling has before it a fine court-yard filled with shrubbery and ornamented with flowers. And those built on the brow of the lake have gardens terraced down to the water's edge. The lake is here some three miles wide, stretching off forty miles to the south, and presenting on the opposite side a beautiful and finely-cultivated country. On this street, looking off upon this lovely sheet of water, stands the college. As we recede to the west the land rises by gentle and successive undulations for a mile or two, furnishing on the summit of these successive ridges the most delightful locations for residences, from some of which you have brought within the ken of your eye the whole village and lake, and country beyond. I have already partially described the street that runs along on the western bank of the lake, which is adorned and shaded with trees, and on which the college and principal churches are built. Farther west and running parallel with this is another street inferior in beauty, but peculiarly attractive to me, as at its northern extremity is situated the old burying ground, where sleeps the dust of many, many dear friends.",

My temporary stay there was at South Brooklyn, a portion of that enterprising town which has been but recently built up. Scarcely any thing during my tour has more astonished me than the wonderful growth of this place. From a little rural village, it has grown up, in a few years, to a city, which, though it cannot pretend to rival the mighty metropolis that lies spread out in gigantic dimensions on the other side of the river, can still number its thirty or forty thousand inhabitants. One of the causes that have contributed to the rapid growth of this town, is its vicinity to New York. Gentlemen engaged in business in New York, find it pleasant and healthful to have their residences located upon the hills of Brooklyn, which look off upon the beautiful bay, and are daily fanned with fresh breezes from the ocean. While Brooklyn is thus increasing in population, I was happy to find that a corresponding increase was observable in its religious institutions and houses of public worship. The temporary edifice occupied by the congregation of Christ Church, of which our friend the Rev. K. G—is rector, is soon to be abandoned, and a new and beautiful Gothic structure is to be erected for the occupancy of that congregation.",

Some of them in their country villas, where we visited several friends in the neighborhood. The environs of Boston are very agreeable; woods and hills, and bare rocks, and small lakes, and estuaries running far into the land, and lanes with hedges, and abundance of wild flowers.

    "Description":"After sailing up the Kennebec about fifteen miles we came to Bath, a town of 5000 souls, chiefly engaged in ship-building, a branch of industry in which the State of Maine ranks first in the Union; the materials consisting of white oak and pine, the growth of native forests. Large logs of timber squared, and each marked with the owner's name, are often cast into the river, sometimes far above Augusta, and come floating down 100 miles to this place. In winter many of them get frozen into the ice and imprisoned for six or seven months, until the late spring releases them, and then not a few of them are carried far out into the Atlantic, where they have been picked up, with the owner's name still telling the place of their origin. The water is salt as far as Bath, above which it is fresh and freezes over, so as to allow sleighs and skaters to cross it in winter, although the influence of the tide extends as far up as Augusta, about forty miles above Bath. I am informed that the whole body of the ice rises and falls, cracking along the edges where it is weakest. Over the fissures planks are placed to serve as a bridge, or snow is thrown in, which freezes, and affords a passage to the central ice. The Kennebec, besides being enlivened by the “lumber trade,” is at this season whitened with the sails of vessels laden with hay, which has been compressed into small bulk by the power of steam. Many of these merchantmen are destined for New York, where the unusual heat and drought of the summer has caused a scanty crop of grass, but hundreds are bound to the distant ports of Mobile and New Orleans; so that the horses of Alabama and Louisiana are made to graze on the sweet pastures of Maine, instead of the coarser and ranker herbage of the southern prairies. In a few months these northern-built ships will bring back bales of cotton for factories newly established by Boston capitalists, and worked on this river both by water power and steam. Such are the happy consequences of the annexation of Louisiana to the United States. But for that event, the favorite theories of political economy in New England, and the duty of protecting native industry, would have interposed many a custom-house and high tariff between Maine and the valley of the Mississippi.",

    "Description":"We admired the fine avenues of drooping elms in the streets of Plymouth as we entered, and went to a small old-fashioned inn called the Pilgrim House, where I hired a carriage, in which the landlord drove us at once to see the bay and visit Plymouth beach. This singular bar of sand, three miles long, runs across part of the bay directly opposite the town, and, two miles distant from it, serving as a breakwater to the port; in spite of which the sea has been making great inroads, and might have swept away all the wharves but for this protection. As the bar was fast wasting away, the Federal Government employed engineers to erect a wooden framework, secured with piles, a mile long, which has been filled with stones, and which has caused an accumulation of sand to take place. This beach reminded me of the bar of Hurst Castle, in Hampshire; and in both cases a stream enters the bay where the beach joins the land. It is well known that the Plymouth bar was a narrow neck of land eighty years ago; and one of the inhabitants told me that when a boy he had gathered nuts, wild grapes, and plums there. Even fifty years ago some stumps of trees were still remaining, whereas nothing now can be seen but a swamp, a sea-beach, and some shoals adjoining them....But they who visit the town for the sake of old associations, will not complain of the antique style of many of the buildings, and the low rooms with paneled walls, and huge wooden beams projecting from the ceilings, such as I never saw elsewhere in America. Some houses built of brick brought from Holland, notwithstanding the abundance of brick-earth in the neighborhood, were pointed out to us in Leyden-street, so called from the last town in Europe where the pilgrims sojourned after they had been driven out of their native country by religious persecution. In some private houses we were interested in many venerated heir-looms, kept as relics of the first settlers, and among others an antique chair of carved wood, which came over in the Mayflower, and still retains the marks of the staples which fixed it to the floor of the cabin. This, together with a seal of Governor Winslow, was shown me by an elderly lady, Mrs. Haywood, daughter of a Winslow and a White, and who received them from her grandmother. In a public building, called Pilgrim Hall, we saw other memorials of the same kind; as, for example, a chest or cabinet, which had belonged to Peregrine White, the first child born in the colony, and which came to him from his mother, and had been preserved to the fifth generation in the same family, when it was presented by them to the Museum. By the side of it was a pewter dish, also given by the White family. In the same collection, they have a chair brought over in the Mayflower, and the helmet of King Philip, the Indian chief, with whom the first settlers had many a desperate fight. A huge fragment of granite, a boulder which lay sunk in the beach, has always been traditionally declared to have been the exact spot which the feet of the Pilgrims first trod when they landed here; and part of this same rock still remains on the wharf, while another portion has been removed to the center of the town, and inclosed within an iron railing, on which the names of forty-two of the Pilgrim Fathers are inscribed.",

    "Description":"As we sailed out of the harbor, which was crowded with vessels, we saw all the ropes of their riggings similarly adorned with crystals of ice A stormy voyage of nine hours carried us through Long Island Sound, a distance of ninety miles, to New York. It is only three years since we were last in this city, yet in this short interval we see improvements equaling in importance the increase of the population, which now amounts in round numbers to 440,000; New York containing 361,000, and Brooklyn, which is connected with it by a ferry, together with Williamsburg 79,000. Among other novelties since 1841, we observe with pleasure the new fountains in the midst of the city supplied from the Croton waterworks, finer than any which I remember to have seen in the center of a city since I was last in Rome. Two of them are now, in spite of an intense frost, throwing up columns of water more than thirty feet high, one opposite the City Hall, and another in Hudson Square; but I am told that when we return in the summer we shall see many others in action. A work more akin in magnificence to the ancient and modern Roman aqueducts has not been achieved in our times; the water having been brought from the Croton river, a distance of about forty miles, at the expense of about three millions sterling. The health of the city is said to have already gained by greater cleanliness and more wholesome water for drinking; and I hear from an eminent physician that statistical tables show that cases of infantine cholera and some other complaints have sensibly lessened....Among the new features of the city we see several fine churches, some built from their foundations, others finished since 1841. The wooden spires of several are elegant, and so solid, as to have all the outward effect of stone. The two most conspicuous of the new edifices are Episcopalian, Trinity and Grace Church. The cost of the former has been chiefly defrayed by funds derived from the rent of houses in New York, bequeathed long since to the Episcopal Church. The expense is said to have equaled that of erecting any four other churches in the city. It is entirely of stone, a fine-grained sandstone of an agreeable light-brown tint. The top of the steeple is 289 feet from the ground. The effect of the Gothic architecture is very fine, and the Episcopalians may now boast that of all the ecclesiastical edifices of this continent, they have erected the most beautiful. Its position is admirably chosen, as it forms a prominent feature in Broadway, the principal street, and in another direction looks down Wallstreet, the great center of city business.",

The view of the city and the river Potomac from the hill on which the Capitol stands is fine; but, in spite of some new public edifices built in a handsome style of Greek architecture, we are struck with the small progress made in three years since we were last here. The vacant spaces are not filling up with private houses, according to the original plan, so that the would-be metropolis wears still the air of some projector's scheme which has failed. The principal hotels, however, have improved, and we were not annoyed, as when last here, by the odors left in the room by the colored domestics, who, had no beds, but slept any where about the stairs or passages, without changing their clothes.

A lady told me that, when the conflagration burst forth very suddenly, she was with a merchant whose house was not insured, and, finding him panic struck, and incapable of acting for himself, she had selected his ledgers and other valuables, and was carrying them away to her own house; but on the way the civic guard stopped her in the dark, and, suspecting her to be a person of color, required her to show her pass. She mentioned this incidentally, as a serious cause of delay when time was precious; but it brought home forcibly to our minds the extraordinary precautions which one half the population here think it necessary to take against the other half. A large export of turpentine is the chief business of this port, and gashes are seen cut in the bark of the pines in the neighboring forest, from which resin exudes. The half decayed wood of these resinous pines forms what is called light wood, burning with a most brilliant flame, and often used for candles, as well as for reviving the fire. A North Carolinian is said to migrate most unwillingly to any new region where this prime luxury of life is wanting.",

    "Description":"Almost all the best houses in Charleston are built with verandahs, and surrounded with gardens. In some of the streets we admired the beautiful evergreens, and remarked among them the Prunus virginiana , with black cherries hanging to it, and Magnolia grandiflora. The number of turkey buzzards is surprising. I have seen nine of them perched side by side, like so many bronze statues, breaking the long line of a roof in the clear blue sky, while others were soaring in the air, each feather, at the extremity of their extended wings, being spread out, so as to be seen separate from the rest. A New England friend, whom we met here, seeing my interest in these birds, told me they are the sole scavengers of the place, and a fine of five dollars is imposed on any person who kills one...I was surprised, when sailing out of the beautiful harbor of Charleston, on a bright scorching day, to see a cloud of smoke hanging over the town, and learned that they burn here not a little of what is called Liverpool coal. Among others on board, was a female passenger from\n one of the western states, who, having heard me make inquiries for my wife, went up to her in the ladies' cabin and said, “Your old man is mighty eager to see you;” “old man,” as we afterward found, being synonymous with husband in the West. We were to go by the inland navigation, or between the islands and the coast. After passing Edisto Point, we ran aground at the entrance of St. Helena's Sound, in mid-passage, and were detained some hours till the tide floated us off to the westward, through the winding mazes of a most intricate channel, called the Beaufort River. We passed between low sandy islands, and an equally low mainland, covered with evergreen oaks, and long-leaved pines and palmettos, six or seven feet high. Sometimes we sailed by a low bluff or cliff of white sand, two or three feet in height, then by a cotton plantation, then by large salt marshes covered with reeds, on which the cattle are supported when fodder is scarce in winter. The salt water in this narrow channel was as calm as a lake, and perfectly clear. Numerous wild ducks were diving as our steamboat approached, and beds of oysters were uncovered between high and low water mark.",

    "Description":"Savannah has a population of 12,000 souls, but seems rather stationary, though some new buildings are rising. The mildness of its climate is attributed partly to the distance to which the Alleghany Mountains retire from the sea coast in this latitude, and partly to the proximity of the Gulf-stream. But many of the northern invalids, who are consumptive, and had hoped to escape a winter by taking refuge in this city, are complaining of the frost, and say that the houses are inadequately protected against cold. The sun is very powerful at mid-day, and we see the Camellia Japonica in the gardens flowering in the open air; but the leaves of the orange trees look crisp and frost-bitten, and I am told that the thermometer lately fell as low as 17° Fahr., so that even the salt water froze over in some of the marshes. While at Savannah I made a delightful excursion, in company with Dr. Le Conte, Captain Alexander, and Mr. Hodgson, to Skiddaway, one of the sea-islands, which may be said to form part of a great delta on the coast of Georgia, between the mouths of the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers. This alluvial region consists of a wide extent of low land elevated a few feet above high water, and intersected by numerous creeks and swamps. I gave some account in my former tour of my visit to Heyner's Bridge, where the bones of the extinct mastodon and mylodon were found. Skiddaway is five or six miles farther from Savannah in the same southeast direction, and is classical ground for the geologist, for, on its northwest end, where there is a low cliff from two to six feet in height, no less than three skeletons of the huge Meggatherium have been dug up, besides the remains of the Mylodon, Elephas primigenius, Mastodon giganteu , and a species of the ox tribe.",

Broadway was too narrow to square with my preconceived notions, and its enormous length reminded me of a wounded snake. It is a perfect Alexandrine in street-making. The Battery, however, is really a beautiful promenade. Washington Square presents two sides of imposing appearance. Hudson Square, with its centre place of massive branching trees, is very handsome; and there are several points of view worthy of a city of 500,000 souls. But its position between two rivers is too cramped to give sufficient verge on either side for the improvements which are called for by its increasing population and wealth. The public buildings are not remarkable, with the exception of the Exchange and the Custom House (both in course of erection when I first arrived), and they are absolutely lost in the confined space of one rather indifferent street, although they are edifices that should stand respectively in extensive areas, and to be rightly seen, should have been placed on some elevated spot, neither obstructed by crowds, nor hidden by intrusive houses.",

    "Description":"Independent of these claims to my personal regard, Boston possessed many attractive peculiarities; it is not only famous from its association with the early struggles of the American Revolution, but a superiority over the other cities of the Union seems to be generally conceded to the refinement of its society and the literary taste of its inhabitants. It is known as the birth-place of Franklin, and, in modern days, as the head quarters of the North American Review, the only transatlantic periodical which is at all recognised, or I might say at all known, in England....The first appearance of Boston is calculated to make a most favourable impression. It is well-built, clean, and bearing evidence of increasing embellishment in every quarter. It is far more English-looking than New York. It has no long avenue, like Broadway, planted with trees and shaded with awnings, to remind you of the Paris Boulevards; nor are there rows of painted houses by a river side, to bring up the recollection of some Dutch scene. The plan of Boston is very irregular, like the formation of the ground it is built on. There are bits of great beauty to be selected in various of the street views; and I think the “Common,” the homely appellation of a handsomely planted park of sixty acres extent, with the streets which look upon it at three sides, and the view of the sea and distant hilly country covered with villages, is altogether one of the finest things of its kind which I had ever seen. At the other extremity of the town is a series of wharves and quays, of most solid and imposing construction. The warehouses (here called stores), mainly built of granite, with their large windows, thanks to the absence of any tax on the light of heaven, look like long lines of splendid dwellings, and only require porticos and colonnades to have the air of so many palaces. A quantity of shipping mix their tall masts with these handsome erections. The public buildings scattered through the town are not remarkable, except in general for the economical tone of their structure, and in some instances for the extreme bad taste of their style. The new Custom-house, just begun at the time of my arrival, and the Exchange, long afterwards commenced and quickly finished, are exceptions. The former, in spite of some architectural defects, is a handsome ornament to the city; the latter is a plain, but striking feature in State Street, the main place of business, of which its façade, with six fine granite pilasters, is the chief object of observation. But it is not from any point within the city that it appears really what it is—the flourishing capital of a populous extent of country. To see it aright you must ascend the neighbouring heights of Roxbury, Dorchester, or Bunker's Hill; whence its dimensions, with those of the suburb villages in its immediate vicinity, seem joined in one immense mass of habitations, intermixed with spires and domes, stretching far into the land, and lining the sea-shore for several miles.",

    "Description":"My admiration of its fine position, the vastness of its plan, and the progress of its filling up, was probably greater than it would have been, had I come there without any preconceived notions. To my view Washington was a grand conception, imperfectly carried out, but by no means the absurd abortion it is generally represented. I will not attempt descriptions of its edifices, or a measurement of its length and breadth. Its then population of 20,000, or thereabouts, had certainly space and verge enough; and its politicians cannot complain of want of room. The Capitol is a noble structure. I can imagine no one so fastidious as not to be delighted at the prospect from its terrace. Others of the public buildings—the Treasury, the Patent Office, the Post Office in particular—are worthy of any city in Europe. But I am convinced that one feeling mixed with every glance of observation which I cast around me, of a nature so powerful as to imbue everything with its colouring. I could not help imagining that the place, in all its vastness, was filled with the spirit of its immortal founder. Everything in Washington was to me impressed with the image of him whose name it bears. Its whole design was as a monument to him. The unfinished plan, slowly going on towards completion, bore the impress of his large and reflective intellect. It was not a place of mushroom growth, run rapidly up, like the flimsy constructions which overspread the country, but a solid city, founded on a grand scheme, which it may require a century to carry out: a fitting illustration of the powerful and patient mind by which it was conceived and commenced, and which seems still to preside over its gradual advances. Another impression forcibly affected me on occasion of this first visit to Washington, and in a scarcely diminished degree on every following one. This was a sentiment of shame at the recollection of the scenes acted there by the British forces under the command of General Ross, in 1814. If America should become magnanimous enough to forgive, or mean enough to forget them, England at least should remember them for ever. But with deep contrition, and as a warning against similar excesses in future. The destruction by fire of public buildings, the plunder of private houses, are sufficiently revolting, even in a fortress taken by storm after a long resistance. But in an open and undefended town left to the mercy of the assailants, such outrages are the disgrace not the triumph of war. Every English visitor to Washington, whether in official employment, or for passing business, or mere pleasure, should bear those deplorable transactions in mind, and let the pride of superiority over the people he mixes with be tempered, by the thought of what many of them witnessed, and what all must feel. The crimes of one generation are often visited on another; and not unjustly, if that other fails to admit, and does not endeavour to atone for them.",

An avenue of tall cocoanut palms before an unchurchlike Lutheran church was destroyed, the huge and beautiful fronds, being either rent off, or torn into ribbons, hung down in long weepers. Whole streets were blocked up with every kind of furniture, mingled with great stones, fragments of ships, timbers, and branches of trees. The top of one huge barricade was surmounted by half a piano, and a merchant's counting-house displayed a great hole, through which a ship's bowsprit had been driven—much to the discomfiture of the clerk inside—by the great tidal wave which had accompanied the cyclone. In places by the sea-shore huge fires were burning, and beside these, dead bodies were being landed, nailed up in rude chests, and carried off for burial. A local Roman Catholic clergyman, amid the general paralysis, worked gallantly under the burning sun recovering bodies in the harbour. He manned a boat with some of his black sheep , went out with crucifix and holy water, and disputed with the sharks for the possession of the corpses. The air of St. Thomas, as may be supposed, infected with the taint of dead bodies floating in the harbour, or concealed under the ruins, was anything but pleasant or healthy. In fact, St. Thomas is, under any circumstances, little better than a pest-house, and is seldom free from yellow fever.",

This islet belongs to the Dutch, and contains about 1,500 people, mostly belonging to the Anglican Church. The inhabitants bear a good character for industry. They are visited annually by the English Bishop of Antigua, but so great is the difficulty of landing, that his lordship has never effected it without a ducking. There is no resident clergyman, but the Dutch Governor holds 8 some sort of commission from the Anglican Bishop to read the Scriptures, conduct public prayer, and bury the dead. A queer kind of compact exists between the Bishop and the Methodist preachers of St. Eustacius, by which the former binds himself not to visit that island, if the latter keep clear of Saba—a provision rather cruel to the St. Eustacians!",

St. Kitts looks very pretty from the sea. A zone of rich cultivation runs round the island, sloping gradually upwards to a zone of forests, overtopped by the offsets and central peak of the volcanic Mount Misery. We reached St. Kitts a little before sunset, and, going ashore, I had time to explore the ruins of Basseterre, the capital and only town, which had lately been destroyed by fire. Here stood the one fine Anglican church of all the West Indian Islands. The shell alone is left, but this is enough to show that it had been a really noble and striking edifice, solemn, massive, well adapted to the climate, and thoroughly church-like in appearance. The architect was Mr. Christian. It is built of a dark reddish-brown stone, with a massive tower, nave, aisles, and chancel. The bells, stained glass, lectern, and, indeed, all the internal fittings, except a pavement of Minton's tiles, had fallen a prey to. the flames. Almost the only houses which escaped the conflagration were those cut off from the rest by a pretty public garden, where 9 a fountain plashing amidst bowers of sweet roses presented an unexpected, and certainly an un-English and un-Colonial, bit of civilization.

    "Description":"This was Roseau, the capital of Dominica, or Sunday Island, so called by Columbus because he discovered it on the Lord's day. I landed on a rotten quay, half ruined by a great ocean wave coincident with the recent hurricane at St. Thomas's. A rumour of that catastrophe had already reached Dominica by a sailing-craft, and the quay was thronged by crowds of negroes and creoles, all open-eared to hear the news. I was detained nearly half-an-hour giving an account of the scene of destruction I had witnessed; and it was past midnight when I found myself ensconced in bed in a house of entertainment kept by an old black widow, who proved a kind-hearted and obliging person. The house was built of wood, and was not particularly weather-tight, as I found to my cost during a tremendous shower of tropical rain which fell shortly before daybreak, The following morning, however, was fine; and a blazing sun and blue sky set off to advantage the marvellously rich vegetation in which Roseau lies embosomed, and by which, indeed, it is partly overwhelmed. The town, or rather city, for it is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric, presents a curious picture of soft and gentle decay. The island being, in a financial point of view, well nigh ruined, trade has almost entirely deserted the capital. The houses, which are most of them mere wooden shanties , raised a little way from the ground upon stone piles, are either falling or fallen into decay, and the sites of many are overgrown with trees and brushwood. The city was originally well laid out, with straight streets crossing each other at right angles, but, with one or two exceptions, they are now covered with grass, which is kept cropped beautifully short by sheep or goats, which pasture before their owners' doors. At intervals, majestic sandbox and other trees raise their gnarled trunks from the footways. A few general stores and merchants' offices upon the quay, and in one adjacent street, seem to engross all the business of the place: all else, saving only a noisy Methodist meeting-house, is as quiet as Venice. Saving only two venerable gigs, there are no wheeled carriages in the island. A soft melancholy seems to pervade the whole place...The market at Roseau, to turn to more legitimate traffic, is but poorly supplied with fish by reason of the great paucity of boats and fishermen, but fruit is brought in in great variety and abundance. The cookery at my boarding-house was very tolerable, and perhaps better than what could be had at a house of similar pretensions in England: the principal difference being, that instead of Susan's hair, one found Quasheba's wool in the dishes. The situation of the city of Roseau is lovely in the extreme. It occupies the seaward portion of a little triangular plain, the delta of a small river. 14 At one end of the town is a pretty savannah abutting on the public cemetery, and surrounded by dilapidated shanties; at the other end is the river, which, rushing down from a beautiful mountain valley behind, finds its way to the sea between the mahogany legs of numerous negress washerwomen, and over the bodies of squads of happy little blackamoors who lie soaking in the clear sweet water, with their black noses sticking out like so many little sucking hippopotami. A mile up this river I found a most delectable bathing-place, where one can get a header into deep water from a rock, and be carried down by the swift, clear current to a bank of sand below. Half a mile behind the town the hills begin to rise, and swell upwards into lovely peaked mountains, clothed with dense forests to their very summits. Following the river up from the plain, the scenery is of exquisite beauty. The road, constructed of old by the French, but now well-nigh overgrown, keeps alongside and above the stream, which dashes below over a thousand rounded boulders torn from the hills above.",

    "Description":"The wind kept shifting all day, and we were sometimes becalmed; so at length I betook myself to one of the boats along with the captain and two of the crew, and about five arrived at St. Pierre, the commercial capital and largest town in Martinique. Had I come by the steamer I should not have been allowed to land at all, as all communication was cut off from St. Thomas, as an infected port. Abolished in France, the passport system still flourishes in Martinique, and before dinner I was compelled to deposit the passport I had obtained from the governor of Dominica at the bureau of the police. I found tolerably comfortable quarters at the Hôtel des Bains, but the cuisine was far from good. The spécialité was palmice , the centre of the top of a kind of cabbage-palm, an excellent dish, which in colour and flavour somewhat resembles seakale. St. Pierre is a pretty and pleasant town, thoroughly French in character. It stands on a strip of land between the sea, and lofty, and, in some places, almost precipitous, hills, and it partly ascends the lower slopes of the latter. There is a pretty little promenade shaded by tamarind-trees close to the sea, and another higher up is shaded by fine mangroves. There is no regular harbour, but the bay affords a tolerably safe anchorage. The trade is considerable. The streets are well laid out and contain fairly good shops. There is generally an air of quiet respectability and homeliness about the whole place which is very pleasing. A small theatre is occasionally open, and the young men have an excellent amateur musical society. Water is abundant, streams of it conducted from the mountains running rapidly through every street, and occasionally jetting up in fountains. At one end of the town a swift torrent finds its way to the sea. Above, in a lofty and beautiful situation, stands the College, where a large number of the boys and young men of Martinique and Guadaloupe receive their education. This institution appears to be in excellent order and flourishing condition. It contains a small museum, a pleasant garden, and a splendid swimming, bath, which the pupils appeared to enjoy amazingly....The view from the signal-station on the lofty hill above St. Pierre is rich and beautiful beyond description, and the scenery altogether justifies the title which the French have applied to Martinique of the “Queen of the Antilles.” A small steamer plies between St. Pierre, the commercial capital, and Port de France, the military capital and seat of Government, and performs the voyage in about a couple of hours. The coast all the way is very pretty, the eye sweeping over snug shingle-roofed villages, peeping out from dense groves of cocoa-nut palms, to the lofty “Pitons” or sugar-loaf mountain peaks above. The rocks in places form precipices, which exhibit their volcanic origin.",

    "Description":"Port de France is situated in a wide and deep bay, extending far into the land, and forming a magnificent anchorage. The harbour, in fact, is unrivalled in the Antilles. It is astonishing that England should have restored Martinique to France, seeing that it lies immediately between Dominica and St. Lucia, islands of less value, which she retained. It would be invaluable in time of peace as a packetstation, and in time of war as a rendezvous for the Queen's ships. The great fort presents a very imposing aspect from the sea, but, with the present calibre of artillery, would probably not be near so formidable as an entrenched earth-work citadel upon a lofty hill about a mile inland. The streets of the town are laid out at right angles to each other, and are clean and well watered with runnels upon either side, but they have somewhat of a deserted look. At one end of the town is the Savane , which is to Port de France what the Champs Elysées are to Paris, or the Esbeykeyeh to Cairo. It is a large and beautiful public promenade, shaded by grand trees, open to the sea in two directions, and commanding a lovely view inland of the forest-clad peaks of the “Pitons.” In the centre stands a fair white marble statue of unhappy Josephine, a native of Martinique. She is represented looking across the lovely bay to her quiet birthplace amongst the green cane-fields, and holds in her hand a medallion of her base betrayer, Napoleon le Grand. Twice a week the Savane is enlivened by a military band, when a good opportunity is afforded of seeing some of the Martinican belles, who certainly sustain their reputation for uncommon beauty. Round the Savane stand the residences of the Governor and the General, together with the various public offices. Near the military harbour are some magnificent sablier or sandbox trees of surprising height and girth. Hard by is a new and splendid dry dock, large enough to contain vessels of the first-class; and vessels of the Royal Navy and Royal Mail Steam Company are sometimes compelled to avail themselves of its advantages to clean and refit. The harbour generally displays one or two French war-steamers, and some of the packets of the line which plies between St. Nazaire and Cayenne...At the end of the town opposite to the Savane a river joins the sea, and immediately beyond a magnificent fountain of water dashes down the staircased side of a precipitous hill-bank. The stream is brought by a subterraneous aqueduct from the mountains, and rushing forth in great volume from a semi-cupola, tumbles in a succession of waterfalls to the river. This fine work resembles in no small degree the fountain of S. Paolo on the Janiculum at Rome. It is called the “Canal de Gueydon,” having been constructed in 1856 by a Governor-General of that name. The view from the top is lovely, commanding the whole town, the harbour, the bay, Fort St. Louis, and the opposite mountains. Notwithstanding the presence of a small garrison and its being the seat of Government, there is little life stirring in Port de France, but it is a pleasant, civilized little place, and the whole island is apparently far better governed than any of those belonging to the English.",

    "Description":"After a very agreeable visit to Martinique, I proceeded to Barbados, touching en route at St. Lucia, an English island, with which I had afterwards several other opportunities of making acquaintance. On this occasion I had only time to view the capital, Castries, which is prettily, if not very healthily, situated at the end of a bay, which, once entered, affords an excellent and safe anchorage for ships. The town is pretty; but as dull and stagnant as its own ditches. The people generally speak a French patois. The “French” or rather Roman church stands in a shady square, which boasts of a fountain and walks shaded by fine trees. The paltry edifice belonging to the Anglicans stands on a little knoll, which rises from a swamp outside the town. Venomous serpents are so numerous as to preclude the idea of evening services. To minister to the handful of semi-Presbyterianized Anglicans, one of the ablest and best-informed Churchmen in the diocese has been appointed, as to a penal settlement. This is one of the penalties of being “high” without being “dry” in a West Indian diocese! Upon the “Morne,” a mountain high above the town of Castries, is a deserted barrack and the residence of the administrator of the Government. The view from this elevated spot is exquisite in the extreme, and the prospect along the coast reminded me of many scenes in the Riviera between Nice and Genoa. Far off across the flashing strait gleam the distant mountains of Martinique. Behind, all is mountains, with deep valleys between. Peak rises behind peak, and each is fringed to the very summit by the greenest of green forests. The worst of looking at views in St. Lucia is that, in your ardour for the picturesque, you are likely enough to sit down on a snake. Fatal accidents are of continual occurrence. The snakes even enter the precincts of the town, and yet no reward is offered for their destruction.",

    "Description":"Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, occupies the flat shore of a slight indentation in the coast, which is dignified by the name of Carlisle Bay. Seen from the anchorage, with the “villa-built residences” of Fontabelle on the left, and the barracks and trees of the barrackyard on the right, and with a background of cane-fields sloping backwards to the highest part of the island, the view, though utterly untropical, is not otherwise than pretty. But any favourable illusion is immediately dispelled upon landing. I have been at Suez, I have been at Southport, and I have been at Bognor; but a town so detestable in all ways as Bridgetown I have never beheld. Built upon no particular plan, its dirty lanes are continually blocked with sugar-drays and other vehicles....There is not a decent street or a passable building in the town. A pretty drinking-fountain, indeed, was sent out from England, and erected in an open space, but for some reason known to the “powers that be” alone, it is always dry. In another open space, defiled by heaps of rubbish and two or three squalid hovels, stands a statue of Nelson, painted with exquisite taste of a bright pea-green colour! This space is called Trafalgar Square; and it is an article of the Barbadian creed that it rivals “the finest site in Europe.” At this point a little muddy creek runs up into the land, and in wet weather receives a driblet of fresh water from the upper country. The upper part of the creek, near the Rectory and the General's residence, forms an unwholesome little swamp, overgrown with dwarf mangroves, and emitting an indescribable stench when, at low tide, it is exposed to the rays of the tropical sun. Two hundred years ago Ligon complained of this creek, that it “vented out so loathsome a savour as cannot but breed ill blood;” and it will probably be two hundred years more before the modern Bims will bestir themselves to abate the nuisance. The chapterless cathedral and parish church of St. Michael stands in this neighbourhood. It is a big ugly pew-rented church, without any architectural features whatsoever. There is no cathedral service, but the old “parson and clerk duet” of the last century still prevails. What little singing there is, is “done” by a few quavery “ladies and gentlemen of the congregation,” stuck up in a west gallery, for flirtation and observation. The daughter churches—here called chapels—are, with one exception (St. Leonard's), even more hideous than their particularly plain mother. The creek already named is crossed by a bridge, which may possibly be finished in the course of a century or two. It is the successor of the original wooden bridge from which the city derived its name, the more picturesque name of St. Michael's being now applied only to the parish. Below the bridge, narrow quays extend as far as the sea. Here lighters are being continually filled with sugar and rum for conveyance to the ships, which are compelled to lie at anchor in the roadstead.",

    "Description":"It is hard to give a readable description of a place which in great measure is physically so tame and uninteresting as is Barbados, but the attempt shall nevertheless be made. The island, which is twenty-one miles long by fourteen in breadth at the widest point, resembles in shape a shoulder of mutton, the thin end being towards the north. It is divided into eleven parishes, most of which are again divided ecclesiastically into chapelry districts. The geological structure of the island is curious, and deserves a closer investigation than it has received. Unlike the rest of the Antilles, it presents no traces of igneous origin or volcanic formation. At least three-fourths of the island—all, i.e. except the so-called “Scotland district”—is formed of reefs of coral rock, which rise in successive terraces from the south and west towards the east and north, the former being evidently those which were the last upheaved. Upon these terraces of coral lies a deposit of brown or black soil, the remains of the forests, which, before its settlement and cultivation, everywhere covered the island. This soil is of great richness, and notwithstanding the destructive practice of burning the trash of the sugar-canes year after year, seems still of exuberant fertility. Latterly, however, guano has been used to a considerable extent, and without artificial stimulus the soil can scarcely be expected to hold out for many years longer. The expanses of ground lying upon the successive rock-terraces are of a plain or gently undulating character, and present to view wide tracts of undivided cane-fields, and yam and sweet-potato grounds, dotted here and there with the wooden shanties of the labourers, and the estate-houses and mills of the planters, with their tall chimneys, and groups of three or four cabbage-palms. But for these last the beholder might almost fancy himself in Lincolnshire: nothing can be uglier or more prosaic. There are no hedges or other divisions between the cane-fields; and, except the few around the estate-houses, scarcely a tree is to be seen. From these plains rise the grey terraces of coral rock, which bound the prospect in that direction, and which often form steep precipices, at the foot of which the waves of the ocean probably beat in the successive ages of their upheaval.",

    "YearOfTravel":1867,
    "Description":"From Barbados it is a voyage of less than three days to George Town, the capital of the united provinces of Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo, known conjointly as British Guiana. At least seventy miles from the coast of South America I noticed a change in the colour of the water, caused by the mud brought down by the “great river Oronoco,” of which Robinson Crusoe and poor Friday used to discourse, and by the Pomeroon, Essequibo, Demerara, and other rivers. As the water became tinged with mud, the flights of flyingfish, so pleasant to watch upon a wearisome voyage, no longer gladdened the sight. The steamer was unluckily late in arriving at the light-ship, and we had to lie to all night, rocking upon the muddy waves, some ten miles off the harbour, the numerous mud-banks rendering it unsafe to approach the harbour during the darkness. The first sight of the South American Continent is, at this point, far from impressive, being simply a long line of wood rising above muddy water. When I woke next morning, we were lying in the harbour, and as I looked through my cabin window, I could almost have fancied I was lying off dear old Lynn in Norfolk, so muddy was the harbour, and so flat the coast. The harbour of George Town is formed by the mouth of the Demerara River, and the city lies along its bank as far as a low point of land which juts out into the sea, and is defended by a rotten fort. The opposite point is lined by mangrove and other trees, which extend far into the muddy water, and form a malarious and frightful swamp. The eye ranges a long way up the wide, muddy river, whose banks are lined with swamps and jungle, of which the branches dip into the water, and above which, here and there, peers up the tall chimney of the works on some sugar plantation, highly suggestive of Marshland or the fens of Cambridgeshire. One lands at George Town upon a small wooden pier, the river and sea frontage being unfortunately cut up in a right British fashion into private wharves, no public right of way existing along the banks; a capital defect in an otherwise well-laidout town. Debouching from a narrow lane, the new comer finds himself in a broadish street of great length, lined with the stores and offices of the various merchants. This street, with one or two windings, extends as far as the fort already named, and gives access to a kind of promenade on the sea-wall beyond, growing, as it advances, gradually meaner and meaner. In the other direction it ends in a kind of swamp, abounding in rushes, and lit at night by fireflies. In the midst of this swamp stand the public buildings, one of the ugliest and meanest piles in the British Empire. Beyond this is a suburb named Charlestown....So far, however, as general cleanliness, progress, convenience, and even a kind of beauty are concerned, the change from Bridgetown to George Town is a change from barbarism to civilization. The streets are wide and well laid out, and generally run in straight lines. Excepting Water Street, which is the Strand of George Town, and which is full of stores, the streets, which are of great length, have straight canals running through the midst; these being relics of the old Dutch dominion. The canals are sometimes lined with oleanders, and are always bordered by strips of grass. Next, upon either side, come the two carriage ways, then other strips of grass, and then the houses, which stand single, and commonly have beautiful gardens around and between them. In the midst of the town is an open space, called the Parade Ground, where the Demeraran youth disport themselves at cricket, and hard by is a small but pretty botanical garden.",

    "Description":"After remaining a short time at George Town, I started by a small steamer for New Amsterdam, the capital of the province of Berbice. The distance is about sixty miles, and the voyage was monotonous enough, nothing occurring to break the line of dense forest, which extends all the way along the coast. About 4 P. M. we entered the Berbice river, and a village on the left was pointed out as the capital. A more wretched place can scarcely be conceived. Two streets of detached houses, with a few stores, run parallel to the river and to each other; a gaunt-looking court-house rises from the mud at one end, an ugly church, and two or three meeting-houses, are dotted about at intervals;—and that is all. Night and day, a heavy stillness broods over everything, and if you are lucky enough to meet an occasional foot-passenger, he looks half asleep. A mile off in a swamp, and partly surrounded by bush, is a military lunatic asylum. Whether the unhappy inmates or the voluntary citizens of New Amsterdam are the madder of the two, may well admit of question. Behind the town is a mud-wall, like a “drove” in the Isle of Ely, then a long draining-canal, containing alligators, and then sugar-estates intermixed with bush. All is dull and damp and swelteringly hot; the wonder being that every one is not always down with fever. The only good thing in the place is the hotel.",

    "Description":"The capital of Trinidad, the largest West Indian Island, after Jamaica, which belongs to England, is Port of Spain. It is a beautifully-situated city, lying on a small plain of alluvial soil between forest-clad mountains and the Gulf, which, with the vast mountain masses of misnamed Venezuela beyond, it overlooks. Wide quays extend along the seaside, and the streets are all planned at right angles to each other. The principal street is a really grand one. It is of great width, and a wide strip of grass, shaded by cabbage-palms and other flowering and forest trees, passes down its centre. In the midst is a plashing fountain; at one end is the Roman Catholic Cathedral, at the other end the sea. Along half the length of this noble street the houses are arcaded, as in an Italian town. Gravely walking about, and almost disputing the right-of-way with the passers-by, are a number of huge, black, vulture-like crows, with bare heads and necks. These birds, in consideration of their use as scavengers, are protected from injury by legislative enactment. At a short distance from this street, which is in truth a noble Alameda of the Spanish type, is a spacious square laid out with grass, refreshed by another fountain, and shaded by fine trees. Hard by are the Government offices. On one side of the square is the Anglican Church, a large oblong building, with a wide-spanning and somewhat grand roof of dark timbers, which is popularly believed to rival that of Westminster Hall. Many of the streets have rills of water running through them. Behind the city is an extremely beautiful park, dotted with fine timber and grazed by herds of cattle, and adjoining it, but extending up some of the lower spurs of the mountains, a magnificent Botanical Garden. I have seldom seen a more beautiful place. Nature in her loveliest forms is only assisted by art. The collection of palms is very good and varied; the most exquisite, perhaps, of all being a native of Trinidad, a plant whose enormous fronds spring out of the ground to a height of perhaps thirty feet. The nutmeg-trees with their shining leaves and apricot-coloured fruit, which when ripe bursts and displays the rich brown nut covered with scarlet mace, are also very fine. This garden is the resort of numberless humming-birds, which rifle the flowers immediately above one's head as one sits on a trellice-covered seat. The view from the hill above, with the tranquil park and city simmering in the heat and slumbering at its base, the placid blue-green Gulf, and the purple Cordilleras beyond, is one to remember for a lifetime, and to carry away imprinted on the mind as a solace amidst future troubles which none can take away.",

These two mountain masses, which are called respectively the Gros and Petit Piton , though there is a difference of but thirty feet between them, are two enormous cones of rock rising abruptly from the deep sea to the height, it is said, of more than 2,500 feet. The Gros Piton is covered with wood, and has been ascended, while the Petit Piton displays more of bare rock, and is reputed to be impracticable for the foot of man. In four hours after leaving the Pitons, we had crossed the strait, and were steaming along the leeward coast of St. Vincent, under the noble forms of the Souffriere, Grand Bonhomme, and other volcanic peaks of the great central chain of Morne Garou. At length rounding the lofty headland, which is crowned by Fort Charlotte, we found ourselves in the Bay of Kingstown, the capital town, and I was able to go ashore.",

    "Description":"At length rounding the lofty headland, which is crowned by Fort Charlotte, we found ourselves in the Bay of Kingstown, the capital town, and I was able to go ashore. Kingstown consists mainly of two parallel streets, and a kind of esplanade, which faces the sea, and boasts of a little wooden jetty. To the right is the headland already mentioned, beautifully wooded, and crowned by the fort and barracks; to the left, Sion Hill, another green headland of almost equal height, and beyond the varied outline of the Island of Bequia, the nearest of the Grenadines. Behind, green cane-fields and provision grounds, dotted with estate-houses, labourers' dwellings, and fine trees, extend upwards to a semicircle of mountains, of which the highest is known as Mount St. Andrew's. Like all the other mountains of St. Vincent, except the Souffriere, these are clothed to the summit with dense forests. In the midst of Kingstown is a market-place, shaded by fine bread-fruit and mango trees, and overlooked by the court-house and seat of the Legislature. A little further on is the parish church, which resembles a tea-chest with a pepper-pot attached, and opposite the church an enormous Methodist meeting-house, also like a tea-chest, but without a pepper-pot. The seats in the “church” are annually put up to auction, “according to law,” in the court-house, and sold to the highest bidders! This disgraceful transaction used to take place in the church itself. About a quarter of a mile from the town are the remains of a fine botanical garden. This is now a mere wilderness of magnificent nutmeg, clove, and other choice trees, for the grant by which it was supported has been withdrawn, and the garden itself abandoned to ruin. The town contains between 5,000 and 6,000 inhabitants, amongst whom are a considerable number of immigrants from Madeira. There is no book-shop, but two newspapers are published every week. I noticed a couple of schooners in course of building under some silk-cotton trees upon the beach, and the bay is enlivened by a constant succession of droghers and other small craft, from the windward coast and the nearest of the Grenadines. The first and last distinguishing quality of the inhabitants, as compared with the Bims, which struck me, was their unbounded hospitality. During the whole of my stay in the island I was continually accepting or refusing invitations, being provided with ridinghorses, and being passed on from one hospitable house to another. The clergy are a completely different race of beings to those of Barbados.",

This volcanic rock is of a beautiful purplish-red colour, and is ascended by some 250 steps. The summit commands an exquisite view of mountain, sea, and islands. The entrance to the Bay of Calliaqua is obstructed by coral reefs, parts of which are dry at very low tides. The coral is being continually brought ashore, for the purpose of being burnt into lime, and fetches about ten shillings per boat-load. A heavy boat is anchored above the reef, and the masses of growing coral are detached and brought up by long iron instruments. The fresh coral is of a tawny yellow colour, and comes up slimy and smelling abominably. Sponges, corallines, and magnificent sea-fans grow in immense profusion, and present a beautiful spectacle as one peers down through the pellucid water to the surface of the reef.",

    "Description":"The change from the prosaic ugliness, incivility, and outer barbarism of Bridgetown, Barbados, to the romantic beauty, civility, and civilization of the French island of Guadaloupe is indeed immense. The very moment one lands at Basseterre, the seat of Government, it is plain that one is not in an English island, for one finds oneself at once—as also at St. Pierre, in Martinique—in a beautiful promenade of shady tamarind-trees, with seats placed for the refreshment of wayfarers. The streets are all neatly paved, with rills of water at the sides; and not a beggar is to be seen, vagrancy being prohibited by law, and each person being compelled to support himself, or work for his livelihood. Basseterre is beautifully situated on the lowest seaward slope of the Souffriere, a noble volcanic mountain, which, the two Pitons of St. Lucia being alone excepted, I take to be the finest mountain in the West Indies. Its base lies in the deep sea, from which ascends a zone of exquisite cultivation; then succeeds a tract of forestland, from which the several summits of the mountain ascend; the principal cone, which contains the crater, being covered with but little herbage, and being walled at its summit by huge masses of rock. The height I should suppose to be more than 5,000 feet. Basseterre is a small city, but it is well laid out. A torrent rushes down through its midst, and to the south-west there is a magnificent ravine, crossed by a bridge of a single arch, under which a rushing river finds its way to the sea. A mile and a half in the contrary direction there is another and still more beautiful ravine, and the river which forms it roars down over huge masses of black volcanic rock, and presents the most delicious pools for bathing. The blessing and luxury of such streams can be appreciated by those only who have visited the tropics. The various Government offices are arranged so as to face a large square of grass, which is bordered by fine cabbage-palms and mango-trees, and which commands a magnificent view, both of the mountains and of the sea. Beyond are the barracks of the Marines and a dismantled fort. The Cathedral is a small and unpretending, but solemn, pleasing, and cool building. It is apsidal, and its low round arches are formed of the volcanic stone of the country. The frequent earthquakes by which the island is visited preclude the possibility of the erection of a lofty tower, but advantage is taken of higher ground immediately above the church, so that the low tower, which is surmounted by a shingled spire, appears to be of considerable elevation. This expedient, so suited to the peculiar necessities of the place, is worthy of great admiration. Hard by is a large seminary conducted by the Frères Chrètiens, and the Palace of the Bishop, with a pretty garden and trellised vines in front.",

Abutting upon the quay there is a fine promenade lined with seats and overhung with majestic sandbox or sablier trees. The shops are numerous and good, and there is an excellent market. This last is well supplied with carrots, turnips, asparagus, and other European vegetables; and during my whole stay in Guadaloupe I feasted on a delicious mountain raspberry, in taste and colour much resembling an Alpine strawberry.The streets of Pointe-à-Pitre are clean and well laid out, and not a beggar is to be seen. All classes are distinguished by quietness, politeness, and propricty, and one meets with a refreshing civility in the shops. The French negroes are distinguished from those of Barbados by their women wearing a large quantity of jewelry, of which many objects wrought in mock-pearls resemble those of the peasantry in parts of Italy. In the country estates a considerable number of Madras coolies have been introduced. There is a very fair hotel at La Pointe, and the cuisine is excellent. Altogether, there is far more of European comfort, refinement, and civilization in the French than in the English Islands, and an educated Englishman would feel far more at home either in Martinique or Guadaloupe than in Barbados. The harbour at Pointe-à-Pitre is remarkably safe, and during the hurricane season it is the station of a small French ship of war.",

    "Description":"Soon the forts and white houses of La Guayra appeared at the base of the mountain, and ere long a war-steamer was descried, engaged, apparently, in bombarding the town and receiving the fire of the forts. A nearer approach showed that idea to be erroneous, for the ships at anchor before the town all displayed the Venezuelan standard hoisted half-mast high in token of some public calamity. It turned out that General Monagas, President Elect of the Republic, had just died, and was that day being buried in Caracas, and minute guns were being fired in celebration of the event. The view from the sea of La Guayra, the port of entry to the Venezuelan capital, is of singular loveliness. Above rises the huge mass of La Silla, with its twin summits, resembling in form, as its name indicates, the double peaked Spanish saddle; the upper slopes clothed with forests, the middle dotted With rare haciendas peeping out from their plantations of coffee; the lower slopes, of great steepness, formed of red torrent-seamed earth, overgrown with sparse brushwood and vast candelabra-like cactuses, and ending abruptly on the beach. The town, which is defended by a wall and by two or three forts, extends up the side of the mountain, and up a ravine, which runs up obliquely from the sea. To the left is a new sea-wall, with a fine esplanade leading to the village of Macuto; and to the right the populous village of Mayquetia, with dense groves of huge cocoapalms, and Cape Blanco beyond. La Guayra can boast of no regular harbour: the ships lie in an exposed roadstead, and landing is extremely difficult on account of the tremendous surf which almost constantly breaks upon the shore....The streets of La Guayra are clean and well kept, and there are numerous fountains. A recently planted Alameda has already begun to supply the shade which is so much needed, for La Guayra enjoys the reputation of being one of the hottest places in the world. I found tolerable accommodation in the “Posada Neptuno,” of which the padrone is an Italian from the neighbourhood of Genoa. Hard by is an excellent club. the “Club Union Guarena,” to which strangers are liberally introduced. There are refreshment and billiard-rooms, a considerable library, and a readingroom well supplied with English and other European newspapers. It speaks well for the energy of the mercantile community of La Guayra, that they should establish and support so excellent an i\\nstitution.",

    "Description":"From La Guayra there is a mule-track leading direct over the mountain to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, and a road, traversed twice daily by a kind of diligence, has been constructed by a longer route of some twenty miles. Leaving La Guayra at four in the morning, I commenced the ascent in the brightest moonlight I ever saw. It was easy to read the smallest small print. The sky was exquisitely clear when day broke, and revealed the full beauties of the scenery, and the great billowy mountains, green with forest, rolling down to the blue billows of the sea. Every now and then we passed long trains of carts drawn by mules, and convoys of mules and asses laded with coffee or cocoa, and conducted by picturesque red-brown men and boys wrapped in blue and scarlet ponchos. The road passes round the corner of a mountain at the height of at least 5,ooo feet and then descends rapidly upon the other side of the range. Another ascent conducts into the magnificent valley, or rather elevated plain, of Chicao; upon which, at the base of the steep slopes of La Silla, lies the city of Caracas, at a height of 2,880 feet above the sea. Though the sun here is hot, the air is clear and fresh and the climate generally delightful. The lower slopes of La Silla, upon this side, have been cleared of their covering of forest, and, except in the gullies, are covered with rough grass, and display, here and there, the red micaceous clay of which they are externally composed. The vega , or plain, is of great length, and is partly cultivated and partly grass-grown, and strewn with the grey ruins of huge convents, overthrown by the earthquake of 1812. A sufficiency, though not an abundance, of water is conveyed into the city, and partially irrigates the plain. One end of the city is dominated by a rounded red hill, crowned by a white Calvary Church. The city itself almost exactly resembles a fine Spanish city cut off at the first story, a few only of the public buildings cropping out into an apologetic and tentative second story. The houses are covered with plaster of dazzling whiteness, and are roofed with broad red tiles, made on the spot. The centre of the city is occupied by a handsome square, now being adorned with fountains. Upon one side stand the Cathedral and Archbishop's Palace, and opposite to them the Palace of Government. The Cathedral has five aisles, but is remarkable only for its extreme cleanness; in some of the side-chapels, however, there are rich gilded retablos of pure Spanish style.",

The greater part of the intermediate coast is lined by low cayos and islets, but lofty mountains run along at the distance of a few miles from the shore. Puerto Cavello, which is a town of some 8,000 inhabitants, is built on a low spit of sand in the neighbourhood of pestilential marshes, which, with a burning sun, render the place very unhealthy. It is, however, a place of considerable trade, and the harbour is good and safe. I rode inland to see the beautiful valley near the village of San Esteban, which is a summer resort of the merchants of Puerto Cavello. The scenery is very charming, and a purling stream keeps the whole valley full of the most exuberant vegetation. Notwithstanding the bad government, travelling in the interior of Venezuela is said to be safe, and arms are carried rather from habit than for use. The demeanour of the people of all ranks and colours is singularly courteous.",

I had been at Bognor, I had been at Suez, and I had been at Bridgetown, Barbados, and I thought I had seen the three vilest towns in the world. But I was mistaken: Colon, or Aspinwall, as the Americans call it, beats them all in hopeless ugliness and unredeemed blackguardism. Colon is situated under a blazing sun upon the swampy shore of the Isthmus of Panama. It is itself a swamp, with a few wharves upon its outer edge, and with a few shanties and tottering brick buildings sinking into the mud upon which they are placed. The principal row of houses looks out upon the Panama Railway, and in two places only is there anything which can be called a street. Pools of stagnant water are interspersed among the houses. There is no drainage; dead dogs, broken bottles, and every kind of filth are thrown into the roadways, and lie festering upon the mud of which the latter are composed. The population is made up of the scum and dregs of other countries. Murders and every kind of crime are of constant occurrence, and the Government of New Granada is either afraid or unwilling to interfere. The night before my arrival three or four people and soldiers were killed in a row, and I met the polished mahogany coffin of a murdered man coming down the street on the head of a trotting and merrily-singing negro. Yellow fever, Chagres fever, smallpox, and cholera alternate, and sometimes all four are rampant at once.",

    "Description":"Running straight into the midst of a long line of low rocks which lined the coast of Cuba, and behind which a long range of hills and mountains swelled up in the interior. A nearer approach, however, disclosed a narrow passage guarded by an old yellowruddled Moresco looking fort, upon which the red and yellow flag of Spain was flying. After several windings amidst low scrub-covered hills, interpenetrated by little creeks of blue water, the passage widens out into a lagoon, at the upper end of which appears the city of Santiago de Cuba, now the second city, but formerly the capital of the island. A large Spanish frigate and two or three gun-boats lay off the town, and the latter were discharging troops and field-guns; but with this exception there was no stir whatsoever. The city looked like a city of the dead, scarce a person appeared on the shore, and all commerce was suspended. The reason of this was that the city was closely invested by the insurgents, who had advanced within about a mile of the gates. Although I carried a Spanish passport, for which I had paid eight shillings to the Spanish consul at Kingston, I was not allowed to go ashore; and although we remained four-and-twenty hours, the efforts of the English Vice-Consul in my behalf were not crowned with success. Seen from the anchorage, the city of Santiago, or Cuba , as it is invariably called by the natives, presents a very handsome appearance. It is built on the slopes of a low hill, which runs back from the sea, the summit being occupied by the Cathedral and a huge raspberry-jam-coloured barracks. The environs are 174 clad with wood, amidst which appear haciendas and plots of cultivated ground, while above green hills rise, until they attain the elevation of mountains.",

Here the captain, acting evidently under official instructions, opposed my going ashore, whereupon I told him he must use force to prevent me, on which he gave in, and politely took me ashore in his own boat. Gibara is a small town of some two thousand inhabitants, upon a pretty bay. The opposite shores are well wooded, and beyond are some finely-shaped craggy hills, of which the shape of one resembles that of the Salisbury Crags. The church of Gibara stands in the midst of a small square; it is a debased building, painted bright yellow, picked out with white, with doors and domes of a bright red. The hill-slopes behind the town, as well as the town itself, were all divested of trees, which had been cut down to form a hastily constructed fortification around the town. Two extemporized forts crowned the slopes, mounting two or three guns, and flying the Spanish flag. Every street, moreover, was blocked by carefully-made barricades, pierced for musketry. All trade was suspended, the shops were shut, and the streets were full of soldiers and involuntary volunteers, the latter distinguished by a red cockade. A corvette, the “ Blasco de Garay ,” lay in the bay, and, the previous day, had sent thirty shots into a house tenanted by some of the insurgent party. The rebels now lay in force in the woody country behind the town, to the number, it was believed, of 2,000 men, and an immediate attack upon the place was apprehended.",

    "Description":"Our next stopping-place was the town of San Fernando de Nuevitas. Turning in from the sea we entered a sort of broad river between perfectly flat but rocky shores, densely covered with scrubby forest. In front appeared low escar-looking hills, which, rising above the trees in the evening haze, looked like the rounded hills which rise from the Bog of Allen. These hills turned out to be islands in a great lagoon or salt-water lake, into which the channel opens out. As we threaded the shallows of this great expanse, which is called the “Bahia de Nuevitas,” the sun set red and lurid, and then “at one stride came the dark,” out of which, ere we cast anchor, glimmered the distant lights of San Fernando. Sunrise next morning displayed the great Bahia de Nuevitas to perfection. There is nothing tropical about the scenery, and were it not for the heat and its great size, I could almost have fancied myself on one of the “Broads” of my dear native county of Norfolk. As we rowed ashore, a distance of a mile, upon the unruffled surface of the lake, the sun leaped above the horizon, and tinged the waters with every tint of gold and orange and pale blue, while its golden track was flecked here and there by the passage across it of great brown pelicans, or by the rising of some huge creature of the porpoise tribe. The town of San Fernando de Nuevitas is a wretched place. The streets are all unpaved, and full of baked yellow mud, which in wet weather must be impassable. The houses are all of one story, with lofty iron-barred windows of true Spanish appearance. The people struck me as singularly handsome and noble-looking. The permanence of the Spanish type is remarkable. The Englishman degenerates into the ignoble Bim or changes into the drawn-out Yankee, but the Spaniard of Venezuela or Cuba is as true a Spaniard in appearance as is the Spaniard of Burgos or Toledo. Nuevitas derives its importance from the fact of its being the port of the considerable inland town of Puerto Principe. We took on board a few wounded Spanish soldiers and several prisoners. Some of the latter were arrested on suspicion only, and had that morning been torn away from their families, and hurried on board without even a change of clothes. A young American lady was not even allowed by the Spanish commander to have a pair of shoes which she had ordered of a shoemaker in Puerto Principe.",

    "Description":"The City of Havana, or Habana, as it is usually spelt by the inhabitants, is situated upon the western side of a magnificent harbour, which separates it from the forts of El Morro and Cavaña, and from the suburb of Regla, which is to Havana what Birkenhead is to Liverpool, or Gosport to Portsmouth. The harbour has a narrow entrance completely dominated by the guns of El Morro and of a fort upon the western or city side, but it rapidly widens out, and affords a splendid land-locked anchorage for ships of the largest burden. From some points of view it somewhat reminds one of the great harbour at Malta. The quays are spacious, and extend a long distance; but the amount of commerce is so great that numbers of ships have to lie out in the harbour and discharge into lighters. The city rises gently from the edge of the harbour to the ridge of a low hill, which was formerly crowned by bastioned fortifications. These, however, have either been removed, or are in course of removal, and a splendid boulevard has been formed upon their site, and outside this a new city has sprung up almost as large as the old one. The Cathedral in the lower town is a building of quaint debased architecture, but for the New World looks venerable. Inside, its size redeems it from ugliness, and its thick walls and small windows render it delightfully cool. The Coro is in the eastern limb, and does not extend westward, as is usual in Spain. The church is memorable as the resting-place of the great Columbus. He was buried near the high altar, and in the wall hard by there is a bust and epitaph, apparently reproduced from an older one. The insciption under the bust runs thus:— IO RESTOS E YMAGEN DEL GRANDE MIL SIGLOS DVRAD GVARDALOS EN LA YRNA YEN LA REMEMBRANZA DE NVESTRA NACION. The other churches, save a handsome new one in course of construction, merit no attention, but some of the best have been desecrated and turned into warehouses. The clergy are universally accused of gross ignorance, and they are held in great contempt. Religion has done little or nothing to ameliorate the condition of the slaves, whom the priesthood have allowed to grow up without instruction in even the rudiments of the Christian faith. There are but two Bishoprics in the island, which is nearly as large as all England—the Metropolitan see of Santiago de Cuba, and the Provincial see of Havana. The clergy are poor, and paid by the State. Near the harbour is a pretty square, from whose centre rises a white marble statue of Don Ferdinand the Catholic; around are parterres of sweet flowers, some beautiful feathery cabbage-palms, and rows of bearded figs. This Plaza is overlooked by the Palace of the Captain-General. A military band plays here every evening. The streets of the older part of the city are narrow, as they ought to be in a hot climate, but confusion is prevented by a regulation by which wheeled carriages are compelled to go up some streets and down others. All the streets are clean, well lighted with gas, and lined with handsome shops. The houses are all built in the old Spanish style, with lofty iron-grated windows, at which the women sit in the afternoon, and the patios, passages, and window-sills are lined with handsome azulejo tiles, which, with their bright-coloured Moresco patterns, are still imported largely from Spain. The roofs are flat, and people may be seen in the evening walking upon them and catching the sea-breeze, as in an eastern city. The houses are painted white or yellow, and are sometimes picked out with other bright colours. Altogether Havana has all the appearance of a rich and civilized southern European capital. The cafés are excellent, and wine, beer, and confectionery are sold in them, as well as coffee. At night they are crowded. The cleanliness, cheerfulness, and attention of the waiters are worthy of all praise. The “Louvre” café, near the Theatre Tacon, is equal to any of the best in Paris or Naples. The boulevard at the top of the town called the “Parque,” might be a bit of the Champs Elysées. It is beautifully laid out with parterres, statues, and seats, and is crowded in the evening when the band plays. Here the beautiful Cuban ladies come in their volantes in evening dress. The central ornament of this Parque was a statue of Queen Isabella, but early on the morning of my arrival, it was 181 removed by order of General Dulce, lest it should excite “re-actionist” sentiments. The inscription originally ran: “ La Lealtad Española a Isabella Segunda; ” but the three last words were chiselled off, so Spanish loyalty remained without an object.",

    "Description":"After Havana, with its bright sun, and clean streets, and cheerful promenades, New Orleans seemed a dingy and dreary place enough. The sky was leaden, a blackish fog hung over the city and river, and the whole place reeked with damp and smelt of mud. Many weeks' residence did little towards modifying this, my first unfavourable impression of “the Crescent City.” In fact, New Orleans, although a large, is very far from being a fine city. Built on a bend of the Mississippi (hence its name “the Crescent City”), at the distance of about 130 miles from the bar, New Orleans has long since overflowed the bend, and now stretches for some five miles along the banks of the river, which forms its northern boundary. The river itself is considerably higher than the town, and is only kept out by banks, here termed Levees. As it is, a considerable quantity of water percolates through the banks, and runs in filthy green open gutters through the streets, and so into the festering swamp which lies between the city and Lake Ponchartrain, three miles distant. After the prevalence of certain winds this lake has a disagreeable way of backing up and inundating the city, and in time of flood there is danger of the Mississippi forming a breach and pouring down into it. The city, therefore, is continually in danger, by being between two waters, which is perhaps a degree worse than being between two fires. It is built upon mud, and, for I don't know how many swampy leagues, there is nothing but mud—mud black and deep, mud without the admixture of even the tiniest stones or smallest fragment of gravel. Only a few of the central streets of the city are paved, the rest are simply deep quagmires, with or without a central railroad track, as the case may be. The mud in these streets is such that I constantly saw carts and waggons abandoned, although drawn by powerful horses and mules; and I and the other passengers had, one day, to turn out of a street omnibus, and entirely unload a wood-dray, which had become hopelessly embogged in front of us. The gutters have steep perpendicular sides, and are crossed at street corners by small bridges, consisting of single stones, and allowing two persons at the most to cross at a time. I had previously supposed that Tunis was the muddiest city in the universe, but Tunis can no more compete with New Orleans in the matter of mire than it can with Cairo in point of beauty. Speaking generally, New Orleans bears a strong resemblance to some of the worst parts of Liverpool near the docks. The street architecture is deplorably mean; but, to speak correctly, and excepting only the old French buildings in Jackson Square, architecture has scarcely been introduced at all. The unfinished Custom-House is a deplorable building. It is built of a sad grey granite, has some fluted columns with heavy Egyptian capitals, and all its windows are stuffed up with timber. It is intended to erect another story, but before that is put on, the basement will probably have sunk down into the mud. Inside, however, there is a handsome (unfinished) hall. The principal street is Canal Street, which runs in a straight line from the levee far out into the swamps behind, and may be said to divide the city into two pretty equal parts. This street begins mean enough, picks up a little near the Custom-House, becomes tolerably handsome near the statue of Henry Clay, drops off below Christ Church, degenerates rapidly at Rampart Street, and becomes more and more beggarly, until it runs out into a foul, malarious swamp, and ends appropriately enough at a knot of cemeteries of Christians and Jews. The cemeteries, or “rests,” are full of tasteless whited sepulchres and cypresses, amongst which the members of the different firemen's companies have common tombs. Beyond again, across a canal connecting with the lake, is the Metairie Racecourse and another. Here many fine horses are kept and trained, but the Magnolia Race-course, near Mobile, is preferred. The course is composed of hardened mud. A few days after my arrival there was a tremendous rain, when a great part of the city was inundated, many car-routes rendered impassable, and numbers of houses filled with water. I saw a baker delivering bread all down a street in a boat. The prettiest spot in New Orleans is Jackson Square, so called from a bronze equestrian statue of General Jackson, which, defended by an apple-green railing, rampages in the midst. When the Northerners took New Orleans they, with exquisite taste, cut twice upon the granite pedestal of this statue,—àpropos to nothing that was said or done by General Jackson—“ The Union must and shall be preserved. ” Overlooking this square, which is laid out as a garden with formal parterres and seats, is the French Cathedral of St. Louis and two Court-Houses, built in the old French style. These three buildings have a certain old-world picturesqueness of their own, and, considering where they are, look quite venerable. At all events, they put to shame the flimsy buildings of iron and compo, which is the present fashion. The Cathedral, which has three blue-slated spires, was occupied as head-quarters during the siege in the late war. Inside it has nothing but its size to recommend it. It is crowded on Sundays, and mariners of almost all nations may be seen amongst the worshippers.",

The evening was cold but clear, and the sun, as is usual in a flat country, sank down in a blaze of crimson, gold, and purple, whose reflection painted the muddy waters of Lake Ponchartrain with the most exquisite tints of colour. Before midnight we were in a channel called the Rigolettes, and stopped for a few moments off Fort Pike. A great fire was raging in the forests behind the fort, which enabled us to see the fort, with every gun and sentrybox revealed as plain as by the light of day. These fires are caused by hunters, and at one time at least six were visible at once; some of them being a full mile in length. The effect of this in the dark still night was extremely fine. The shores of Lake Ponchartrain and the neighbouring islets are densely covered with forests, chiefly of pine and cypress, and abound with deer and other game.",

    "Description":"As we neared Mobile the stupendous works of the Confederates appeared on either side, consisting of piles, sunken ships, and even earthwork forts, supported on piling. The water was too low to admit of our taking the direct route, so we made a detour of three hours, passing far past and above the city, between reed-covered swamps, swarming with ducks and other sorts of wild-fowl, until we entered the Alabama river. Mobile, known as the “Gulf City,” is a place of some thirty thousand inhabitants, but its trade is at present in a depressed state, and the place has a wretched out-at-elbows appearance. It has one good building, the post-office, and one pretty square. This last is laid out in grass, and shaded by trees, and has in its centre a green mound, upon which stands a wooden stag of singularly life-like appearance. I was told it was the work of a self-taught German sculptor. Mobile Bay and the neighbouring shores abound with oysters. Men are perpetually employed upon the levee in opening them and putting them up in tin cases by hundreds for exportation. These oysters are of delicious flavour, and immensely large. They are quite commonly as long as a man's hand after they are taken out of the shell, and the proprietor of one establishment assured me he had them frequently as long as his foot. In the outskirts of the town there is a small settlement of Choctaw Indians. These poor people live in wigwams, or huts formed of bits of wood and the bark of trees, covered with rags and deerskins. These huts are very low, only admitting the inmates in a sitting posture, and they are open upon one side. In shape they somewhat resemble the tents of the poorest Algerine Arabs. A fire is made, and the cooking done outside. The huts are usually erected in the yard or paddock of some white man's house, and some of the families even inhabit wooden shanties. These= Indians mostly speak a little English, and have adopted the European dress.",

    "Description":"Natchez, which is also situated upon high land, we unfortunately stopped at in the night. Vicksburg, which was heroically defended for near two years during the war, and was at last taken by General Grant, is the largest town, although not the capital of the State of Mississippi. It is the Ehrenbreitstein, or Quebec, of that river. Like Baton Rouge and Natchez, it is situated upon the right bank going up, and like them also it is built upon a hill of yellow clay, which here attains a considerable elevation. Seen from below, at the end of a long reach of the river, with its great and still undestroyed earthworks, its Court-House, and the spire of the Roman Church on the highest points, Vicksburg has an imposing and even picturesque appearance. But further acquaintance shows it to be but a wretched place. The greater portion of the houses are mere negro shanties, thrown down so irregularly that they look as if they had been showered down at hap-hazard from a gigantic pepper-box. The streets are unpaved, deep in mud, and paraded by dignified hogs, and the Court-House is seen to be a wretched building of dilapidated brick, covered with dirty whitewash. But the view from the terrace of the Court-House is superb, and from this point the strength, peculiarity, and importance of the position becomes at once apparent. Immediately before the town, and extending more than a mile above it, is an extremely narrow tongue of low swampy land, behind which the Mississippi is seen running parallel with the town and with the portion of the river which washes its base. Sweeping round this low point the river thus doubles upon itself. The stream here is said to be no less than 360 feet in depth. Beyond the windings of the river the eye ranges over vast tracts of forest growing far as the eye can reach upon a perfectly flat plain. Inland, behind the ridge, the country consists of low hills of yellow clay, worn by the rains into numerous ravines. A little above the town, on the slope of the hill trending towards the river, is a cemetery, which already contains more than 25,000 bodies of Federal soldiers slain during the siege; others are continually being brought in from their temporary places of interment. An awful memorial this of what I heard a Yankee describe as “a little family quarrel.” The Confederate dead were generally buried where they fell.",

This flourishing new city stands on low yellow cliffs, which, at a little distance, resemble those of the coast of Norfolk. Spite of a drizzling rain, Memphis appeared a busy place, with fine stores and some well-paved streets, full of people. In a green square, planted with trees, in the centre of the town, are a number of squirrels, which, to the credit of the inhabitants, are so tame that they will even run up a stranger's legs and take nuts out of his hand. Yet, notwithstanding this tenderness towards brutes, human life is held cheap; “differences” and “difficulties,” ending in murder, being of most frequent occurrence. This, however, seems to be characteristic of the whole country. Within the last two years eight policemen have been murdered in Memphis. Memphis contains a large and rapidly increasing population.",

I was over my shoes in mud the first step I took on shore, and having struggled through the mud to the top of the levee, I found myself in a street so foully deep in mire, that I hesitated whether I should attempt to cross or return at once to the steamboat. Resolving at length upon the former course, I explored what may by courtesy be termed the town. It is a mixture of wooden shanties and hideous brick houses standing on the brink of yawning gulfs, filled with filth and brickbats, and of streets all but impassable from mud, and interspersed with deep holes filled with black slime. In the main street I saw a fine pair of mules vainly endeavouring to draw a lightly. loaded cart out of a quagmire. There are no crossings to any of the streets, and consequently the inhabitants all bore the appearance of mudlarks and nightmen. At one end of the town a huge dreary-looking hotel of red brick lifts itself up out of a slough of despond, and, from its utter incongruity, adds to the hopeless dismalness of the scene. Looking up the Ohio from Cairo, Mound City is descried at a bend of the river; looking down, the junction of the two great rivers is seen, with a somewhat fine reach of yellow water below, apparently surrounded by gloomy forests. Above Cairo the Mississippi sensibly contracts, and the scenery improves for the last hundred miles below St. Louis.",

    "Description":"Take it all in all, spite of its smoke, its dirt, and its indifferent climate, St. Louis is one of the finest of American cities. It is at present a city of the first rank as regards importance; and when its unrivalled position is taken into consideration, it seems probable that it may hereafter become the actual capital of a vast and magnificent nation. Situated on the line of the Great Pacific Railway, which must hereafter become the chief thoroughfare of the commerce of the world, upon a river which, with its tributaries, commands the traffic of half the continent, on the borders of vast tracts of the richest land in the world for agricultural purposes, close to almost boundless forests of valuable timber, and on the very spot where unlimited mineral wealth in coal and iron may be had for the digging; there seems to be no limit to the future power and prosperity of this capital of the mighty West. It has been the custom with some to say that St. Louis is “dying of natural advantages,” and it is possible that the possession of these may have caused her citizens to acquiesce in a course of comparative inaction, while the energies of their rivals at Chicago have been put forth to the utmost and even overtaxed; but new blood has been admitted to her councils, and now rapid progress is the order of the day. The new bridge over the Mississippi will be one of the wonders of the engineering world, and will, on its completion, restore to St. Louis all, and more than all, the opportunities she has lost. This bridge, from shore to shore, will measure, in total length, 1,689 feet, and will consist of three arches of cast steel, of which the two side spans will each measure 497 feet, and the central span 515 feet. When it is remembered that the widest arch-span in England is that of Southwark Bridge, which only measures 240 feet, the vastness of the work at St. Louis will be appreciated. It will be seen, from the foregoing measurements, that the river is comparatively narrow at St. Louis; its stream is consequently swift, and in places encumbered by sand-banks. The banks of the levee are somewhat steep, and the city rises over a ridge which extends along the shore, dives into a ravine, and ascends another eminence beyond. The riverfront is of vast length, and has an imposing appearance from the other side in the State of Illinois. St. Louis is a stone-built city, and contains several fine streets. The City Hall has a really picturesque dome, from whose summit a fine panorama is obtained of the city, river, and surrounding country. The finest building, however, is a new Episcopal Church, a cruciform structure of great size and noble proportions. The interior is very lofty, the walls are profusely polychromed, and an immense fresco of the Crucifixion occupies the eastern wall.",

    "Description":"Chicago, the greatest seat of the grain, live stock, and lumber trade in the United States, is, though one of the newest, one of the largest cities in the world. Possessed of almost unrivalled railway and water communication, and aided by a cool and bracing climate, her sons have developed a spirit of almost unequalled industry and enterprise. If, in the long run, St. Louis is destined to take the lead in the race of commercial prosperity, Chicago can never be very far behind. The city is situated at the flat and marshy head of the vast inland sea, Lake Michigan, and is itself, in great measure, built upon piles and made-land. Despite of its commercial prosperity, Chicago struck me as being the very ugliest city I have ever seen. Situated on a dead flat, its formal streets are unrelieved by a single building of architectural merit. To judge by the filthy and disgusting condition of the streets, the foul smells, the uneven pavement, and the numerous obstructions, one would suppose that Municipal Government, generally a failure in the States, was here altogether absent. In most of the streets the pavement is of wood, and as each man has the pavement before his own door at a different level from his neighbour's, one is continually running up and down stairs. The shores of the great Lake are perfectly flat, and its vast expanse of water resembles the sea, save that there is no tide to break its awful monotony, and that no fresh sweet sea-breezes blow across to elevate the spirits. In March the navigation was not yet open, the harbour was blocked with ice, and the sandy beach, strewn with small rounded pebbles of primitive rocks, was cut off from the sullen waves by a barrier of ice and frozen snow, extending along shore far as the eye can reach. A Park has been formed outside the town, near the Lake side, but at present the trees are no bigger than bushes, and penalties are denounced against any one who ventures to walk on the grass. Beyond the Park, the shores of the Lake are lined with low sanddunes, tufted with low shrubs and marram-like grass, a feature which adds to the maritime appearance of the scene. Good water not being obtainable from wells, Chicago is supplied by an ingenious expedient. A tunnel was boldly constructed under the Lake to a platform erected more than a mile from the shore, and the fresh cold water of the Lake is pumped therefrom into pipes, and so conducted to the town. Previous to the construction of these works the inhabitants depended mainly upon rain-water, collected in enormous wooden barrels, nearly as high as the houses. Like St. Louis, Chicago contains a very large population of Germans, who have their own shops, lager-beer saloons, churches, and places of amusement. German is almost as commonly heard in the streets as English. There is also a large colony of Jews. In one of the squares the Congregationalists have a tolerable Gothic chapel, not holding with Mr. C. Spurgeon that Gothic architecture was of the devil's invention; and the Unitarians possess a very pretentious mosque. The Episcopalian Cathedral is externally plain enough, but the interior is pretty; and the services, which are freely open to all, without distinction of persons, are unusually hearty and effective. The Bishop's seat occupies a position unique in Christendom. It is neither, according to primitive and Eastern usage, in the centre of the apse behind the altar, nor, according to Western usage, on the north side of the chancel in front, but it is placed behind the altar on the north-east side, a chair being set on the south-east side, also behind, for, I suppose, the rector or senior canon of the Church.",

The Ohio, here a noble stream with a considerable current, yellow as the Tiber, divides Cincinnati in Ohio, from Covington in Kentucky, and is spanned by a magnificent Suspension-Bridge, reputed the largest in the New World. The architect was a Prussian named Roebling. The banks on both sides are steep, and speedily rise into considerable hills dotted with wood. One of these, on the outskirts of Cincinnati, descends abruptly towards the river, and is crowned by a picturesque church. This hill, with the spire rising above the city, black with the smoke of foundries and 253 factories, reminded me of St. John's, in the Park at Sheffield, but the stream which sweeps its base is, I suppose, double as wide as the Thames at Hungerford. Just below the church is a quarry in the Silurian rock, which in this neighbourhood abounds with beautiful crinoids, trilobites, corals, and other fossils. Cincinnati, pronounced “Cincinna tah ,” is also known as Porkopolis, and was described to me by an inhabitant as “the Great Hog-centre of the Universe.” Its staple is hog's flesh. I visited one of the “converting” factories, and was courteously conducted over the premises by the proprietor. Enormous yards are provided for the pigs, and leading up from these to the summit of a huge building is a gradually ascending inclined plane. Up this, which narrows towards the top, the unconscious animals proceed, gently pressed onwards by those behind, until at length a small door is reached, from which there is no return. This fatal portal, which might well be inscribed with the “Lasciate ogni speranza” of Dante, admits but one hog at a time, and the moment he enters a knife descends and cuts his throat. The momentum which is communicated to the now lifeless body whorls it downwards to successive stages, where the various operations of disembowelling, scalding, and cutting up are performed, and the grunter, which, a minute before, entered the top story in the heyday of strength and porcine beauty, finds his rest in the cellars, a minute after, in the form of hams and sides, ready stored for exportation. The slaughter season was over when I visited this “institution,” but the premises, and especially the neighbourhood of the guillotine, were still redolent with an indescribably disgusting smell of mingled blood and fat. The process, however, is worthy of admiration on account of its efficiency, extraordinary quickness, and above all, for its humanity. Piggy. is engaged in a pleasant if up-hill walk; to gratify a laudable curiosity he enters a doorway, and then, in a moment, all is over;—without a moment's anxiety of mind or pain of body, Pig is converted into Pork. Requiescat in pace in the dura ilia of the devourers of his salted remains! Cincinnati is one of the handsomest and best-built towns in the States, though the streets, as usual, are extremely filthy. A breezy hill, covered with grass, is to be laid out as a public Park; near it, on a hill, is a tottering observatory, and an enormous firework manufactory.",

    "Description":"Approaching Pittsburg, the horizontal strata of blackish limestone approach the river in lofty cliffs, and tramways from the mines discharge their burdens into boats which lie underneath. At length the great smoke-city is seen upon a tongue of land between the Monongahela and Alleghany Rivers, which, flowing down with swift and eddying currents from the spurs of the Alleghany mountains, combine at this point to form the broad stream of the lordly Ohio. Spite of, and perhaps partly because of its smoke, Pittsburg has, for the United States, an unusually picturesque appearance. It is surrounded by lofty and steep hills, the rivers are spanned by noble bridges, and the Roman Cathedral which crowns an eminence near the centre of the city, though architecturally incorrect, is of noble size, and has about it an air of old-world quaintness, which, in a land of formality and straight lines, is highly pleasing. Within, the city is mean and filthy enough. I found here a Church Guild, to use an American phrase, “in full blast.” It provides a free reading-room and classes in several branches of secular knowledge. Notwithstanding its good old Saxon name of Guild, which is so alarming to certain dignitaries at home, this Society is in the hands of the low-church party, who, as in Ohio with its fanatical bishop, have the upper hand in Pennsylvania. Church Guilds, and even Young Men's Christian Associations, in the United States, have generally free reading-rooms open to the general public, a piece of sensible liberality which similar institutions amongst ourselves would do well to imitate.",

    "Description":"Baltimore, which was the first even tolerably clean city I had seen since I entered the States, struck me as being a very pleasant one, and the favourable impression left by a first visit was confirmed when I visited it a second time. Baltimore is situated near the Patapsco River, some ten miles above the Bay of Chesapeake. Seawards it is defended by Fort McHenry, whose earthworks mount guns of extraordinarily heavy metal. The city itself is built upon a large number of eminences and in the ravines which intersect them. The contour of the ground prevents that dismal uniformity which is so wearying in other American towns. At the top of the town, on a site 150 feet above high-water mark, stands the Washington monument, a column of white marble surmounted by a statue, and itself rising to a height of 167 feet. The view from the summit is fine and even beautiful, though the surrounding country is deficient in trees. Most of the houses are built of red brick, which forms an agreeable contrast with the stone churches which rise from their midst. The Roman Catholic Cathedral has a grand dome, but the interior is choked with hideous rented pews. One of the Episcopal Churches is a remarkably successful imitation of an Italian church. At the time of my first visit the aged and venerable Bishop of Maryland was holding a confirmation, before which a number of adults were publicly baptized. It was refreshing to see that the aged Bishop could kneel upright in prayer, instead of sprawling in a heap upon the altar, as is the use of so many Anglican prelates at home. The population of Baltimore amounts to some 200,000 souls, and the people are remarkable for their personal beauty and agreeable manners. If, which heaven forbid! I were compelled to fix my residence in an American city, I think I should fix on Baltimore.",

    "Description":"The Pennsylvania Avenue is an immense street, which extends nearly from one end of the city to the other; it is bordered by trees, but has but a mean appearance, as it is too wide for the height of the houses on either side. At one end is the hill on which is built the Capitol, and a fine view of the back and dome of that vast pile is seen from the street. The Capitol itself must be regarded as being, on the whole, a fine and imposing mass of public buildings; but its faults are many and ridiculous. To begin with, it is not built on the summit, but a little below the top of the ridge on which it stands, and its front is turned away from the city and looks uphill. The dome, which possesses some elements of grandeur, is overloaded with ornaments in questionable taste, and is, after all, a mere sham, being made of iron painted in imitation of stone. It is surmounted by a hideous object, supposed to be a piece of sculpture. But its worst fault is that it completely dwarfs the portico and central building out of which it rises. The more modern white marble wings are fine. Inside, the dome is handsome, but it is defaced by some of the most hideous daubs in creation. The chambers of the Senate and of Congress are fine rooms, but their acoustic properties do not seem to be much better than those of our own Houses of Parliament. In the former I saw the thin fussy face of Senator Sumner, who was then big with his bitter speech against England; and in the latter I saw “Beast” Butler, as he is called in the Southern newspapers, the elect of “moral Massachusetts.” The spacious galleries around the chamber of Congress are open to men and women alike, and some of the latter appeared to belong, as I was assured they did belong, to a most disreputable class of society. Within the Capitol, likewise, the Supreme Court of the United States holds its sittings. The judges—a fine looking body of men—are habited in black gowns, but the lawyers address the court in their ordinary dress. At the end of Pennsylvania Avenue farthest from the Capitol, is the Treasury, a fair building of white marble. Passing this one day, about four o'clock, I was nearly overwhelmed by an avalanche of young ladies, which burst out of the building and poured down the steps. These ladies, many of whom are excessively pretty, are employed as clerks in the Union Government Offices. The effect of this upon the young gentlemen clerks must be, one would suppose, somewhat distracting. That the effect of their employment in this manner upon themselves is good, appears to be more than doubtful. The best of them, I was assured, harden under the chaff to which they are almost necessarily exposed, and the soft and gentle manner which is so charming in a woman, is exchanged for an air of half-defiance, which is far from pleasing. Among the male clerks it was sad to see the number of wooden legs and maimed limbs—relics of the late terrible war.",

    "Description":"Few cities in the world can vie with New York in the beauty and convenience of its site. Occupying the triangular point of Manhattan Island, it looks seawards down a beautiful Sound, studded with islands, and it is encompassed on two of its three sides by the broad\n channel, known as the East River, which separates it from Brooklyn and Long Island, and by the lordly Hudson, which divides it from the City and State of New Jersey. The city being thus placed has this peculiarity, that it can grow at one end only. Its situation, moreover, on the eastern coast, has had effect in making New York less characteristically American than any of the other large cities. New York is cosmopolitan in its inhabitants and in its appearance, and may be described as resembling a portion of Wapping, or the dock-end of Liverpool, mixed up with streets of a semi-Parisian character. In no other city does squalor and tawdry magnificence appear in closer combination. Yet, after all, New York is a great, and withal a fine city, and if it were only kept clean, and had a tolerable system of street locomotion, and an efficient police, it would be the pleasantest residence in the New World. As it is, one would suppose there was no local government whatsoever. The commonest conveniences of the people are utterly disregarded. Even Broadway, one of the finest thoroughfares in the world, is full of unprotected traps, cellars, and areas. The squares, even in the best part of the town, such as Union Square and Madison Square, are untidy, ill-kept, strewed with dirty bits of paper, and fitted either with small round stools or narrow rails, instead of comfortable seats with backs. But municipal incapacity culminates at the Battery. This is an open space of ground, beautifully situated, at the extreme point of the triangle on which the city is built, washed on two sides by the waves, and commanding an exquisite view of Brooklyn, Jersey City, Staten Island, and the Sound. Formerly this splendid site was laid out with grass and trees; now the grass has disappeared, most of the trees have been destroyed, and the whole place “has been degraded to the level of a colossal dustheap on one side, and mouldering reminiscences of vegetation on the other.”* Added to this, it is the undisturbed resort of the vilest scum of the rabble of New York. “Castle Garden,” upon the Battery, is now an emigrant depôt, and this institution has the object of protecting newly arrived emigrants from the violence and extortion of the ruffians who waylay them on their landing.",

    "Description":"Ottawa, the new capital of the Dominion, is situated on a hill between the rivers Rideau and Ottawa, which last river here forms the boundary of the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, or, as they were formerly called, Upper and Lower Canada. It is a strange, though beautiful place, surrounded by dark pineforests and gleaming rivers, with the clear air everlastingly resounding with the rush and roar of falling waters. The town is at present small, but it is rapidly increasing. The new Parliament Buildings are erected on the extremity of a lofty promontory of black rock, partially draped with trees, and descending abruptly into the eddying Ottawa. With the Government Offices they form an extremely imposing and picturesque mass of buildings, and are a credit to the great country of which they form the principal ornament. They are in the transition Romanesque style, with irregular towers and pinnacles, some of which are surmounted by spires covered with shingles , so to say, of shining tin. The Houses of Assembly for the upper and lower branches of Legislature form the principal mass of building, and on either side, but disconnected with the central pile, are the Government Offices, the whole forming three sides of a vast square. The isolation of the side buildings seems to me to be a great mistake, as it deprives the group of the dignity it would otherwise have possessed. When the grounds in front are laid out, it will probably seem needful to connect the sides with the centre by stone terraces and flights of steps, or, better still, by a cloister. Immediately behind the Houses of Parliament is a circular library, somewhat on the plan of the Glastonbury Abbey Kitchen, but at present unfinished. Behind this is a steep precipice down to the river. The view from this point is beautiful. Below, the Ottawa whirls in swift eddies as it rushes down from the noble falls of the Chaudière, above which extend gleaming reaches of broad river, set in dark forests and divided by pine-clad islets. Below, and on either side the falls, are enormous stacks of yellow pine-lumber waiting to be floated down the stream, with innumerable saw-mills for cutting tip the timber, turned by the water. The two Canadas are here connected by a suspension-bridge, which joins Lower Ottawa with the village of Hull. Looking down the river, the mouth of the River Gatineau is seen upon the Lower Canada side, and beyond the river, pine-forests extend across an undulating plain to the very top of the hills which form a portion of the Laurencian Chain, and bound the view. On the eastern side of the Parliament House, there is a deep gully occupied by a canal. It is intended to span this gully with a fine bridge of stone, and to lay out the ground, upon either side, park-wise. The Houses of Legislature inside are extremely handsome. The chambers have stained-glass windows, but are light and cheerful. The House of Commons is decidedly handsomer than that at Westminster, but, as in that august chamber, the acoustic properties are bad. The great beauty, after all, of this noble pile is that, unlike the cold, staring, precisional Capitol at Washington, it is in thorough harmony with the surrounding scenery. Few things in the world are more striking than the sight of its towers and spires gleaming out from the surrounding woods.",

    "Description":"The City of Montreal is beautifully situated upon the St. Lawrence, here more than a mile and a half wide, from whose banks it ascends to the wooded and rocky hill from which it btained its modern name. It is in all respects a noble and beautiful city. Its streets are wide, and many of its shops and warehouses vie in size and architecture with the finest of those at New York, while in point of cleanliness no city in the United States, save, perhaps, Baltimore and some of the New England towns, can be compared with it. A magnificent quay, with well-built stone walls, extends the whole length of the city along the banks of the St. Lawrence, unmarred by the English and American selfishness of private wharfs. From this quay a fine view is obtained of the unrivalled Victoria Bridge above, and of the beautiful St. Helen's Island below, and of the wooded banks and distant mountains on the opposite side of the river. The Roman Cathedral of Notre Dame is situated in a pretty square off St. James's Street, the principal street of the town. Its great size and twin towers, despite its contemptible architecture, make it a somewhat imposing object in a general view of the city, but its interior in point of ugliness and vile taste probably exceeds any other church in the world. It is filled with yellow, rented pews, and has two tiers of galleries on either side the nave and at the entrance end, while the floor is on a steep inclined plane the wrong way, that is, it descends from the entrance down to the high or rather low altar! The decorations are only remarkable for tawdry meanness....A walk of less than a mile behind the city brings one to the summit of the Montreal “mountain,” as the inhabitants call it, the tree-clad, rocky height, which gave to the city the name of “Montreal,” instead of the ancient Indian name of Hochelaga. The view from this hill is splendid. Below, at its base, lies the city, with its many spires and noble quays; then the broad St. Lawrence, and then a vast and gently rising plain extends far as the eye can reach, dotted with villages, the shining tin spires of whose churches gleam with indescribable brightness from amidst the gloom of encircling pine-woods. At times isolated hill-ridges of mountain form, or a solitary rounded hill arises from the plain, and far away to the left are descried the distant mountains of Vermont. Seen from this elevated spot, this part of Canada seems, indeed, to be a pleasant place and a “goodly heritage.” The great Victoria Bridge, perhaps the chef-d'æuvre of Robert Stevenson, crosses the St. Lawrence about a mile from Montreal. Exclusive of the approaches, which extend some distance into the river, it is said to be a mile and a half long. As is well known, it is tubular in construction. Railway-trains alone are permitted to pass through it, but the selfishness which prevented the formation of at least a foot-way on the top must ever be matter for regret. Wonderful as a triumph of engineering skill, its straight lines, which impede the view up-stream, nevertheless render it an ugly object from the city.",

    "Description":"The first view of the fortress and city is very imposing. The St. Lawrence comes sweeping down between high, rocky, and wooded banks, and then suddenly expands into a deep bay to double its usual width. At the point of expansion the heights are crowned by the citadel and other fortifications, under which part of the city nestles at the brink of the river. The ascent is steeper, barer, and grander than that of Ehrenbreitstein, to which it bears some slight resemblance, while the huge tidal river, bearing on its bosom stately ocean ships, is in every way nobler and more beautiful than the much-belauded Rhine. The city itself is close-cribbed, dirty, and mean enough. The streets are narrow and the buildings low, commonly of only two stories, with dormer windows in the roof. The Provincial House of Assembly is an abject building of yellowish brick, and the University, built of blue-stone, resembles a hideous range of barracks. The Roman Cathedral is a poor edifice enough, but has a certain old-world look of Frenchified picturesqueness which is not unpleasing. Inside there is no central aisle, but it is always open and looks used. The Bishop's seat is on the south side. The Anglican Cathedral, externally, precisely resembles an engine-house. I failed, after several efforts, to get inside, the usual Anglican exclusiveness and dread of private prayer keeping the church locked. It is disheartening to find our national shortcomings reproduced upon the other side of the Atlantic. Near this Cathedral, on the brink of the precipice, is a magnificent terrace, which is the favourite promenade of the inhabitants. From this, as more especially from the angle of the Citadel above, a view of singular beauty is obtained.",

    "Description":"From Portland I went to Boston, by way of Portsmouth, Newbury Port, and Salem. At Boston I was received with never-failing American hospitality and kindness by a friend whom I had known in Egypt. Boston is, for the United States, an old-fashioned-looking city. The houses are chiefly built of red brick, and the streets are of a somewhat labyrinthine character. This, however, is a great relief, after the smug formality of other American cities. I visited, of course, the inevitable Bunker's Hill, which is a kind of bank, surmounted by a granite obelisk, in commemoration of the engagement in which the Colonial forces were defeated! I confess to looking myself upon the events of the revolutionary war with the most complete equanimity of mind. The actors were all Englishmen , and if the English at home took one view, and the English abroad took another, they were all English still, and whatever credit attached to the successful party may be fairly claimed as a matter for congratulation by ourselves at the present day. The view from the summit of the obelisk is of singular beauty and interest. The prospect is bounded by the Atlantic, and immediately below lies the city, with its many towers and spires rising up from the red dwellings, permeated by numerous creeks and channels, and built partly upon islands. Seen from this elevation, Boston looks like a New World Venice. Inland, across the causeway, over the River Charles, lies Cambridge, with the trees of the University of Harvard. While I was on the summit of the obelisk I was joined by a ragged boy of about sixteen or seventeen years of age, who was accompanied by a tawdry-looking girl of perhaps sixteen. On descending, I found he had inscribed his name in the visitors' book as “Dash Dash, Esquire, and Lady. ” Such is “Republican simplicity!” Near the City Hall is a statue of Franklin, which is better than most of the public monuments in America. The Capitol overlooks a beautiful green or park.",

    "Description":"Hartford is, beyond doubt, one of the pleasantest towns in the United States. It is situated in the rich valley of the beautiful Connecticut River, and the heights above the town command a wide-spread prospect of rich, peaceful, well-cultivated plains, varied by swelling hills crowned with wood, and dotted with towns, villages, and smiling homesteads. The country around Hartford is indeed a very “garden of the Lord,” and the “lines” of those who dwell therein have indeed “fallen in pleasant places.” The Library of the State House contains some curious historical documents and autographs, including correspondence between Connecticut and the Kings of England and their Ministers. Here I was shown the original charter granted by Charles II. to Connecticut, and hidden for long in the “Charter Oak,” and copies of some of the original severe and cruel laws of the old Puritans....Hartford boasts of a beautifully kept public park, in the upper part of which are the buildings of the Episcopal College of the Holy Trinity. The Library of a Literary and Philosophical Society contains the first telegram that ever was despatched. A young lady was asked to write it, and wrote the appropriate sentiment: “What hath God wrought!” During my visit the singing birds of passage made their appearance in Mr. Jewell's pleasant garden, and I had the pleasure of hearing the mellow notes of the Bobolink and the cheerful song of the American Robin, a bird somewhat bigger than a thrush. Just outside Hartford on the river bank stands the enormous revolver factory or armoury of the late Col. Colt. The present firm, at the time of my visit, were executing an order for 30,000 rifles for the Russian Government. Here I saw some of the many-barrelled Gatling Field-guns in course of construction, and a kind of portable field-battery, in which a number of barrels placed side by side could be discharged at once. Colt's Armoury is surmounted by a great azure-coloured cupola studded with gold stars. Hard-by Mrs. Colt has erected an exquisite little Episcopal Church for the use of the men employed in the works.",

    "Description":"A Couple of miles or so from Boston, across the causeway over the River Charles, in the suburban town of Cambridge, is a large expanse of grass, which, in some sort, resembles one of the “Greens” in the neighbourhood of London, as, for instance, that of Hampton. Dotted about this grassy plain, with no particular regularity, are a number of buildings of varying degrees of ugliness, some built of old red brick, others of new greyish stone, but all of a formal and sombre character. These buildings make up the celebrated University or College of Harvard, which vies with Yale in claiming to be the first educational institution in the United States. Harvard University was founded in the year A. D. 1638, by the Rev. John Harvard, an alumnus of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, England, who, himself a Puritan, designed the College he founded for the promulgation of Puritan doctrines. The motto chosen for the College was “ Christo et 310 Ecclesiæ. ” At the present time Harvard University is governed by a President, five Fellows, a Treasurer, some thirty elective Overseers, and a large staff of Professors. Under these there are about a thousand Undergraduate Students, divided into Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen. The majority of the Undergraduates at the present time come from Massachusetts, or, at all events, from the New England States, Western and Southern youths generally preferring Yale. Upon presenting themselves for admission candidates are compelled to pass a matriculation examination, and before this are obliged to act the farce of producing testimonials of a good moral character, and when admitted must give a bond for 400 dollars to pay all charges accruing under the laws and customs of the University. “The bond must be executed by two bondsmen, who must be satisfactory to the steward of the College, and one of them must be a citizen of Massachusetts.” Some of the students reside in the town of Cambridge in lodgings, approved by the faculty, but a large number are accommodated in the several college buildings, which are, with one exception, termed Halls, and are named respectively College House, Divinity Hall, Gray's Hall, Hollis Hall, Holworthy Hall, Stoughton Hall, and Massachusetts Hall. Of these Massachusetts Hall is the oldest, and was used as barracks in the Revolutionary war. The men's rooms resemble those of an Oxford or Cambridge College, save that it is usual for two students to chum together and occupy the same apartment. Wine and spirituous liquors of all sorts are prohibited in the lodgings and College rooms—a piece of Puritan repression which is easily and often evaded; and the rowdyism of a bar-room outside not unfrequently takes the place of the cosy “wine” of a few intimate friends in that snuggest of snuggeries the “rooms” of an Oxford man. Of University discipline there is but little. There is no Proctorial surveillance; the students may come in and go out when they please, and so long as they are present at the dull and strictly enforced chapel service, can practically sleep at Boston or wherever else they please. All undergraduates, without exception, are required to attend daily morning chapel, as they are also on Sundays, unless, at the special request of their parents or guardians, they are allowed to attend other congregations in Cambridge or elsewhere.",

    "Description":"About two hours' railway journey, or fifty-two miles above New York, along the banks of the Hudson, and exactly at the most beautiful point of that beautiful river, stands the celebrated Military Academy of West Point. The scenery around is charming in the extreme. Lofty hills, only just lower than mountains, come sweeping down in graceful curves to the noble Hudson, whose deep and eddying stream is enlivened by the constant passage of huge river steamers, and flecked with the white sails of sea-going ships. Rocky and tree draped islands raise their crests every here and there from the water, and pyramidal cypresses, with their dark foliage, lift themselves up amongst the woods of deciduous trees which line the steep and craggy banks. The buildings of the Academy, which are built of stone, occupy a lofty situation, and command a noble view up the river to the city of Newburg, and to the Catskill Mountains, with their swelling outline and “sleepy hollows.” In front of the College is a fine parade-ground of beautifully-kept grass, upon a natural plateau. Upon one side of this is a line of pretty villas, tenanted by the officers and professors of the Academy, and on the other side, and in front, the ground descends steeply to the river through the woods. The slopes are everywhere permeated by winding walks; some high up, and others on the very brink of the Hudson; and these, and especially “Flirtation Walk,” are as delightful as any that the world can show. In places, mock-batteries and trenches, for the instruction of the cadets, are erected upon commanding spots, but these are not allowed in any case to interfere with the beauty and picturesqueness of the natural scenery. Trees either grow naturally; or are planted exactly where they ought to grow, the grass is, for a wonder, smooth and well-kept, seats are abundant, and the place, altogether, has about it an air of cultivated taste and civilization, which can be found nowhere else in the States. West Point is essentially a gentlemanly place. The cadets are lodged in a large stone building or barracks of a somewhat imposing appearance, and the mess-room, chapel and library, are detached buildings. The library is a fine and cheerful room, and contains a few portraits of eminent officers educated in the Academy, but the collection of books does not appear to be very large. In the chapel a number of old brass guns, taken in the\n Revolutionary war, are let into the walls, and flags and other trophies are suspended\n at regular intervals. I confess that I viewed these trophies without a single pang. I am\n convinced that the separation of the States was for the happiness both of the old country\n and of the 332 separating colonies, and, in respect of the trophies, they were, after all, only\n taken by one set of Englishmen from another.",

    "Description":"On the afternoon of my arrival I ‘did’ the Central Park of New York—an immense place, ever so many miles long, and very well kept; called ‘Central’ because it is a long way off. Parks are very much the fashion in America; now almost every great town has a fine park. A long stream of carriages of all kinds was going towards the park, but they tailed off and became rare in the further parts. I noticed even on Sunday a large number of vehicles going out there; but I am told that these are chiefly filled by the foreign population of New York, which is very large. I should say that the park is a kind of cross between Regent's Park and the Bois de Boulogne. In the evening everything seemed very dull. There are no books in the hotels; the streets are but indifferently lighted, and nothing seemed to be going on. There was none of the liveliness of a great European city in the evening. The following day I looked about the town, and delivered some letters of introduction, being very kindly received by some very agreeable people. That evening I dined with a very pleasant and hospitable old banker, who struck me as wonderfully English in his manners and conversation as well as in his table and arrangements. I was much surprised to find that he had never been in Europe—which is a rare thing—but he had been very much in contact with Englishmen. The appearance of the city of New York did not strike me as being very different from European cities. There are some fine buildings, but I should not say that the place impresses one very much. Upon the whole it is less un-English-looking than I expected. The principal points in New York ways which struck me were the following:—The way of serving the dishes, the cookery, the food, and the arrangements altogether at the hotels. The rectangular streets, which one soon learns to find a great convenience, the number of the street giving you at once the clue to its whereabouts. Then the vehicles used, which are different from ours. The ladies' carriages are not very different; they are not particularly smart nor well set up—the fine ladies are generally content with coachmen, without footmen. But the light traps and everything that goes under the name of ‘buggy’ in America are very smart and fast vehicles indeed, with a great many fast-trotting horses. I was taken by surprise to find that the spider-like vehicles which we rather suppose to be an American eccentricity are in every-day use, not only in the towns but still more in the country and over the unmade country roads. They are made of hickory-wood, are wonderfully light, and seem to be exceedingly strong, judging by the work which they endure. They last quite as well as our heavy vehicles, and I cannot imagine why we do not follow the example in getting such-like traps.",

    "Description":"As we got on the country became somewhat better, but still a dead flat, with a great deal of marsh, and many of the houses built on piles. The lake was quite smooth: there were no waves beyond ripples. We duly arrived at Chicago. The railway station was burnt down in the great fire, and has not been rebuilt. The town, though still showing a good many blanks, has been rebuilt in a wonderful way, and is undoubtedly a very fine one, but rather dirty and smoky—not clean, like the Eastern cities, where they burn anthracite coal. The whole country about is a dead level. The town is laid out on, I think, rather too great a scale; the distances are very great. Outside each quarter is a great park. I went to the Grand Pacific Hotel—not the largest, but it seems very good and well situated, and I was comfortable there. I made the acquaintance of Mr. A—, the President of the Illinois Central Railway, who gave me much assistance; and I found one or two friends whom I had before met on my travels, and who were very kind to me. I spent the day in thoroughly doing the town. I went to one of the great pig-killing establishments. It certainly was a wonderful sight. They kill and dispose of 8,000 pigs per diem. It takes three or four days to convert the pigs into bacon, but they are really made into sausages in the course of an hour. The bacon is put into railway cars in layers, without any further packing, and so sent to the Eastern States. I drove round the parks, which are not quite complete, and may be called the parks of the future; but they are very well and handsomely laid out. There is a pleasant villa suburb called Hyde Park. Most of the Western cities have a ‘Hyde Park. Here also there was an exhibition going on, which I went to see. American-made goods seemed to preponderate, the agricultural machinery, as usual, very prominent. I went to see one of the great elevators by which grain is raised by machinery, stored, and shipped. It must be understood that the elevator in America is not a mere machine for transferring the grain from one conveyance to another, but is, in fact, a great warehouse, where grain is stored sometimes for months, especially on the great lakes, where, owing to the suspension of traffic in the winter, it must often be kept for a considerable period in store. The system seems to be one under which a man does not necessarily receive back his own grain, but only a like quantity of grain of the same grade. I was not quite able to understand the nature of the interference exercised, but I found that at Chicago, and I believe at most American commercial centres, the produce brought to market is examined by official inspectors, who class the grain, and apparently nothing is allowed to be sold without being officially classed.",

    "Description":"We passed many villages and small towns. The people at some of these places seemed primitive enough. After running through a considerable belt of wood we came to the Mississippi, with the city of St. Louis on the opposite side, and crossed by the great bridge, a very fine structure. I went to the Lindell Hotel, a fine and large one. My first day at St. Louis was a Sunday, and I noticed there that, although the people seemed very religious and church-going, they were somewhat Continental in their views of Sunday. Here and at other places I saw the eternal American game of base-ball being played on Sunday. There was a boat-race; and the Exhibition grounds (here, as everywhere, an agricultural exhibition was going on) were very full of people, the Sunday notwithstanding. All over America shops are closed on Sunday, as with us; but they seem to have no shutters to the windows, so that they have not the same closed appearance. I stayed at St. Louis long enough to have a good look about the town. There seemed to be many fine buildings, but I should say it is hardly so pretentious as Chicago. However, it is almost as large, with very long streets running out into the country, and a large park. I noticed in the St. Louis papers that in this State of Missouri parties are so divided that the negro vote seems to be of consequence. The question of mixed or separate schools seems to be an important one here, and the advocates of mixed schools hope to secure the votes of the blacks. I went down to have a good look at the Mississippi, that great river of America, and I was certainly disappointed. After having seen other great rivers I was not particularly struck with this one. It may be larger than the others, but the size is not palpable; the breadth is not excessive, and there is no appearance of a very strong current. According to the register it is now seven feet above low water level, which, I suppose, is rather low. The Mississippi and Missouri join a few miles above this. The water looks muddy. It is a curious thing that there seem to be no good fish in the Mississippi. There are no river-fish in the hotel bills; those that they have come over from the great lakes or from the sea. I asked about it, and they said only a few inferior fish, called cat-fish, are caught in the Mississippi.",

    "Description":"I stayed at Kansas City, which, by the way, is not in Kansas State at all, but in Missouri, on the borders of Kansas. There were many vehicles of all sorts, well horsed. Everyone seems to keep a horse; yet the price of a hack carriage is two dollars the first hour, and one dollar for every subsequent hour. The proprietors say they are obliged to take out licenses, which causes conveyances to be dear. I noticed here an ordinance against touting and soliciting custom, making it a misdemeanour. Apparently this is a municipal ordinance published by the Mayor and signed by the town clerk. The innkeepers' notice regarding liabilities for losses is a Missouri State Law (Revised Statutes of Missouri, chapter 79). Kansas City is on the Missouri River. I was very much disappointed with that river; it does not look very large. It is like an Indian river, with sandbanks in it; but I understand it does not rise so much. There are no steamers and apparently no navigation here, except a few mud-barges and small boats for local use. In fact, the river is not much used in this part of its course, but it is more used higher up, and it is navigable throughout more or less. Occasional steamers pass up, and can go up a very long way—it is scarcely known how far. The Government send steamers up by the river route for supplying their far-away outposts in the far North-West, where there are no other means of communication. Kansas City is mostly on high ground. It seems a thriving place, nothing very remarkable about it, and is quite modern in its ways. I should not have known I was so far West. My hotel was the St. James's, on high ground, comfortable and moderate. I found that no paper is published on Monday morning, and I asked, ‘Why, are people too good to print upon Sunday?’ The answer I got was, ‘No, but they drink upon Sunday.’ However, I did not see much of that, and rather think that my informant was unduly severe on his countrymen. In the afternoon I visited the stock-yards, and then went on the Kansas side of the small river which here divides the two States. There were many cattle in the yards, and most of them seemed to be very well-bred animals—not very fat, but tolerably so. I understand that they will go to the American butchers at once. The greater number come from Texas, many also from Colorado. The cattle raised in Colorado are said to be the best-bred. Much good short-horn blood has, I believe, been introduced of late years. The cattle come here by rail. There is no grazing-ground along which they could be driven for two or three hundred miles from this. They are driven from Texas up to the railway, and then trucked. These railways have certainly led to the cultivation and civilisation of the country in a marvellous degree. Where a few years ago all was uncultivated and barbarous now things are almost as civilised as in an English town, to say the least. The bad spirits who hover on the borders of civilisation have gone farther West. To see the real West one must go much farther than Kansas City; but as my inquiries lie chiefly in another direction I have not gone farther.",

    "Description":"Pittsburgh is a very smoky-looking place; but it is surrounded by pretty hills, on some of which are vineyards, and altogether the scene looks a good deal like a European Continental town, the smoke apart. My guide-book directed me to the Union Depôt Hotel, but I found it had been burnt down in last year's riots, and I went to the Seventh Avenue Hotel. The next day was Sunday, and it struck me that Pittsburgh was a singularly dull and uninteresting place on that day; nothing seemed to be going on. The people seem respectable enough; but very many men of various sorts were hanging about the streets in a moody kind of way. I can easily imagine it to be the sort of place for an outbreak like that which occurred last year. However, at present the place is as full of women and children as other places, and one sees wonderfully few signs of last year's destruction. The more I walk about the place the more smoky and grimy and dull-looking it seems to be. I observe many negroes about, many of the women in smart Sunday dresses. The relations between them and the whites appear quite good. The next day a gentleman connected with the Pennsylvania Central Railway was kind enough to drive me about the town and show me some of the sights. I now learned that there was a special reason for the extreme dullness and want of motion yesterday. It seems that a great Sunday-closing movement has just broken out, an old Act of 1794 having been put in force against the publicans, or saloon-keepers, as they are called in America; and they in turn have put in force the law against everyone else. Almost all the street-cars were stopped and every sort of traffic. The saloon-keepers have established a ‘Detective Association’ to deal with Sunday-breakers, and are now the great promoters of the closing movement, which is the great question of the day. There used to be very many saloons and much drinking in Pittsburgh; but ‘Murphy’ has been very active lately, and is said to have had a great effect. He is here now. I am afraid it seems inconsistent with what I have said in detraction of the Pittsburgh people, but I am told that this is a very Presbyterian and Scotch-Irish place. Before the war many negroes took refuge here, but it is said there are hardly so many of them now as there were then. This is a great railway centre. A very inconvenient peculiarity of American freedom is the great variety of railway gauges, which gives much trouble in regard to the through lines; but they have got over this difficulty by a system of hoisting the carriages off one set of wheels and putting them on another. This is very rapidly done; and in this way, notwithstanding change of gauge, carriages are run through for long distances. There is a very large traffic between this 243 place and Lake Erie. Ironstone is brought in large quantities from the Lake regions. We visited one of the largest ironworks.",

    "Description":"In the morning I looked about Philadelphia. Like all other American cities it is very rectangular, but some of the streets are more European-looking and better filled than any I had yet seen in America. Chestnut and Walnut and such-like streets run between the Delaware and the Schuylkill rivers, and at right angles to them run the numbered streets. The Delaware is not here a very large river; there is a tide, but the water is fresh, it being a long way from the sea. There is said to be not less water in the river than over the New York Bar; but the disadvantage is that the shallow places are more numerous, and it takes longer to pass all of them. Evidently the port is at some disadvantage in this respect. Some of the larger steamers do not care to come up. In regard to the grain trade Philadelphia is much pressed by Baltimore; there is great rivalry between the two places. I went to see Independence House and several other sights. Mr. B—, a countryman of mine, to whom I had an introduction, was good enough to drive me about in the afternoon. He took me through the famous Fairmount Park. A very fine large park it is. The site of the Centennial Exhibition was in this park, and certainly a very commanding and good site. Beyond the park both sides of a pretty stream have been taken up for a continuation of the drive, making it altogether eleven miles in length. The country here is not hilly, but undulating and pretty.",

    "Description":"In the afternoon I started for Baltimore. We passed through a pleasant country, with many houses on the banks of the river. It was dark before we reached Baltimore. The general aspect of the place seemed to be, that in the lower parts land and water were very much intermixed. At Baltimore I stopped at the Mount Vernon Hotel. It is kept on the European and not on the American plan, and seemed nice, but on experience I was a good deal disappointed with it. They say that this European fashion does not suit people here, and that the hotel, which was once good, is not now well maintained. Comparing the harbour here with that of Philadelphia and other places, I am told that the United States Government undertake the charge of rivers, harbours, and works of internal navigation. They have made some bad essays in that line in Pennsylvania, and the system altogether leads to a good deal of jobbing. I am inclined to prefer our own system, under which each town and municipality undertakes its own improvements.... Here in Baltimore they have some branches of industry very much to themselves, notably caulking ships and brick-making. They have, I am told, a ship-caulking company composed entirely of coloured men, and managed by coloured men. I was sorry that in my stay here I did not manage to see something of this company, for this is the only case of which I have heard where black men have successfully managed anything of the kind. They do not own much land, I am told, but they work well on the land in the country about here, as well as in domestic service. They form about a fourth of the population here. I had a curious account of their Freemason and other societies. Freemason lodges are believed to have existed among them even in the days of slavery, unknown to their masters. The system is said to have been brought from the British colonies; and the Freemasonry among them was, I am told, made very evident during the war.",

    "Description":"The country between Baltimore and Washington seemed poor and uninteresting; in fact, they say it is one of the poorest parts of the United States. The entrance to Washington is through a poor part of the town. The Capitol is very conspicuous; from a distance it looks like St. Peter's at Rome. When we get well into the town it improves very much indeed; very fine, wide avenues have been laid out, radiating from central points; and there are some fine streets. The place was laid out by Washington himself in his capacity of engineer and surveyor. It seems that he had great ideas of the future, and a sort of mania for broad streets and magnificent designs. The accounts I heard of him remind me of our engineer-soldier, Lord Napier of Magdala. Washington meant the principal part of the city to be on the side where it is not now, but land speculators took up the land and ran up the prices so high that people built on what he meant to be the back part of the town; that is now the City of Washington, with the Capitol, as it were, looking away from it. Some modern Americans grumble about the width of the Washington streets, and say that the vastness of the place dwarfs the buildings. I must say that I think Washington was quite right. In this climate, where trees grow easily, broad avenues are very effective and pleasing; and although the City of Washington was for upwards of half a century a complete failure, and until a few years ago was not at all successful, it has made immense strides of late years, and now, to my taste, is by far the best city in America. It is not only well laid out, handsome, and clean, but it has that which is altogether wanting in all other places in America that I have seen, viz., good pavement. All the principal avenues and streets are laid down with excellent asphalte pavement; so that instead of being the worst it is the best-paved town in the world that I know; that is, so far as the principal streets go. There are a number of very fine public buildings, many of them of superb granite and marble.",

Reading the local papers in the evening, I saw that most of the seats in Congress for this State are contested. I did not see evidence of any great bitterness. In the papers I noticed an account of a local county meeting for Wayne County—not a popular meeting, but only of the County Commissioners, who are five in number. The subjects seemed very like those dealt with by our Local Boards. I remarked the following:—The poor-house and paupers; the county gaol; roads and bridges, and apportionment of labour—in these States the inhabitants are bound to work on the roads on the system which used to be called ‘Statute labour’ in Scotland—; spirit licences; valuation of property; registration of voters; arrangement of school districts; appointment of a local constable on a casual vacancy. It is mentioned that there are nine paupers in the poor-house—four white and five coloured—and then there is a notice of small allowances granted to out-paupers....The town of Raleigh is, as usual, very scattered, with broad streets quite unpaved, and a good deal of ornamental ground about the houses. The population of the place is about 12,000. The Capitol is a fine building, in a commanding situation. I noticed a very large lunatic asylum, and there seemed to be a good many other institutions. There are many whiskey shops, and a good many churches. The cotton market is very busy; the general market seems well supplied. The most common fish in these parts are what are called sea-trout; but I do not think that they are our sea-trout, and they do not seem very good. I am told that in the streams in the hill-country there is very abundant trout-fishing.",

My black friend attributes the injury to Columbia to the Confederates, but does not put it in an unreasonably wicked light. The town seems now to have very much recovered from the destruction. It has been much rebuilt, and looks very well. Many of the best houses were built by the carpet-bag officials. The Capitol seems a fine building; all the public offices are in it, as is usually the case. There are wide grassy streets lined with good trees, many of them magnolias and other southern plants. The houses have pretty grounds about them, and I notice some particularly thriving deodars. The situation of the town is pretty, upon a considerable river. The country about is very well wooded, and the woods are now beautifully coloured, the autumnal tints being at their best. I notice several varieties of fir trees. Cows graze freely about on the grassy avenues. There are several iron works here, where they make small engines and do other such work. It is remarkable how the iron trade seems to be developing throughout the States. I understand that in all these works except one, they employ exclusively white labour. There are no mills on the fine river here, but there is a small canal which it is proposed to enlarge as a State work in the hope of establishing mills. Apparently, there is not in this State the prohibition against undertaking public works which has recently been put into the Constitution of a good many States.",

    "Description":"The steamer landed me at Beaufort. It is a remarkably nice-looking place, with good hotels and many comforts. I went to the Sea Island Hotel, and was comfortable there. The town seems very pleasant and cheerful, with no signs whatever of the tyranny of black rule. It is one of the oldest settlements in America. When it was the centre of a slave population it was used as a summer residence by the neighbouring planters, who had nice houses here. These planters are described as having been very good gentlemanfarmers; they were well educated, and were especially fond of good libraries. In the early part of the war Beaufort was occupied by Federal troops, and many negroes congregated under their protection. Several of the black regiments which were raised by the Federals were stationed here. Being so occupied, the place escaped destruction and plunder, and that is why it is so well preserved. It now seems pretty prosperous, with good stores, cotton-ginning mills, phosphate dealers, and so on; but the old race of planters is gone or dispersed. Many of the houses are occupied by their widows and daughters, in a sadly impoverished condition. A good deal of long cotton comes in, grown in a small way by negroes, but nothing like what there was before. The great majority of the population of the town, and almost all the population of the surrounding country, are black; so that the Democrats have found it impossible to wrest this one county from the Radicals, who still elect the county officers and send members to the State Assembly; but the Democrats have succeeded in conquering the Congressional district. The houses are surrounded by orange-trees and pleasant vegetation, but they are not so well painted and neat as they used to be. Many of them were sold for arrears of taxes; and a good many of the smaller ones are occupied by blacks, who have thus much better quarters than they usually have. Some land in the neighbourhood is still owned by whites, but most of it by blacks, who purchased it after the tax sales. Everything seems in order; there is no squatting without title, but some of the titles are incomplete, the instalments of purchase-money not having been made good. The blacks cannot have a better chance than they have here, and I am very anxious to know how they are getting on.",

    "Description":"At daylight in the morning we were passing through a flattish country, with much cotton cultivation, and soon afterwards we reached Augusta, in Georgia. Augusta is handsomely laid out, with broad boulevards and houses surrounded by beautiful shrubs and trees. It must be charming in fine weather; but to-day, for the first time during my tour, it is raining heavily, and I had an opportunity of appreciating the mud of an unpaved American town. I am told, too, that before the rain the place was very dusty. This is a great cotton mart—the centre of a large cotton-growing country. The only complaint is, that the farmers grow cotton too exclusively, and do not rotate enough, or grow food enough for themselves, but have to buy largely from the West. Augusta is on the River Savannah, which gives an immense water-power, the fall being rapid, the stream strong, and the supply constant and unfailing. Advantage has been taken of this to establish great cottonmills, which are doing a large and prosperous business. The stock of the mills is at a premium. At a very large mill which I visited they make only coarse unbleached goods, using only very low numbers of yarn; but at another mill close by they make finer goods, the yarns used being, I was told, about No. 22. It is said that, while in other parts of the States millowners are losing, these Southern mills make large profits. Three-fourths of the goods go to New York, as the commercial emporium. The labour employed is entirely white, and is upon what they call the ‘family system,’ which is much the same as the English system, as opposed to the New England practice, where the mill-girls live in great barracks. Here they have workmen's houses near the mills, much like what one sees in England. The manager says that the people work quite as well as Northern mill-workers of whom he has had experience. There are good schools in the town, and most of the people are now fairly educated; but there is no compulsory school law, direct or indirect, and no restriction as regards the work of children. The women earn from $3 to $5 a week, fifty cents a day being the wages for common hands. They are very regular and wellbehaved. Some men work well too, but they are not so good as the women. They work eleven hours a day. By the way, I may mention that I have met some people who speak rather in a depreciatory way of the morals of the charming young ladies who do the millwork in New England factories; but I have not visited these latter, and cannot say whether this is a libel. No blacks are employed in the mills here. The manager says they are not ‘responsible.’ He has not tried them—perhaps they might do well enough under superintendence. Before the war there were, I understand, several small mills successfully worked by slaves.",

It is now a great railway centre and a prosperous place; but, as I am to remain here some days, I am disappointed to find that it is not at all a pretty or nice town; very inferior in amenities to all the other Southern towns I have seen. It is, in fact, a new brick-built town, with no trees in the streets, but abundant mud, for there is now a good deal of rain. As in all American towns, there are some nice enough villa suburbs, but there is no river or open ground near. The principal hotel, the Kimball, is crammed full, and I had difficulty in getting in. It is a fine large establishment, with a great hall in the centre, which is immensely crowded. I have here realised for the first time what American spitting is. It really requires some nerve to walk across the hall. This is about the busiest season of the year for the cotton traffic and mercantile business generally, besides that the Legislature is in session. I understand that the climate of this elevated region is very good. At present, on account of clouds and rain, it is rather warm and muggy for the season of the year.",

    "Description":"New York Bay is one of the most extensive harbours in the world. As you steam into it, you pass between Staten and Long Islands, with pretty villas dotted along their shores and hillsides; then on passing several forts, the great city is before you. It seems as if floating on the water. It reminded me much of the descriptions of Constantinople, only its great dome is not the mosque of St. Sophia, but the Post Office; its “cloud-capped towers” are the spires of newspaper offices, and its “gorgeous palaces” are hotels and dry goods stores. “Forests of masts,” yachts and sail boats, innumerable steamers, and ferry-boats flitting about in all directions at once show what a busy hive it is. NEW YORK is built on Manhattan Island, which is thirteen and a half miles long, with an average breadth of one and a half miles, forming an area of 22 square miles. It is bounded on the east by East River, and on the west by the river Hudson. The city proper is compactly built for about six miles from Battery Point. Two hundred years ago it had a thousand, now it has one million inhabitants. To the east is Brooklyn with 300,000 inhabitants, and to the west is Jersey City with 85,000. These three virtually constitute one great city. The distance across the Hudson between New York and Jersey City is about one mile and a quarter. At the narrowest part of East River, between New York and Brooklyn, a great suspension bridge, 533 yards span, with towers 268 feet high, has been in course of construction since 1870; some think it will never be completed. This is the greatest suspension bridge ever attempted. The original estimate was £1,400,000, but competent authorities state that it will cost £24,000,000. The only means of communication with New York is by ferries, twenty-five in number. Boats ply from each every three to five minutes, and go all night at the principal ones every quarter of an hour. These ferry-boats are very large, just shaped like Noah's Ark, painted white, and the cross-beam of the engine works outside. There are rooms for the passengers on either side, and the centre is for carriages, twenty to thirty of which could, I suppose, cross in one boat. The old portion of New York is very irregularly built, just like any of our own old cities; but the new part is built in uniform square blocks, twenty to the mile. This is the plan adopted in all American cities. In New York, the streets running north and south are called Avenues —First, Second, Third, to Eleventh Avenue—and the cross streets cutting the Avenues at right angles are named First Street, Second Street, Third Street, up to One Hundred and Twentieth Street. The advantages of this system cannot be overestimated; a stranger at once knows where to go, and how far he has to go....The great thoroughfare or artery of New York is Broadway, (80 feet wide); it runs from Battery Point in a straight line through the centre of the city, then branches off in a westerly direction. It is one of the finest thoroughfares in the world. It is the great buisness street, and is lined with fine shops, offices, and large dry goods warehouses, or rather stores , as they are called. The late Mr. A. T. Stewart's retail warehouse, the largest in the world, occupies an entire block; it is six stories high, built of iron, and painted white; his wholesale store is marble. The insurance and newspaper offices are got up regardless of expense. Some of the latter have high towers, to which, I presume, the editors retreat when threatened with a horsewhipping. The houses generally have outside Venetian blinds. The signboards are a perfect study, surpassing in number and variety any attempt at advertising I had previously seen. The side streets are roughly paved; telegraph posts are stuck rudely into the streets at the edge of the pavement; trees line several streets; gaudily-painted figures of Indians and Africans taking snuff stand opposite tobacconists' shops; barbers' poles are innumerable; tramway cars run up the principal streets (except Broadway), and in two or three streets, railway trains run over your head as high as the second storey, in short, commerce is everything, and everything gives way to it. There is a total disregard for appearance or architectural effect; but withal, there is a charm in the bustle around, as you at once feel conscious that you are among an energetic, hard working, great people. The elevated railway is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen attempted in a city. Iron or wooden posts are stuck in at the edge of the pavements, and the street is arched over with cross beams as high as the second storey of the houses. On the top of these the train runs, and the traffic of the street goes on below. In narrow streets which admit only single lines, single posts are used shaped like the letter T. This mode of construction is cheaper than the underground railway in London, and is pleasanter to ride in, but it is most destructive to property. A gentleman who owns several streets told me that some of his warehouses were empty and would never let again, except at greatly reduced rents, and he got no compensation. The bill for such a railway passes, I believe, through the State Parliament. The most imposing building in the city is the Post Office, built of granite, it cost £1,400,000. The Court House is a massive marble building. It cost six millions of pounds sterling, three to four millions of which were stolen by contractors and others. The modern part of the city is well built and paved. The dwellings in the fashionable quarters are equal to the finest residences in Belgravia. The late Mr. A. T. Stewart's house in Fifth Avenue is palatial, built of white marble, and cos £400,000. Central Park, at the end of Fifth Avenue, contains 850 acres, tastefully laid out. It is 2½ miles long and half-amile wide.",

    "Description":"I then visited PHILADELPHIA. The great quaker city, founded by William Penn, covers the largest area of any city in the United States, and it is next to New York in population; the population is 800,000. The city which lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers is twenty miles long x eight wide, and contains three hundred miles of paved streets, and more houses than any city in the States. Broad Street, the longest in the city, measures twenty three miles. You must not suppose that this street is compactly built for twenty three miles; the meaning is that the municipal boundaries extend that distance. It is customary to carry the names of streets right out into the open country. Broadway runs through New York City, up the Hudson River for 150 miles, and through the city of Albany; and Yonge Street in Toronto runs more than 100 miles in a straight line. For instance, Argyle Street in Glasgow would in all probability be called Argyle Street through Dumbarton as far as Helensburgh, and the High Street of Paisley would be called High Street from Glasgow through Paisley and Howood to Beith. The site of Philadelphia is very flat. The city is substantially built, principally of brick, and white marble is extensively used for window-sills and door-steps. The majority of the streets are only about fifty feet wide, and are lined with trees. It is a great business place, and although there is considerable bustle, the tone is quieter than in New York. The first person I called on was George H. Stuart; he occupies a high place among American philanthropists. He raised enormous sums during the war, and organised the Christian Commission which did so much to alleviate the distress and smooth the pillows of thousands of poor fellows on the field of battle. Mr. Stuart delights in relating stirring incidents of the war, and shows with pride one of the little testaments he had distributed which saved a man's life. The soldier had carried it over his heart, and a bullet had pierced the book and stopped at the last board. Mr. Stuart showed me about Philadelphia. We visited the old State House, where are preserved a collection of portraits, revolutionary relics, the table on which the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, and the old liberty bell, which bears the following inscription:—“Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the people thereof.” We then went to Girard College, the leading charitable institution of the city. Stephen Girard, a banker and merchant, who died in 1831, left his large fortune for the improvement of the city and charitable purposes. The College which bears his name was built and endowed by his funds; it is a truly noble and lasting monument to his memory. In it 850 fatherless boys, between the ages of 6 and 18 years, are boarded and educated entirely free of expense, and afterwards indentured to learn a trade.",

    "Description":"Washington at present is a most ridiculous looking city. It has been called “the city of magnificent distances and intentions.” The plan is to have the Capitol in the centre, and to have avenues radiating from it all around. The avenues and streets have been laid out for a city suitable for, I should think, a million, but there are only, I believe, about 80,000 inhabitants, and only a small portion of the city has been built; the consequence is that instead of being in the centre, the Capitol is at the edge of the city facing towards open fields and unbuilt streets lined with trees. I think the city will never be built, as it has no commerce; it is merely the seat of Government. The Capitol is (many say) the largest building in the world. It is a magnificent pile 750 feet long, covers 3½ acres, and stands on rising ground tastefully laid out with shrubs and trees. A great portico of Corinthian columns adorns the entrance, and a magnificent dome similar in shape to St. Paul's in London rises 240 feet above the roof, and on the top is a figure of Liberty. The view of the Potomac and the luxuriant country around is extensive and beautiful. The main part is built of freestone, and painted pure white to the very top; the wings are marble. The spacious halls, marble staircases, statuary, and pictures are worthy of a great nation. The House of Representatives is in one end, and the Senate or Upper House occupies the other. There are galleries in each for the accommodation of 1200 to 1500 strangers. The members' seats are placed in a circular form round the rostrum, from which they address the house. Each member is provided with a spitoon and a desk on which he may write or rest his head or his heels if he chooses. The Supreme Court also sits in the Capitol.",

    "Description":"Boston , the capital of the State of Massachusetts, and I might say the capital of the New England States, is built like a crescent round the undulating shores of Massachusetts Bay. It is a beautiful city, and the most English-like of any in the States. The old part is most irregularly built, simply a maze, and although I lived there for several weeks I frequently was puzzled to find my way. A story is told of a stranger who after wandering about for some time, at last asked a policeman the way to such and such a street. “Well,” he replied, “I guess it is about time you were asking, as you have passed me seventeen times.” In the centre of the city there is a park called “the Common,” of about 100 acres, with avenues of grand old elms, and tastefully laid out flower gardens, ornamented with a few fine statues. It is surrounded by streets of splendid private residences and clubs, and at the northern end the gilded dome of the State House towers above the trees. A high granite column is erected on Bunker Hill in commemoration of the defeat of the English, on 17th June, 1775. The 17th of June is an annual holiday, all places of business were closed, and numerous militia regiments paraded the streets, and the Governor of the state reviewed them on the Common. In the great fire which broke out on Saturday evening, 9th November, 1872, and which raged with great fury till Sunday night, 60 acres of the principal business part of the city were reduced to ruins. The losses amounted to the enormous sum of £15,000,000. This portion of the city has been entirely rebuilt, and streets of magnificent warehouses have risen from the ruins. It is worth noting, that in the fire granite buildings crumbled to dust, while those of common brick stood it out. Boston is called “the Hub” (or centre of the wheel) of the Universe; it is celebrated for its literary and benevolent institutions, and the people are highly cultivated and very musical.",

    "Description":"There are now upwards of ten millions of cotton spinning spindles in America, threefourths of which are in the New England States. At Lawrence, a town on the Merrimac river (70 miles from Boston), I was shown over the Pacific Mills, the largest in the world; in them 5,300 hands are employed in the manufacture of cotton cloth and fancy dress goods of wool and cotton. This great concern consists of 12 buildings with 42 acres of flooring, and contains 135,000 cotton spindles, 25,000 worsted spindles, 4,500 looms, and 24 machines which print from one to sixteen colours. More than 1,260,000 yards of cloth are printed or dyed every week. Fifty boilers in a row supply the print-works with steam. The Merrimac river, which I think will be rather 39 more than the width of the Clyde at Glasgow Bridge, is dammed back by a weir 30 feet high, and the water is diverted into a great lade 80 feet wide, and the mills of the Pacific and other companies are supplied with water-power from it. The water-power used by the Pacific is 2300 horse, besides the engines. The mills work 60 hours a week. In going through the print-works, several of the workmen told me that they came from Leven and Thornliebank. There are six other concerns in Lawrence, manufacturing cotton and woollen goods, and all, including the Pacific Company, employ a capital of £1,600,000, over 10,000 hands, 338,000 spindles, and produce over 2,300,000 yards of cloth weekly. Thirty years ago corn grew on the site of these vast mills, but now the thriving town contains 40,000 inhabitants. The Cotton Thread Works of Messrs. J. & P. Coats, at Pawtucket (in the State of Rhode Island), 40 miles from Boston, are very extensive, and consist of three large mills standing parallel to each other. The newest mill (four stories) has the finest rooms I have ever seen —about 400 feet long by 105 feet wide; two of these flats contain 25,000 spinning spindles each. The cotton is spun from the foundation and sent out on spools; 1500 hands are employed, and the mills work 65 hours a week.",

Words cannot express the glow of delight that I had when I came in sight of the mighty St. Lawrence stretching out like a great sea. The train crosses the St. Lawrence by the Great Victoria Bridge, one of the wonders of the world, nearly 2 miles long, consisting of a series of wrought-iron tubes resting on 24 piers of masonry, the central tube being 830 feet long X 22 feet high, and 16 feet wide, it contains only a single line of rails, and the total cost was £1,300,000, It is a very inelegant structure, but a most useful one, were it not for it the direct communication between Montreal and the States would be entirely cut off. On leaving the bridge, Montreal bursts on your view. The situation of the city could not be surpassed; it rises gradually from the great river, and a richly wooded hill similar in shape to Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh rises abruptly behind the city. This hill has been converted into a public park, and from it is obtained one of the grandest views imaginable. My joy was great at landing in Canada; I rejoiced to be once again among the loyal subjects of the Queen, among whom I knew were many from the land of the heather and blue bell. MONTREAL is a well-built city; the banks and public buildings are imposing, and on the outskirts are innumerable mansions and villas, all substantially built of stone, and many of the streets are lined with trees. There are an immense number of churches, all particularly fine buildings. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame is very grand; accommodates 10,000 persons. There is a great French population, who by treaty are subject to French law. The streets generally have the names stuck up in French and English.",

    "Description":"ALBANY, the Capital of the State of New York, is a very thriving city, and there are numerous factories in and around it. It seems a great place for lady doctors. Had I been a medical man, I would have thought my occupation gone; certainly my spirit would have been severely troubled at seeing so many large brass door-plates in the principal street, announcing that Dr. Mary, Dr. Jemima, or Dr. Ann So-and-so pursued the “saw-bones” art, or I might on second thoughts brought home one as an assistant , and established the greatest medical firm in the county. A great Parliament House, covering three acres, for New York State is being built of white marble; when finished, it will be one of the greatest buildings in the country, and will cost £3,000,000. One of the leading features of America is the barber's pole; everywhere you turn you see it; and the barber occupies an important position in every hotel in the country. Whenever “young America” is loafing about on a hot day, with nothing particular to do, he steps into the barber's and has a shave to kill time. The Americans seldom allow their whiskers to grow, and as they seldom shave themselves, barbers are in great demand, and do a flourishing trade....The river Hudson has been compared to the Rhine; from Albany to New York, a distance of 150 miles, the scenery is of the grandest description, like a panorama passing before you. The hillsides are covered with orchards and shrubs which attain great perfection. The Catskill mountains, where Rip Van Winkle slept, are imposing; but the most picturesque part is at the town of West Point, where the river is four miles wide, and completely surrounded by high hills rising abruptly from the water. The Military College of West Point (the Sandhurst of America), rests on the shoulder of a hill amid this beautiful scenery. Near New York, the left bank is studded with fine residences, and on the right bank for some 20 miles basaltic cliffs, 300 feet high, tower above the river.",

    "Description":"The “Quaker city” may certainly pride itself on being one of the finest in the States, but the Philadelphians, though they glory in their historical relics, are just now sweeping away many of their picturesque houses, and replacing them with some glaring new red brick and marble blocks, which certainly do not represent the highest type of architectural beauty. The Slate Roof House, with its traditions of Penn, has gone within the last few years, and the Franklin Library has been upholstered in the newest fashion, and now the house in which Jefferson was supposed to have written the Declaration is being destroyed. A change, too, has come over “society.” Once this was the city in which family antecedents were prized most highly, but now wealth has fought its way, and even the exclusive Assembly Balls have changed their character. The very names of some of the streets have been altered, though the principal ones still bear the titles bestowed by the founder of the city, Walnut Street, Chestnut Street, Vine Street, Mulberry Street, etc., taking their names from the abundance of the trees which used to flourish in them. But in spite of all changes Philadelphia retains a very high position, and many of the innovations which are to be met with daily in cities like New York and Baltimore are not tolerated here. For instance, “society ladies” do not attempt to paint their faces and improve their natural charms, after the fashion set by many of their sisters in other places. A leading doctor in Philadelphia told me that a Baltimore lady who was staying here lately attempted to walk down Chestnut Street as she did at home, but found herself subjected to comments which were far from pleasant, and was obliged to abandon the rouge which she could indulge in freely elsewhere, as she was fortunately unwilling to place herself in a mistaken position. The Quaker leaven still works with good results, though many old customs have been laid aside with the slate-coloured bonnets, cloaks, and old-fashioned prejudices. A healthy spirit of activity and desire for mental culture prevails, and the Philadelphian ladies are first and foremost in all good works.",

    "Description":"Fifty years ago Fanny Kemble spoke of “the bitter, bleak east wind—the only wind that blows in Boston,” and added, “it keeps us all in a state of misanthropy and universal dissatisfaction.” I admit “the bitter bleak east wind,” which played cruel havoc with my throat and lungs, but I repudiate entirely the “misanthropy and dissatisfaction.” An Englishwoman certainly feels sooner more “at home” in Boston than in any other town in America. The very streets have an English look about them, and the conditions of life here are much more like those of the mother country, to say nothing of the people, who undoubtedly retain many of the characteristics of their ancestors. It is far less cosmopolitan than New York, which Joaquin Miller describes as “an iron-fronted, ironfooted, and iron-hearted town;” further declaring, that its screaming, screeching, swift, and very crooked elevated railroad is just typical of the city itself—“iron, all iron, iron and paint.” Commerce and money-getting are certainly the features of New York; everybody dabbles in stocks, and Wall Street is the centre of interest. The very boys know how many thousands there are in a million before they learn the commandments. But in Boston a different spirit prevails. Life is taken far more quietly, less at high pressure, and people are valued more for their culture than their wealth. The ladies are equally remarkable for their “independence,” but less for their dress. The gay colours I noticed in New York are not to be seen here. The houses are far more like homes, and if they have not the magnificence of the Fifth Avenue palaces, they all contain more or less of a library of books. A literary atmosphere pervades the place. Indeed, Boston is the acknowledged centre of intellectual culture and literary work. Some writers declare that Boston is losing her mental preeminence, that there are no rising authors to take the places of those literary giants who once made her famous, and that she will soon cease to be regarded as the “Athens of America.” The true Bostonian indignantly disclaims this allegation, and declares “that more culture to the square inch was never known there” than exists at the present moment in the “hub of the universe;” so much so, that “a little English Philistinism would be a positive relief,” retorted a New England journalist with whom I was discussing the accusation of “decadence.”",

    "Description":"My first visit to Chicago was made a year after the great fire, when the hearts of the people were still full of the destruction of their property and the desolation of their homes, 50,000 families having been suddenly rendered shelterless by the conflagration, which destroyed 27,000 acres of buildings in twenty-four hours, and drove the people into the lake and on to the prairie for safety, and husbands and wives were for days in suspense as to the fate of those nearest and dearest to them. Grace Greenwood once told me she regarded Chicago as “New York with the heart left in;” but unable to yield this tribute without an accompanying joke, she added that the genuine Chicagoan had not only learned the Scotchman's prayer, “Lord, gie us a gude conceit o' oorsels,” but had it abundantly answered! Thus it is alleged that when a truespirited citizen from Chicago first visits New York, he exclaims, “It isn't much of a city after all.” When he drinks New York whisky he complains it isn't half as good as he gets at home, for it only burns “half-way down”! The Sunday newspapers can't compare with his; and as for the feet to be seen on Fifth Avenue, he contemptuously remarks, “Call that a foot!—our girls have them twice the size!” Of course this is a gross libel on the cultured representative of the West. The history of Chicago is indeed without a parallel. Fifty years back it was the haunt of the Indian and wolf; and to-day, in spite of the fearful fire of 1871, it has magnificent buildings, law-courts, public libraries, churches, and hotels. The Palmer House, an entirely fireproof building, is one of the best hotels in America, thanks to the untiring energy of its courteous manager, Mr. Willis Howe. The splendid houses on Michigan and Prairie Avenues are models of taste and elegance, and those who have had the good fortune to gain access to the right set, find in Chicago a thoroughly refined and cultivated society.",

Here I was told that while the question of co-education was being discussed in the Eastern States it had been practically settled in the West. At the President's house at Ann Arbour I had the pleasure of meeting Andrew White, then President of Cornell, and I heard him lecture on “The Battlefields of Science,” describing the opposition which had been encountered in every period of history from superstition and fanaticism. The following day Professor Coit Tyler took me over the University, which is organised in three departments—literature, science, and arts; medicine and surgery; and law. I saw the women students attending all classes save the medical; here they have separate lectures and clinical demonstrations. One of these I attended personally, and when it concluded the sixty women left the room, and in another moment their places were filled by men, who listened to the same lecture we heard, accompanied by the same illustrations. “Far from injuring the scholarship here,” remarked one of the graduates, “they are, by their earnestness and fidelity, stimulating it; their presence is beginning to give class-room conversation that delicate, chaste, and humane tone which the recognition of women among the readers of books has been giving to English literature during the last hundred years.” The President assured me that none of the ladies had found the curriculum too heavy for their physical endurance, adding emphatically, “any woman who can endure the strain that modern dress and modern society make upon her, can certainly endure any college course of instruction.” The same testimony was afforded by President White of Cornell, who declared it would be difficult to find women in better health than those at Cornell, and that “the effect of study was far less disastrous than frivolous, aimless lives.” President Warren, of the Boston University, has also recently stated that he could not recall a single instance in nine years of a girl's health giving way from overwork.",

I suppose when one remembers how the city stands in the midst of an alkali desert—that twenty years ago it was “a sparsely-settled village with only log cabins, in which dwelt people in constant dread of Indians, who were expected to scalp every one in the place before nightfall —it is marvellous to think what has been already accomplished there in such a short space of time, and in the face of such difficulties. The streets are full of activity; there fine houses and fast horses; carriages are to be seen with heraldic crests familiar to Europeans, but somewhat out of place in this land of equality. “Yes,” said a friend, in answer to a remark I made, “it reminds me of the old saying, people nowadays use coats of arms who wore coats without arms a few years back.” Considerable extravagance is also to be seen—gorgeous clothes and pretentious entertainments; but at the same time there is energy and liberality—schools have been built, an excellent university opened, and if Denver has the faults, she has also the virtues, of a new wealthy Western city. The Tabor Opera-house justly ranks as one of the finest theatres in America, and I saw it under the best possible circumstances. The Italian Opera Company arrived in Denver during one of my visits there, and Colonel Mapleson kindly invited me to be present on the opening night; so I not only heard Gerster sing, but saw the rank, fashion, and beauty of the city assembled to welcome her. Patti received an immense ovation next day, but I had to leave for Greeley—a town founded by Horace Greeley and his friend Mr. Meeker, on strictly temperance principles. The Indians not only resented the intrusion of the white men, but were rendered furious by the introduction of the agricultural machines they brought with them, and Mr. Meeker soon fell a prey to their vengeance.",

    "Description":"As the days passed by in far too swift succession, the better I appreciated the enthusiasm of those who had made Colorado, with its marvellous mountains, prairies, lakes, and waterfalls, their home, and no one could be admitted into the delightful society to be found in the unique town of Colorado Springs without being impressed with the fact that it is a most cosmopolitan, as well as cultured community, drawn from all parts of the earth. The “far West,” so often represented as a “wilderness,” given over to the reign of the wild “riotous rancheman,” where a race of ignorant backwoodsmen can alone be expected, is in reality peopled by the adventurous sons of Britain and young collegians from the more crowded Eastern States of America. Colorado Springs is, in fact, a very exceptional place, for its wonderful health-giving properties have attracted some of the best people from other cities, and it is really a charming resort. The streets are lined with trees—there are more than 7000 in this small town—and there are few days in the year when even invalids cannot venture out of doors. The dryness of the ground, the electric air, and the bright warm sunshine, render croquet and tennis pleasurable pursuits even in winter. No liquor can be sold, as every deed of land contains the forfeiture clause; nevertheless wine is to be found on the tables of the hospitable and wealthy inhabitants.",

    "Description":"San Francisco may well boast of its location. Naples and Edinburgh justly pride themselves upon their surroundings, but the “Queen,” or “Bay City” of California is simply perfect; with the Pacific Ocean at her feet, the Golden Gate which leads to the harbour, and the hills on all sides, she has a position of unrivalled beauty. The drives through the Park to the Cliff House and to the Presidio, the military post, and to Fort Point, are magnificent. A few years since this park of 11,000 acres was a sand waste. Now it is covered for the most part with grass plots, thousands of trees have been planted in it, pines, cypresses, mimosas, and the evergreen Australian gum-tree; the brilliant scarlet geraniums are growing eight feet high, and flowering shrubs on all sides delight the eye, while the air is filled with their sweet fragrance. The Golden Gate is of course seen to most perfection by those who enter the harbour by sea, but I was quite content with looking at it from the surrounding hills, and I shall long remember a pleasant day spent at the Cliff House, where some Californian friends entertained us at luncheon, and we spent the afternoon watching the far-famed seal rocks, where hundreds of sea lions disport themselves—sometimes basking in the glorious sun, then diving into the water, talking in their strange language, with the peculiar bark for which they are noted, their weird and discordant voices being heard far above the Pacific Ocean breakers which wash the shores. This is justly esteemed one of the city's chief attractions, and these rocks and their inhabitants are rigorously protected by the authorities. “Why are these splendid mansions built of wood instead of granite or even brick?” is the natural question which rises to one's lips on being introduced to the magnificent houses of Mrs. Mark Hopkins, Mr. Crocker, Mr. Leland Stanford, and other millionaires in California Street. Some people told me it was ordained by the imperative law of fashion; a physician assured me “that stone houses were damp and unsuitable in this climate,” others darkly intimated it was due to the frequency of earthquakes. Let the reason be what it may, the fact remains that the first stone residence has only just been commenced for Mr. James G. Flood. It may perhaps bring about a new era in house building, but the house itself will not be completed for two years. It will be built of brown stone from the Connecticut quarries, of the same character as that so largely used in New York, although granite quarries abound in the immediate neighbourhood of this city. In the meantime the wooden houses, built of red pine wood, and heated throughout with furnaces, are terribly dangerous: when they once catch fire it is difficult to stop the conflagration or prevent it from spreading. Two blocks from the Palace Hotel, a large lumber yard, close to the shipping docks, caught fire one night, and I watched from the windows of the beautiful suite of rooms always occupied by Christine Nilsson during her visits to this city, one of the most terrible fires I ever saw. For some time it seemed as if nothing would avert its progress, and the greatest excitement prevailed. At times the flames seemed nearing the Grand Hotel just opposite, at other times they lighted up the ships in the harbour, till they stood out like so many spectre vessels. At last, in a lull of the smoke which was being vomited forth while blazing rafts shot up into the evening skies, we saw that the brave men had reached the roof, and had the fire-hose in full operation on the burning pile; and after considerable efforts it was evident that the fire was under control. The fire-brigade here is in splendid condition; more than three hundred men are engaged in the service. The average number of fires is twenty-five in a month, and the red pinewood, though it soon makes a fierce blaze, also absorbs the water very rapidly, so that a well-directed stream early applied saves many a house, thanks to the promptitude of the fire patrol.",

    "Description":"I experienced the strangest fascination when waking in the early morning in Mrs.\n Severance's charming ground-floor house, covered with clematis, roses, and passionflowers, in which I spent such a pleasant time at Los Angeles, in watching, without raising\n my head from the pillow, the dark emerald green of the orange groves, rich with golden\n fruit. The trees grew close to the verandah on which my windows opened, and were not\n only laden with oranges, but full of the delicate blossoms on the wearing of which hang\n the hopes of the maidens of most nations; ripe fruit and flower growing side by side is a\n characteristic feature of the orange tree. So heavily weighted were some of the branches\n that they had broken off the tree, and fallen to the ground with the luscious goldencoloured balls, some of which measured eleven inches in circumference.\n But the truth must be told, and lovely as the fruit is to look at, these oranges are not yet as\n pleasant to the taste as those grown in Florida. This is said to be owing to the growth of\n the tree; so time, the great cure for all human ills, will doubtless come to the rescue in due\n course. Already tropical fruits of all kinds are growing,—lemons, limes, citrons, pomegranates,\n figs, olives, etc., and no part of the Pacific coast has made such wonderful strides during\n the past few years as Southern California, for everything grows here with spontaneous\n productiveness, without fear of frost or blight. The great question on which the permanent\n prosperity and growth depend is that of irrigation , in consequence of the lightness of the\n usual rainfall.\n This year, however, will be celebrated as an exceptional one in the farmer's calendar, for\n ere I left the quaint old Spanish town, “the city of the angels,” I watched the orange groves\n through the driving rain, and saw the golden balls scattered on the ground as thickly as the grass in an English orchard is strewn with pears and apples after an autumn storm. I\n realised also what a flood can do in the “glorious climate of California.”...I left Los Angeles knee-deep in mud. Piled up all through the principal thoroughfares were\n high mounds of mud to render the streets at all passable, and as these were allowed to\n remain for days, to the danger of health as well as safety, some local satirist carved fancy\n wooden tombstones, on which was written: “Sacred to the memory of the City Fathers,”\n and placed them in derision on the mounds. The day after I departed the largest reservoir\n in the city burst and destroyed the lower portion of the town; and so disastrous did the\n floods prove to the Southern Pacific Railroad that our train was the last for five days to\n leave the dépôt, and traffic was suspended in all directions.",

    "Description":"The entire length of one of the main arteries of the city is traversed by a railway which passes over the passengers' heads, upon a level with the first floor of its houses. Other of the great thoroughfares are traversed upon the level roadways by tramcars passing in quick succession. Omnibuses of an ordinary kind convey the traffic through the less important localities. All classes use them, and both sexes. A remarkable phenomenon pervades them all—they always appear full, and yet never refuse a fare, and somehow or another the passenger becomes amalgamated with a mass of humanity, the car continues its journey, and the conductor his invitations in the most emphatic manner. The civility and attention of all the servants, and the good taste prevailing amongst the miscellaneous mass who mingle in the vehicles, renders the absence of all restriction as to numbers compatible with comfort. Ladies habitually use them; indeed, as far as my observation went, the fair sex require no protection, either in the public conveyances or the public streets, beyond what is afforded by the good taste of the population. Whilst I am upon the subject of the streets of New York and their occupants, I cannot forbear recording with gratitude a trait which I most peculiarly appreciated in the obliging civility and good nature shown invariably to myself and, I assume, generally to the puzzled strangers in the city, by affording them information and the necessary directions as to the localities they are in search of. The following incident will, I am sure, be read with pleasure by the English public.",

And of this I had a vivid example in a barber's shop, where I deposited myself to get shaved. The town is, I should think, little frequented by travellers, and I suspect it got wind that a ‘real Britisher’ was to be found under circumstances which would make it difficult for him to escape. The proprietor of the shop certainly appeared this morning to be much patronised, but it really afforded me great pleasure, after the operation upon me was concluded, to answer the questions, civilly, although without apology, asked me by the people of various denominations, collected together upon this occasion.",

    "Description":"Before, however, I proceed to offer, as I do with the greatest diffidence, my impressions of the people, let me endeavour to give my readers some idea of the locality itself. This cannot be done by a description of the scene, presented as it was to my vision in a winter garb, for, bright as was the sun, clear the atmosphere, and invigorating the air, the beauty of the country required the early months of summer to be really appreciated. Although the city itself appeared to consist only of three or four long and uninteresting streets, it was in point of fact a portion of a square, made up of villas and cottage residences, and every inch of ground was utilised by a fruit tree, apple and peach being the most prominent. The surface of the land was undulating, and at the period of the year to which I want the imagination to be directed, the eye would be met on all sides with the exquisite colouring of an orchard, and all its varied hues burnished by the beautiful sunlight that prevails, whilst the heavy morning dews, drawn from the boughs by the rising luminary, would add to the view a perfume that requires to be experienced, for words are too feeble to describe it. This flight of imagination is fully justified by the description of many persons who have witnessed and appreciated the glorious scene. I ought in mentioning all the open spaces as being filled by fruit trees to have excepted the two or three main streets, the one especially in which the principal hotels were situated. These were planted with other trees, the names and nature of which I really do not remember, forming walks similar to the Boulevards in Paris, and in the summer time affording agreeable shade for the passengers, and under most of them seats are conveniently arranged. The soil was, I imagine, favourable to the growth of every kind of tree, for in the town itself, as well as in the surrounding country, they were extremely luxuriant....The people in Salt Lake City are divided between those who are Mormons and those who are not; and the former are looked upon with envious eyes, not I imagine for their property in wives, but because they possess loaves and fishes of a real marketable value. In fact they have got hold of the plurality of offices and employments of any importance; and whilst I was staying in the city a cause was going on in the Court of Appeal, upon a question whether they, being outside the State, were capable of holding them. It was on appeal from a decision of a single judge adverse to them, and who was also one of three judges constituting the court; and it was believed that if the judgment had been sustained a very serious and probably sanguinary disturbance would have been the consequence, as the appellants were prepared to resist by force any attempts to carry it out, and there was no doubt that those who would have benefited by the decision were equally determined to support it.",

    "Description":"The entrance to New York from the sea I like very much. The statue of Liberty stands on a little island facing the entrance, and then the two fine rivers which have New York between them branch off right and left; and they are fine rivers, and what is more, the tide rises and falls so little as compared with our coast, that the boats can be kept afloat alongside piers, and hence docks are unnecessary. Each company has its own landing stage, and really the water frontage has a most business-like appearance. The water is covered with steamers of all sizes. We got up in good time; after breakfast went down town, saw the public buildings and general character of New York. The Brooklyn Bridge is certainly the finest thing to be seen. It is, I should say, more than a mile long, has two lines of rail, two cart roads and a wide foot-passage over it, and is the best designed thing of the kind I have ever seen. Frank is writing a description of it, so I shall not. The peculiarities of New York, as far as I have yet seen them, are that the roads are bad, and the paved footpaths abominable. The telegraph poles quite spoil the appearance of the streets; they are not poles but large trees, and are stuck everywhere; and the overhead rails, although useful, must be the greatest possible nuisance to the people who occupy the houses they run past.\n The houses and shops generally are not so fine as I had expected, but there are a few which I suppose are specimens of what will be seen in a few years—very fine indeed. In the overhead railways you pay 5 cents (2½d.) as you pass on to the platform, and get out where you like; there are stations about every quarter of a mile. The trains run without signals, and follow one another so quickly that they are never more than two minutes apart, and always seem to be full. They do not stay at a station more than half a minute at the outside. We have been in them several times to-day. For two or three hours in the morning and evening they run still more frequently.",

The horses stand better on this asphalte than any other, and if it is as durable, it must come more into use. He also took me to look at Lake Erie, which is narrow at the Buffalo end. We looked at the coal-loading arrangements and the docks. Saw a very good system of feeding boilers to burn small coal and avoid smoke, of which I shall get full particulars.

    "Description":"Started at 8.10 for Pittsburg. First part of the ride by rail was not very interesting, as the fields were bare, and there was little else to look at. Later on we came to a lot of woodland, where the trees had been allowed to blow down and rot, the old stumps remaining by thousands. There seems to be the greatest waste of timber and land about here, and everything is most untidy and desolate. As we neared Oil City we found traces of the oil wells, mostly, however, unused. Then came Oil City itself, a strange place —pumps put up everywhere, and large tanks to hold the oil. It seems that only a small pipe is put down to each well, and a little engine and a very rough pump put up. The oil is then conveyed in pipes to places where it is refined, and these places are owned by large companies, who buy the oil of the small men and control the market. There is considerable waste, and the river—which all along here, and in fact to Pittsburg, runs by the side of the line—is covered with it. The town of Oil City is rather an important place, and the centre of a considerable trade. Just after we left it we found the first indications of the natural gas, which was burning in several places to waste on the ground, not the least curious being a large flame from the top of the water in the middle of the river. The journey on to Pittsburg was a beautiful and interesting one, the banks along the river being high and well wooded. The oil wells have a scaffolding of timber not at all unsightly over each, and in many places there are small coal drops over the railway. Coal is found all along this district at a level of from 200 to 300 feet above the river; the seam is some six or seven feet thick and the coal good. As we neared our journey's end the symptoms of the presence of natural gas became greater. Villages were lit by it, common lamp-posts being placed at the corners of the streets, with a large torchlike flame to each burning day and night. We arrived about 7.30 at Pittsburg, put up at the Monongahela Hotel, which is large, and, like all the others we have been in, a kind of public meeting-place. We had very nice rooms given to us, and after supper had a look into the town. We went to bed tired....Pittsburg is most beautifully situated, and is a very fine city of nearly 300,000 inhabitants. The electric light is used more than gas in its streets and buildings, and is perfectly managable. There is a notice up in our hotel bedrooms that if gas is used it must be paid for as an extra; the electric lights, which we can turn on or off at pleasure, are free. The city is situated something like New York, being at the confluence of the Monongahela and Alleghany rivers. Both are very fine rivers and run something like 1,800 miles before their waters reach the sea. There is plenty of high ground round the city. We went to the top of one place on an inclined lift, and had a look at the city from a height of 400 feet.",

They are all well, I am thankful to say. She wants to know whether I will stand as churchwarden at Belvedere. I have answered, will do what Belvedere friends think best. The meeting is, I suppose, to-morrow. Had a good look round Baltimore, which is a fine city and a large port. The streets are very well paved; the public buildings are large and good. Electric light everywhere. The shops, particularly the clothiers', large and gay. The climate altogether milder, although not far south of Buffalo. The one we left fast bound in ice, and find the other as warm as summer, with trees coming into leaf. Many river steamboats start from here. The water accommodation is splendid; something like Portsmouth, only much larger and further in from the sea. Tons of oysters are brought here; you can get them in any quantity at every meal. The shells are ground for chicken food or burned into lime. There was a woodcutting machine here for firewood, which would cut and split a cartload as fast as cart could be loaded. The hotel (Barnum's) was a very large and old-fashioned one, but not the most comfortable. We had splendid ice here. Ice making is a large business in the southern States; I should say it would pay in England. We started at 7.45, but left Frank's bag behind. I hope he will get it in the morning.",

After lunch we went to the Smithsonian Institution in the park, where there are some very interesting things, particularly the casts of sculpture from Mexico, which seem to be as ancient as the Egyptian, and very much like them; in fact, you cannot help suspecting that in very ancient times there must have been some communication between the two countries. The various dresses and arms of the Indian tribes might also be studied to advantage, and the animals found in different parts of the States, or rather on the American continent generally. The Department of Agriculture must be useful, as not only are the seeds and products exhibited, but samples of the earth from various parts of the world which grow crops of plants not yet introduced into the States. We also inspected the marble column erected, partly by subscription and partly by the Government, in memory of Washington. It is a plain obelisk, 60 feet square at the base and 555 feet high, and as far as I can see will not last long, as it is built entirely of marble and the bottom stones are being crushed by the great weight. After dinner we had a walk round the lighted streets before bed-time....We spent the afternoon in visiting the Capitol, which is really the Parliament house, and a very fine, sensible, useful building it is. Both the Upper and Lower Houses sit in large rectangular halls, where every word spoken can be heard easily; each member also has a desk or, I should say, a small writing-table before him. In one of the halls, formerly used by the representatives but now only as a lobby, there are some most extraordinary echoes— the most extraordinary I have ever heard.",

    "Description":"We saw the first cotton-fields along this trip. The flowers, azaleas and rhododendrons, were numerous, the former in full bloom, but no sign of bloom on the latter; thousands of wild flowers and very large creepers, such as you see in pictures of tropical forests. The rivers, of which we crossed many, are very pretty indeed, but I should say very unhealthy to live near. We reached Charleston at 3.30, and at once had a look round the town, as we could not eat anything. The town is situated, like most of these towns are, on a tongue of land between two rivers only five miles from the sea, and the harbour is as good as New York, and not unlike it, except that it is much smaller and there is very little going on. The houses all show the effects of the earthquake; the porticoes of the public buildings are most of them still in ruins. This hotel, the “Charleston Hotel,” is a large one, and cracked all over. They have stopped up the cracks in our bedroom, and there is almost as much crack as wall. The dining-room ceiling seems to have been all down except a small piece in the middle. They say the main shock only lasted four seconds; a minute at the same force would have levelled every place in the city. The people even now seem very nervous. A policeman told us he heard or felt a shock almost every night, but that orders had been given not to mention or publish it, so that the people might be quiet. They seem to have got low-spirited about this town. It was, they say, knocked to pieces in the time of the war; a year or two ago a whirlwind broke up everything; last year the earthquake did hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of damage, and most of the places will have to be patched up; and now they fear an inundation, as the town level is very low, and they seem to think it stands on a bad foundation. Our policeman said he hoped for more thunderstorms than they had had lately, as it was his opinion they would draw the electricity out of the earth and thus prevent earthquakes. There were little machines on the dinner tables to fan away the flies. The black population, I should say, vastly outnumber the whites about here. They are very obliging and seem to be happy and contented; some have nice manners, and all speak fair English. I am speaking of those in the towns. There is a considerable quantity of cotton shipped from here. There is also a trade in pitch-pine timber, but not so large as at Jacksonville. I bought some photos of the ruins of the town after the earthquake.",

First we took a tramcar and rode as far as it went into a pretty district, where there were some good residences and tastefully laidout gardens, green and well-kept lawns. We then got into a tram moved by a cable seven miles long. It has a large engine-house about midway to provide the motive power, and runs two cars together every few minutes, so that the power used must be very great, particularly as it winds round several corners and up and down hills. The outlay altogether must have been very considerable. It seems to work well, but I could not find out whether it was a paying concern. In the morning had another turn round city and along the water-side, and arranged for a start up the river on the following day. Saw Messrs. Warren & Co., Mr. Barber's friends, corner Fifth and Olive Streets, who were kind enough to give us some useful information. The river here seems to be as large a stream as it is at New Orleans, although it has between here and there lost several big tributaries; but I suppose it is not so deep. There is a very large business doing here, every one seems alive. The drygoods stores are numerous, and Cook's of St. Paul's Churchyard would not outdo some of them. The streets are well paved; electric light in common use; more telegraph, telephone, and electric power wires than in any other city we have yet seen. This is now a large place, and will soon get larger, as it is splendidly situated between the eastern and western States.",

    "Description":"We had to get up at five next morning to start for Kansas City, and as our journey was over three lines of railway, had a fourteen-hours' ride. The country was altogether different from any we had seen—all good agricultural land, the first part in small farms well kept and nicely fenced, houses neat and tidy. As we got on, the fields were larger, and we could see we had struck the corn-producing districts; there were also many large fields with herds of cattle in them and some sheep. The towns and villages had a different appearance, and the people too, but all seem happy and satisfied, although they must work hard. A newsboy amused me this morning: on asking him whether he had a certain paper, he said, “Yes;” but after hunting through his packet he said he “guessed he had deviated,” being his way of acknowledging he had not told the truth. The horses are all small, but nicely bred. The land is a dark rich soil; I should think it would produce several crops without much manure. The town of Kansas City has plenty of life in it; we shall see more of it tomorrow. I am glad to say I have letters from home up to 14th of last month, and I have telegraphed and hope to get a reply tomorrow. If all at home are well, we intend going on to the Pacific. Spent the day in Kansas City, a most interesting town; it is the typical city of the West, and a specimen of what has been done here. The place is only fifteen years old and has now 150,000 inhabitants. Steam tramways constructed at great cost and driven by means of a wire rope and large powerful engines in centre of the work, run round corners, and up and down steep hills, and are splendidly constructed. The ropes, seven or eight miles long, last only eight months. The fare is 5 cents, or 2½d., for any distance. They pay well. Trains run to all parts, and the river Missouri is navigable from the sea. There are fine buildings and splendid residences. The people are from all classes—cowboys, Mexican farmers, blacks, speculators, miners, and fashionable ladies splendidly dressed. I never saw a place so like making money, and 78 one in which people seemed to be doing so well. A gentleman informed me it would not be much beyond the mark to say the people were on the average doubling their capital every year.",

    "Description":"We had had several hours through this kind of country, when we came on some more\n rough, uninviting mountains, up which we had to wind our way to the height of about\n 6,000 or 7,000 feet, and again met with snow. Then we opened on to the Salt Lake Valley,\n and the Salt Lake City at last came into view. These people, the Mormons, must have\n had good pluck to settle down in such a place. There are no natural advantages about\n it, except that the mountain-streams can be used for irrigation. They avail themselves of\n this one advantage to the greatest extent. Every street has a stream of water running on\n each side of it, and every garden has a spray of water playing on the grass. By this means\n vegetation is kept up, and I suppose the people manage to exist in tolerable comfort.\n Anyhow, the dinner here at the hotel was one of the best we have had in the States,\n and very well cooked and served. The game dish was black bear, which I 86 tasted and\n enjoyed. The train leaves at 2 tomorrow. We shall have time to look round us before we\n start, and perhaps to bathe in the lake. —It was too cold for a bathe in the lake and some distance to get to it; we therefore\n took a carriage, with Mr. Todd and his wife, and drove round the place. The Mormons\n who are well-to-do have in some cases many wives, and have houses built one beside\n the other and a wife in each; but they say, not above one in fifty has more than one wife.\n In some cases they have many wives, and it does not seem to work so badly as might\n be expected, the first wife having to give her consent to any future marriage. The central\n government have now made these marriages illegal, and are punishing the offenders—\n several are now in prison. They have constructed a fort on high ground overlooking the\n town, and have some big guns and a thousand soldiers in it, so that I expect the Mormons\n will have to give in. However, it is quite on the cards there will 87 be trouble over it, as\n there are five Mormons to every Gentile here. The Tabernacle, a very large building with\n an arched roof, will seat 10,000 people. You can hear a pin drop from the reading-desk\n when standing at any part of the building. This is a fact, as we tried it. The Temple is\n a very ugly stone building not half completed, but already thirty-two years in building. I\n should say it never will be finished. I fancy the whole thing is a swindle by the leaders on the people, who are uneducated. Emigrants are constantly coming in; five hundred arrived\n from Sweden and other countries last week. The Salt Lake is a large piece of water, very\n salt, about one-fifth being solid salt. It is a miserable place, and smells badly in shallow\n places in the sun. The lake is 100 miles long, and has an island in it 10 miles long. We\n started in the afternoon on a journey from Salt Lake to San Francisco, about 800 miles.",

    "Description":"On reaching San Francisco we went to the banker's to get some money, and to the agents to make arrangements for visiting the Yosemite Valley, which we find we can do, as it is just open. We took a steam rope-tram to the end of a long street running on to high ground, and then walked on to a hill overlooking the town, harbour, and ocean, so that we might see where we were and find our way about. It is a fine city, and may be called the wooden city. I should have thought it almost impossible to build such splendid, well-designed, enormous buildings of wood. No wonder these places burn; the wonder to me is they do not all go when one starts. Tonight the boys are crying full particulars of the fire, so I suppose there has been a large one somewhere. We have put up at the Baldwin Hotel, a very fine place, but nothing like so large as the Palace Hotel, which makes up a thousand beds. Both these places are of wood, and wonderful places they are. Some travelling companions, Mr. and Mrs. Todd, came to dine with us here, and we went to the Palace Hotel, where they were staying, to hear the band in the covered courtyard there. Mr. Todd is a young engineer, but has broken up his business in the East in order to settle in a western town, as the only chance of saving his wife, who is consumptive. They are Americans of very good type, but under the circumstances a little low-spirited. A clergyman stopped us in the street. We came across the Atlantic with him, and now have run against him again, after having each travelled some four or five thousand miles since we parted. Went with Mr. and Mrs. Todd to the park, and on to the coast at a place called the Seal Rocks, where a fine view is to be had of the Pacific Ocean and coast. The harbour is a splendid one, large enough to take all the fleets in the world, and the entrance through the Golden Gate very fine indeed. There is an island in front to protect the harbour, something like Spike Island at Cork, and the harbour is not very much unlike it in many respects. The seals playing about the rocks are very numerous and large; they seemed to me more like sea-lions than seals. An old king-seal, well known, sat on one rock. He was much larger than the rest, and we were told was absolute lord and master of the lot. There is no law against shooting these seals, but good feeling and public opinion protect them. We had lunch at a place overlooking the rocks, and returned to the city to dine. After dinner I hired a guide to take us over the Chinese quarter of this city. There are, I am told, about fifty thousand Chinese here; one part of it is given up entirely to them, and they live I suppose much in the same way as they do in the low parts of the cities in China. The shops in the respectable streets are not at all bad, and seem to be kept, by respectable members of society; but as we wanted to see everything, and we had as a guide a very intelligent man, who got his living in the daytime by interpreting for the Chinese who cannot speak English, and seemed to be well known, we got him to take us into some of the worst districts. First we went into a sort of temple where there were five of their gods. These were supposed to be the ancestors of the race this particular temple belonged to, and the records dated back some three thousand years, but from what I could see and find out I fancy it was more a sort of divining-room than a place of worship. There were vases filled with slips of hard wood, each having certain words on it. In cases of illness, it is the custom for them to draw out one of these pieces of wood; the word on it has then to be turned out on some scroll, and opposite the name of the medicine to be taken is given, and the patient takes whatever it may be. Then again there are pieces of wood, shaped something like a boat. These are thrown up, and if they fall in a certain way the question to be decided is favourable, if in another unfavourable. A tray of sand is kept, over which a kind of stick pointed at one end is suspended, and touched so as to make marks....We then went through some of the lowest and worst streets and alleys, some very filthy, and up into an opium-smoking establishment—a dirty loft with shelves for the smokers. A man in charge, in a sort of bed, prepares the opium by burning it in a lamp. It is quite an art, they say, and when cooked smells quite nice. The smoker then takes it and swallows all the smoke he can get from it, passing it out (after retaining it as long as possible) through his nose. The agreeable sensation comes on some time afterwards and leaves them in a sort of dream. There were twenty men I should think in this place, and all looked more dead than alive; none seemed to have enough energy to look at us even. The place smelt very strong. We paid a quarter of a dollar for the information and instruction, and\n were glad to get into the air. A more dreadful place it is almost impossible to conceive.",

    "Description":"We arrived in Portland at 10 A.M., and put up at the Esmond Hotel, the largest hotel having just been burned down. Our yesterday's drive and rail ride was all through Oregon Territory, and a splendid district it is. Portland is a very nice business city on the Willamette River. There are some very fine stores here, and at the back there are capital residences with good well-kept gardens. The people are not so much in a hurry as those in most of the other cities, and seem contented and well-to-do. We turned the hotel register back some distance, but could not find a name from England. As there is splendid fishing, shooting, and scenery, I wonder more do not come. There are two beautiful mountains —extinct volcanoes—Mount Hood and Mount St. Helen—in sight, covered with snow a long way down. The river is a very fine one; any-sized vessel almost can get up here. Several English vessels are now taking in timber, as this is one of the greatest timberproducing States. The lumbering, i.e. cutting timber, is a big trade. A district is purchased and a regular lumbering gang formed, usually about 150 hands; a tram is laid down one of the valleys to the nearest stream to bring the timber down, and a small winding engine is used to pull the logs to the trams. The trees are cut off about six feet from the ground (timber is so plentiful they do not mind how much they waste). It is then cross-cut into the desired lengths; one man does this, even for the largest logs, and they are sent down to the mill, usually on the creek. The men get 1¼ dollars a day and their food; the foreman this year 85 dollars a month. The cook of the camp is an important personage and well paid. The men are a rough lot, work ten hours a day, and gamble and sleep away the rest of the time. A tree six feet through and 200 feet high is not at all an unusual size.",

The country round is well cultivated; in fact, almost as well as one of the home counties of England. It is not a great manufacturing town, but I suppose has a large trading business as the centre of a fine agricultural district. The buildings are very large in some cases, and the foundations have to be piled, as it is on a sand. The bridges over the Mississippi are high up and useful, but not beautiful. The roads are paved in most cases with round wood blocks. This hotel, the Ryan, is built by a man who made a very large fortune in California in mining, and is now spending it in blocks of buildings in this city. He must be a man of considerable judgment and very rich, as it is splendidly built and very well managed by himself. The portion he has built cost £150,000, and the size is now being doubled. There are some fine residences and roads on the high ground, some of the roads paved with asphalte; and electric light everywhere.",

    "Description":"Went to Minneapolis this morning. It is a very well built, fine city, and increasing very fast. There were 30,000 immigrants to it last year. The buildings are almost all stone and brick, and the streets well paved. The chief source of wealth is the power given by the river Mississippi here, as there are falls of 50 feet and an immense volume of water. The falls have been lined over with wood to keep the rock from wearing away, as it is soft; and the water is led, part of it at least, into channels by the side, and turbine-wheels fixed, producing an enormous power altogether, but still not half of it is utilised. The Knights of Labour have just begun to build a trade hall at Minneapolis. There is great fear here that they will run up labour too high, and injure the trade of the country. Labour is at present very unmanageable, but a good feature in it is, that when men do work they work well, and do not skulk, as some of our English mechanics do. We went over one large flour-mill, Pillsbury's. It is a sample of what enterprise will do. The power is derived from two turbine wheels, 54 inches diameter and 4 feet deep, with a head of water of 50 feet. This they say gives an effective power of 2,400 horses. There are 240 pairs of rollers in it on one floor; the rollers were made in Buffalo. The wheat is run through seven times, or rather through seven pairs of rollers, and the flour finished by ordinary stones. The whole concern works like a piece of clockwork, and turns out 7,000 barrels of flour in twentyfour hours. They have other mills, making their output altogether 10,500 barrels daily, or sufficient to feed two cities the size of New York. They have two immense elevators in Minneapolis for storing wheat, and have small ones at almost all the railway stations in the surrounding wheat districts, all in communication with the chief office by wire, so that supplies of wheat can be got along as required. They have a railway into the mills, and use two hundred trucks a day to take wheat into, and the productions of it out of, the mills. They have a fine system of precautions against fire: sprinklers which come into play at temperatures below fire heat, and tell-tales which give indication at a less high temperature. The water-power used in these mills as well as the mills belong to the Pillsburys, on whom I called, and found to be very nice people. Their agents in London are Messrs. W. Kline and Son, of Tower Street. The one drawback is that for three months in the winter the sources of the river are frozen, and they are therefore obliged to have a stand-by in the shape of steam engines, which they use during that time. Everything that could be done to save labour was done; the casks were delivered at a spot where they rolled themselves into position and counted themselves. The sacks were put into a spout with a slope to it and then a slight rise, so that they sprung themselves into the conveyances 164 used to remove them. No wonder our millers have a hard time of it with such competition, and I am afraid it looks like lasting. Of course this mill is only one of a number, but I suppose the largest. The best hotel in Minneapolis is large, new, and built of brick and stone. The buildings and shops are altogether excellent. We return to St. Paul in time for dinner, and leave tonight at 8.40 for Chicago.",
